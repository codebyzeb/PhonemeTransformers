could be brown
laura wants blue don't you

we have to decide
we want blue is a nice color to be
i think it should be something restful and cool

go on
it seems light if it's if the blue was dark it seems light
i see
you know we could make it a very
yeah
it shouldn't have a satinny finish on it that would

since when he was a year and a half
you know what
once when he was a year old and he had somebody to babysit
they said andrew could you babysit this kid for five minutes
and he said gaa
and that was yes
and so he left they left their three tiny new babies
they left him with some triplets
and so
he babysit those triplets
and then somebody else said andrew could you babysit my kids for twenty minutes
and and he went yeah
and at that point he was a year and a half
and and so babysitted eight kids for
for
instead he babysitted eight kids for a hour
and then once he babysitted ehrm
a hundred kids for
for
twenty four hours
i mean for twenty eight hours
yes there is
look
see the snakes the treasure box

well
since everyone since one person is
okay
he's gonna tell us where
he needs us to get something
and that
we need he needs us to get something
he's a loud sleeper
okay
this is a loud sleeper
pretend we had plenty of time
you try jump sue
we have so much time
you know that
okay
see how many jumps i can do in a row
okay
you help count okay
we need
i move the chair
oh
thank you
oh
you wanna go
oh
boys and girls
mostly boys
is that
they couldn't get it that time because
one
two
it's hard
i can do two in a row
i could do three in a row but i just don't get it
i wonder if
i got the
one
seven
oops said
i keep stopping
that's what he does
i keep stopping
me and him had the same jump
and this jump is a really hard jump
one two
ooh
i can't
now
everybody
here goes the real thing
i hope
one two
no
that dumb person's in the way
everything away
out
okay
now i've got a big place
oooh
i wasn't ready really ready to
now
see how my arms go like this
one
oh
i never started out jumping like
i'll try it that way
it's hard to turn the rope
oops
i think it's easier the other way
woo
that was good
that was about three
that's strange sue
now
oh don't
oh oh
alright
the loudspeaker is gonna be attached to his chair
and so
when he needs to be different places he's gonna tell us through this part of it and we're gonna answer him through this part of it
it's easy just to give him a like that right
see he can he can really pull hard it's it's a stretchy one you see how this knot this is sort of knotted
and see this thing comes out and he can just give us through that
that's how he does it
okay
so it could be as long as we want
watch
oh
oho
okay
this goes to us
this time goes to us
see who's gonna tell us when to turn the lights out
honey
sue
he's gonna tell us when to turn the lights off
and we're gonna answer him through here
and he's gonna tell us when to get a share a chair is in a order of something there's only one pilot in this plane
and so he's gonna tell us when he needs his this and that
and he needs his chair in order and
we can get his chair in order see
watch
watch us get this chair in order
it's always up here somewhere
but we have to get it in order like that
we have to push like that
we'll his chair
well
let's see
if i went like this i wonder if i would be able to get it off
you dropped one sue
oh well
i'm gonna go back to my project
sue
watch me
this is probably gonna be about three in a row
one two three
and two
this one's probably gonna be three in a row and you let it get caught
one two
put your chair right here so it won't
yeah
i know what you mean
you've been trying that too
everything's in the way
one two three
that bird's now dry

four dollars would realy be enough
maybe five he might earn
hey
how many days
well
how many days do you want andrew to take care of your babies for over night
oh
it can't be that long
it can't
because then the babies would be dead
for five weeks
you want andrew to take care of your babies
five how about five months
because five months is longer
oh
i know better
i know better
i know better than that
how about
wait
i've got an idea
how about four weeks
four months
i mean four months
four months will be just right
andrew starts his first day of school
andrew starts his first day of school one day after four months
and so he has to be it has to be
okay
that would be fine

sometimes i do when he's really busting and i have to nurse him
oh well
just get this guy in the car
it's not very heavy to carry him
yeah
the aeroplane
i forgot
we're already at the airport
i'm used to driving to the airport

no we're not at the airport yet
we have to drive to it silly
come on
what your place from

you can sit on the side
on the window side
alright
time to go in to the car to get off to the airport or you're gonna be late
we have to gets the girl's blanket with the extra boy's blanket
sure
kids don't need their big blanket
no no no no no
getting you right in the back
just give me the babies
just give me their their blankets and stuff
i've gotta get different blankets
it's not the white blanket
you can have this blanket but this isn't the white blanket i meant okay
there's a white blanket in here somewhere
hey
i've got a great thing to be one of your baby's blankets
this sort of nightie kind of
here
could could i put in on her
no
pretend it was her pyjamas
that would be nice
yeah
yeah
you need to put them in their pyjamas
he's in his pyjamas
he's in his summer pyjamas
but she's cold blooded and so she needs
right
clear up your other babies in the lights of the
your babies have don't they
yeah
this this one
yeah
well
you know what
this thing that i clean all your babies sort of like a blanket
because i used to use it with shauna
and i would never take a blanket along you know what it would do
it would just slip off and on like that
it and it's always so long on her you know
shauna was like your baby
she was wobbly and stuff
see
shauna's my child
oh yes
see how
see how it sorta goes off her arm and goes down like that
see what i mean it's sort sort of like a blanket
so you
i'm having
hey
she has the same kind of nightie
i don't think you need any blanket
but if you do would need one i think it's good to take one blanket
at least for your kids
yeah
do you think so
no don't
because it's very cold
go to the can't you see out there
we have to drive to the airport but right now it's hot
but when we drive to the airport it's gonna be cold it's gonna be a little bit cooler
it's probably gonna be rainy
it's gonna be raining very hard
that's gonna be very that's gonna be very cold for ehrm
you know it's gonna be very cold
see if she's got the same hide
i'm just letting out
these cars are going here
well
this one's very cute for jonathon
i thought it was very nice
or do you want another special thing like that
hey
i've got a better idea for your baby
instead of that shirt i've got a better shirt for your kids
how about if you use this sweater instead of that shirt
yeah
but not this this is too warm
no
it's too
no
it's not too warm
it's too cool
it's too cold
and so you're gonna have to change both of your babies in to something warmer
yes
that's her diapers
so
are you going crazy or something
oh man
this won't even fit through it
you know what we're gonna have to do with your baby
see the sweater
her arms are so tiny
and the sweater arms are so big
that's what i used to do with shaunathon
i had to
and her head would always turn around
she always liked
and that's problem with you
probably
i'm not sure
don't put on your tape on diapers
new pocket
yeah
did never did what
those what
yeah
we never did
here sue
how do you like that
that looks really warm
and you know what
if you need to cover her legs up see what there is
just put her legs through there
sean
sean
i used to have this we used to go to the north pole every summer every summer
and it would be winter in the north pole it keeps light the the snows
sean liked the snow
and when anne was just a tiny little baby and i used to use this on on ehrm sean
just to keep i mean ehrm
yeah
on sean because andrew was just getting born
you know he got born at the north pole
andrew got born at the north pole
that's why he's so
right
your house didn't break down
but me and you are still good friends you see
that's what it does
i keep the lens warm too
but i think you need the leg leggings on
we really used to go to the north pole and you really need something warm
this isn't a sweater
this is a suit
arms are
yeah
it's a pajama
and you can us it as a nightie or a pajama
it goes like that
let me see if you need that if you need if it's too short
see
look what you can do
see it even keeps her neck warm and that's really good
isn't that a nice thing
see
so that's really good
i like that
i like that
yeah
because they're right in here
right
so she's really warm
you see what would happen see
it's all it's all
squeeze the back of her neck
it's really
geesh
i know about cuts
it's dried up blood
see
and what you can also do is sort of make a sash if you if you're not using the pants part
how about that
you're not using the pants part so why don't you make a
yes we can
yes we do
yeah
pretend you do
you know why
because then it won't get in your way and and you know what could happen
we could lose that suit because someone could step on these things
and then they could be stepping on it stepping on it stepping on it on the plane and you will lose your baby
it would stretch
and it and that won't stretch
that will only stretch the knot
and you'd be home at sea
so if the knot gets tighter and tighter you're baby will start crying right
and so then the lady who was walking at her or man who was walking on it would look back and say well that's attached to a baby i'd better save i i don't know what that's attached to you see
if it wasn't if it if see if it it was if it wasn't in a knot
if it wasn't in a knot it would stretch see
and the
they look when your baby starts crying because the it it shoes get poured away
you know you would have to run through a big crowd
and you might and you might miss the plane
so think when you were supposed to get off and then go somewhere else you know that
it would be very hard
you see
so it's better to be in a knot
then you see so then it would only stretch to there
oo oo oof
maybe he won't even cry see
so that's much better
see this one
she won't even cry
see what i mean
see what i mean
here
this baby's awake
she's having a great time
can i say hello to her
i think this one is melinda right
this one's melinda
hello melinda
she needs her snapped
here
here's another thing i used to use use on sean
and everything will be it see
this is everything i used to use on sean
see what i mean
she won't be cold
no way
this hole this hole
oh
of course she would have
this
it looks so it looks so cool
and it feels so cool if you're if you're not in it
but if you are in it
boy
are you warm
yeah
that's a nice too
see that
see
isn't this nice
see there
look
okay
okay
i'll get all your stuff out of your purse
you lost your wallet
is that all you have in your purse
right
alright
here's my purse

okay
is it okay if the survival bag goes next to you

and andrew's gonna go
well andrew won't you sit here
a good idea
sue's baby's
he doesn't take much room though
yeah
and could andrew take care of some of your baby's for you
he knows how to take care of babies he's had lots of them in his family
and sometimes he even has to babysit shaunathon shaunathon will do bad things
the baby's while me and you are out
just like you
sometimes once he babysitted for a whole ehrm for a a whole week
he babysitted shaunathon and everybody
shaunathon helped a little but she was bad most
and you can take care of one of sue's baby's for her
yeah yeah
no
this is no
oh
melinda
sue
you don't have to worry
yeah
yeah
she'll go
that's how she says that sometimes she'll cry
that means she's very happy
yeah
your only just
yeah
i like babysitting baby's especially if i get a reward
now sue
i want to tell you something
you know you don't have to look one bit at melinda
if she is getting in to trouble and melinda's starting to cry andrew will take care of it
and if melinda if melinda and jennifer start to cry just worry about jennifer
he will take care of melinda
you know what you can do if i go like that
his other arm he likes he often likes to go like that
you know that
and he likes to go like that and maybe go like that
can you really keep
see
okay
yeah
that means more
sue
he's not gonna go here
i'll show you boxes
oh
your baby can just go right there
she's gonna take care of some of the kids too
yeah
and he likes to go with sue he says
you know what's the matter with him
he feels sad and he needs a grown up to help him
and whenever he starts to cry all he really needs is someone to rub him and help him
i think you can do that now
do you mind if you take care of another baby for me
well you know where you can put her if you don't need to hold her
in here
i know
now come on
now
i tell you what
could you take care of both of them
then we could rub his leg or something
yeah
because you know he really feels sad
and he doesn't like it
you can rub his face with this hand
you know
he really feels sad
he feels jealous
you know
some of his brothers and sister's really mean
see what they need
and you know they all have to be nursed and andrew sometimes is cranky and he's and he's and andrew's mostly awake and playing around with the other babies
and he sees the other babies and he sees me taking care of the other babies and playing with them

it's not alright to make the yucky noises
what yucky noises
person who made it knows what i'm talking about

i said the person
it wasn't you was it
i know who it is
you know what you used to do when you were a baby when i fed you food like that
like apple
you used to spit it back out at my face
remember that time said she was feeding freddy when he was a baby
and he sneezed with the food in his mouth right on her
did you apple you both liked
that you didn't spit out
but practically everything else i made you you'd spit it right out at me
anything else
but you like carrots and apple but you didn't like liver
i went to all the trouble of making this liver for you
you would take one mouthful of it and then you would take your tongue and spray it all over the place
you'd go
then it sprayed everywhere

it was awful
bad

yes
it's very confusing about god
i don't understand very well about god myself
about god
yeah
i i have trouble explaining it to you laura
because i don't know the answer
i don't think daddy knows the answer about god either
maybe
what what would you like to know and maybe i can help you
who
oh
what
people meet together to talk and to sing and to celebrate thinking about god but they can't really see him
he's not something that we can see
he's something that we can talk about and think about but he's not something that we can put our hands on and touch and see
well
i have never heard him talk
maybe
that's possible that he's an invisible person
that's true
maybe he could what
yes
but invisible things can move around
that's right
that's right
maybe he's right here in this room and we can't see him or hear him or smell him or hear him
well
yeah
i'm not invisible am i
and i could love you too
i
maybe we'd better
well
we can talk about it
i don't mind talking about it
you don't wanna want to or you do wanna want to
oh
well
we're not gonna going to listen to this
her ding sounded a bit squeaky but cheeky didn't mind
she loved to sing
just then a little bird flew down onto the window
tweet
tweet he sang
he was for the crumbs she had left on her sill
tweet
tweet
cheeky blew her whistle
the little bird didn't wait to hear her song
he flew away but cheeky didn't mind
while she combed her hair she remembered another way to make music
you
by a comb
that's right
she put a piece of paper over her comb then she hummed through it's teeth
she loved the tingling music even though it made her shiver
downstairs the tea was whistling
cheeky whistled too
her whistle was as loud as a dozen tea
at breakfast cheeky used her spoon to tap a tune on her milk glass
on her plate
on the sugar and on the coffee
each time she made a different up and down musical sound
please kiki
not so much noise at the breakfast table said daddy
kiki stopped
she couldn't understand why daddy didn't like her music
why doesn't her dad like that
huh
too loud
yeah
after breakfast she decided to have a concert with muffy her cat but muffy doesn't care about music either
why doesn't muffy like that music
i don't either
it must not be very good music
he ran away when kiki tried to blow her horn and beat her drum at the same time
after her nap kiki still wanted music
she and her playmates were having a fine concert
boom
boom
screech
screech
toot
toot
it sounded wonderful to kiki
even the sang
but when daddy came home to put his hands over his ears
excuse me
but when daddy came home he put his hands over his ears
what a noise he cried
it's time kiki learns the difference between music and noise
she is big enough to learn to play real music
so the next day daddy and kiki went to the music store
first the man in the store showed kiki the small violin
squeak went the bow across the string
not this one said kiki
next she tried a cello
it was too tall
you make a cello noise
you know the cello
the tuba was too big and too hard to blow
that's the tuba
right
the harp was beautiful but it looked big too
no
you're not bigger than a harp is
a harp is even bigger than i am
it's a very large instrument
perhaps
that's the one you're gonna going to choose is the harp
well
i don't know
we'll have trouble finding you a teacher to help you learn how to play the harp laura
that's a very unusual instrument
maybe they do have a good child harp
i don't know
then the then the music man store
excuse me
then the music store man played pop goes the weasel on the piano
that's right
that's what it says
so she didn't think a piano was a bit too big
piano was what she wanted most of all
then they picked out a piano that was just the right size for kiki
on the way home kiki and daddy did the hurdy dance
oh daddy
that would be fun to play too kiki said
a piano will be enough said daddy
kiki's piano came in a big truck
she could hardly wait to unpack it
she wanted to play so she banged on the keys
she tried sitting on the stool
she tried standing up to reach the pedals but no tune came out
just noise
the next day miss dingle came to teach kiki how to play the piano
she showed her where to put her fingers on the keyboard and how to play notes
kiki thought it was hard to use all her fingers
she wanted to use just one finger and play pop goes the weasel
finally mother said kiki let's have a surprise
if you will try to use all your fingers i will try to teach you a song for a very special day that is coming soon
kiki loved the idea of a surprise
happy birthday dear daddy

he didn't suffer
no
he was peaceful
and he got himself ready to die laura
he took his nest down and he knew he was dying and he got himself ready
yes
he knew
he could feel inside
a feeling in the air
we're not going to

yes
that would make her more feel bad
come here
but this was pet and she feels bad laura
where are you
you don't wanna want to see
okay
he was very peaceful during and he took down his nest and he knew that he was dying and he was very peaceful
i'm sorry
trying to help you
okay laura
you can
move
you make her feel bad when she tries to help you and you don't let her help you
i'm sorry honey
i didn't wanna want to tell you this morning
i didn't wanna want to ruin your school day
died very late last night
i went in to give him his lettuce leaf and found him dead
and i felt very sad last night
daddy and i felt very sad last night
you're right to be sad
you just wanna want to cry
i am feeling that
hurts
that's one of the hard things about a pet
you get to love it and
we knew that he had to die
he was old for a hamster
i spoke to and she said they'd never heard of a hamster living for two and a half years
and you could see if you look at you could see that he was peaceful
i don't care
you won't need to
should i help you
can i help you some how
yes
look
no
she shouldn't look at
she doesn't wanna want to look at
get off
did i tell her that died
yes
you
yes
why shouldn't i have told her
she would've had to know laura
well
you do crying for no good reason at all plenty of times and we tell you we don't like the crying
some thing dying is an alright reason to cry
cry too
i didn't wanna want to tell you this morning
thought it would be hard to go to school
thought you'd wanna want to be next to mummy and have a hug
okay
no
we love them all their life and then they die and we miss them
sorry
there are all different ways of showing sadness
and people show it by trying hard not to cry
other people cry hard
there are all different ways of expressing sadness
doesn't feel like anything
i don't think feels anything when
the body part of doesn't feel anything anymore
doesn't hurt
it's not hungry
doesn't breath
it doesn't speak
yeah
would you like
would be a lot of talking
okay
two gentle girls
too many stories
you know the worst thing of all would be to not feel sad
if you love somebody and we lose them and you don't feel sad that would be terrible
if some thing that we loved died and we don't feel sadness that would be bad
we need to let that sadness come out of us
but being alive means there's sad and unhappy things
well
had many happy times

yeah right
how do i get that sperm in there
you're right
yeah

alright
you wanna want to hear what you said
there please
this is an extremely important job
i need to figure something out about these glasses of water
see this glass of water
how much water do i have in there
half
okay
half a cup of water in this blue glass
would you pour this water in this brown glass please for me
okay
how much water do i have in there
half
do i have the same amount of water in the brown cup as i had in the blue cup
yes
now would you pour this water in this plain cup for me
this big tall skinny cup
oh
look how much water i have in there
how much water do i have
do i have the same as in the brown cup
i don't
how come
you mean it's more than half a cup o
but wait a minute
pour it back in the brown cup a minute
it's a little more in which cup
in the glass cup
now do i have the same amount of water as i had
why not
it has more in the big skinny cup because it has a different shape bottom
but don't i have the same amount of water even if i put it in the other cup
how come
you poured it back in the plain cup er in the skinny cup
mean it goes it fills more of the plain cup
i don't understand what you're trying to tell me
i see
i see
now let's pour it in this
alright
pour it in that cup and see what you have
now
this cup and this cup are the same
right
do i have the same amount of water as i had when i started in this blue cup
oh
you're gonna going to pour it and see
alright
yes
in the cups that are the same i have the same amount of water
you gonna going to pour it back in the other cup
it's the same
you'll see
now
pour that in the little blue cup
do i have the same amount of water
no
how come
we'll see
are you gonna going to put it back in the in the tall white cup
that fills the cup all the way up
the short now the short wide cup gets filled all the way up and the tall narrow cup gets filled all the way up
you're pouring back and forth
no
are you all done
alright
try it backwards and
okay
short wide into the taller identical cup
do you have the same amount
there's your water level again
pours back into the short white cup
i see
now i wanna want to ask you a very important question
if this were chocolate milkshake which glass would you like to drink the milkshake out of
okay
you pour it into the cup
so that's the tall narrow cup
why would you like your milkshake in that cup instead of any one of the other cups
i see
but wouldn't it be the same amount of milkshake
i see
it looks better
you done with the water
okay
oh
you're gonna going to drink the water up

okay
this is still part of the same tape on june
laura's gonna help me with one other thing that is really fun to do
pouring water
okay laura
yeah
well let's do it with this first
alright
see this measuring cup
see
it has a cup of water in it
alright
uh huh
would you
yes
would you pour the water into this white cup over here please for me
what
yes i am
okay
you pour it into that cup
okay
now i wanna ask you an important question
do you have the same amount of water in the purple cup as you have in this white
big measuring cup
how do you know
it the same water
would you pour the water back into the measuring cup for me
try not to spill it
okay
would you please pour the water in the yellow cup please
thank you
now can you tell me do you have the same amount of water as was in the measuring cup
in the yellow cup
how do i know
okay
but look laura
this this is taller
but it's taller and that one's lower
alright
show me again
how do i know it's the same water
right
you poured it from one cup to the other
and then
right
so that this
okay
laura has repeated the whole task
pouring task
would you pour it this water in the tall glasses that all the other glasses please
oh
and then
that's a good idea
okay
go ahead
okay
now why don't you stop pouring right there
we need some in your measuring
oh you're gonna make it even in each cup
do you have the same amount in each cup do you think
okay
well how will you know when you have the same amount in the measuring
almost
okay you've taken a little water from each cup
now
how are you deciding laura that there's the same amount in each cup
are you looking on the side of the cup
but but this cup is taller
don't you
and skinnier than this cup
don't you have to put more water in that cup
to make it
laura's measuring the water now
she's not putting this
she's not compensating
we're just making it the same level as each cup
even this taller one
it's skinnier than
look
look how much bigger and wider the purple cup is
how come it doesn't matter
i think it matters
don't you have to
okay
so laura just measured the water level
they all have the same amount of water
are you sure
you sure this
this tall glass has as much as this big wide glass
how come
laura's pouring from the wide glass into the smaller glass and making the water levels be absolutely the same
okay
very interesting laura
now if this glass was filled with chocolate with milk laura
i'm gonna fill two glasses
if this glass if these glasses were filled not with water but chocolate milk the ones that you made equal which glass would you choose to have your chocolate milk out of
which one do you want
now laura's doing eeny meeny
because
oh
so you're gonna do eeny meeny on all of them huh
so you're gonna keep this tall
i'm gonna show you something laura
let's pour this water out
in this cup
and i want you to measure how much water
was in your tall glass
okay let's measure
in the measuring
what line does it come up to
okay
the bottom line
okay now let's
okay
now let's measure the water that was in the purple cup
you pour it
don't spill it we want to measure it carefully
how far does that come up too
a little over
so which cup had more
the purple cup or the y yellow cup
purple cup
why do you think that is if you made the two cups equal
by the same amount
you didn't
that's right
you have to put a little more in the yellow cup
yeah
getting a little closer
so which cup needs
in
why do you think you have to keep pouring more into the yellow cup
well how is the yellow cup different from the purple cup
that's right
it's taller
and how is the purple cup different from the yellow cup
yeah
now you've got it right
how's the
how's the yellow cup different from the purple cup
i
i mean how's the purple cup different from the yellow
it's wider and shorter
and what's this one
this one is what
the yellow cup laura
taller and thinner
okay
