one of the interesting things about this with children of this age is that the mutual exclusiveness of the answers is not understood
so that the the chance base is not fifty fifty
i was wondering about that
they quite freely will point to the same one for for both or to both at once or anything like that
so you don't get that concept of of mutual exclusivity

three idiots walkin up and down the sidewalk

you feel so silly and helpless
we didn't know whether to go right or to go left
nothing looked familiar
we didn't know where to go
we went to the ladies room and we had a dime
i had a dime and i gave it to eleanor
she put the dime in the thing that you turn
then instead of pushing it in she pushed it out and the dime went down y know
just then the matron come in
and eleanor said
well i put the dime in and the y know i just can't get in
the matron said
you you didn't put a dime in
oh
oh it was awful
we had a heck of a time
anyway that girl was upset
she went out and got in the next one and on the way out the woman said
well here's the dime
eleanor
by this time eleanor was tearing y know
and eleanor said
i don't want the dime
but i put the dime in
she said
well she was right
that's terrible
they lose more money that way than by giving out a few dimes to people who put things in just as a matter of principle
yeah eleanor says
i don't care about the old stinking dime but it was the only one we had
and she said we didn't put it in y know
next time i go to a wake with them i'm gonna make sure i take money with me

we took off and left him standing there
then we got locked in one of the rooms upstairs near the pool

her and her bright ideas
sarah try holding it here and here and then you can move it wider
see put your finger like this
see how i hold it
you're doing this and then you can't you can't hardly squeeze it
put it more at the end of your fingers and then you can cut better

modesty takes over
yeah
i don't know what you're saying
first you make a line
a straight line
you know
now you're just bein funny
it looks more like an h
she made a t this morning
she was all excited
she didn't expect it to come out i guess and look like a t
if it's so easy how come you make all the mistakes
c on
that's hard work
what is it
it's a dress
a dress for what
for a person
whyn't why don't ya make an apple
i don't know
it's an upside down apple
the stem's at the bottom

this is a w
that's a w
you copy it
yeah it looks like a w
what is it
oh
c
you can have plenty of light
i'll turn the light on
oh you can't turn the light on
sarah what does this spell
what does that spell
can you spell it
what's that letter
you know what that is
s
that's right
and what's that
and this one
very good
that one
that's hard
do you know what starts with a k
what what name
what name
no this is an f
two lines and an e has three lines
see an e has one at the bottom
an f doesn't
oh
you'll be tellin the teacher how to write
long as she couldn't tell why this isn't a z
let's see
what comes next
i think that's an accident
two out of three
i don't know sarah
you never hit two out of three
and what's the last letter
that's the middle letter
c a what for cat
it's the letter you just learned how to make the next letter
what do you think you are
you're the teacher
you think so
yeah i think that is a little better
if you say so
you're the teacher
you're the teacher
no
what did you do
no you show me
a door a peanut door
a peanut what
a peanut lollipop
who's eating it
is there a little girl eating it

huh
most of em probably won't even fit you next year either
you know what that one is
the one you have in your hand

yeah you know what that one is
it still looks like a w
you tell me
you know
no it's not an n

no
when you turn it up the other way what's this
this is an n
that only has two hills
two legs
and what's this one
that's an m
m

you m and
yeah you know m and alright
not very much
find the a and put the a in between and that'll spell a word
there you go
you know what that is
man

yes
that doesn't spell any word
now put that first
put the j first
and then put the a
the other side sarah
put it after it on the other side of the j
this way
now put the m after the a
it has to go the other way around
right
m
y know what that spells
no
i knew that was a natural when she said c a
it spells jam
jam
nothing
the wall
still nothing
no you make up your own language i'm afraid
you're gonna never make a word out of that
there's no word at all that starts like that
you mixed something up in there
that's a number not a letter
can you tell which one's a number
which one
no that one
you and your letters
i don't know
yes it does but it's not a word
that's what it spells but it doesn't mean anything
you can't put it like that
turn it around
no turn the e around
that's right
turn it around
that's going the wrong way
that sounds like when uh
i think it was courtney one day had a list
she would say something and sarah would have to repeat it back
