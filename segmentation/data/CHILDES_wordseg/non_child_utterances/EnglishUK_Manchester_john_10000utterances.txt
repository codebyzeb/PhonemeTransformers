that was a yellow sparkly one
yes
well we'll do that upstairs in the bath
but you're right
you do need toothpaste on it
don't clean the floor with it
it's gonna going to go in your mouth
do you remember how the dentist showed you to clean your teeth
how do you clean your teeth
whoops steady
you have to brush them up and down
and the side teeth
and the top teeth
and the bottom teeth
and mummy or daddy must check them after you've done it
did you like the dentist john
was he a nice man
because you went with daddy didn't you

a ready made field
a
dirty train

very keen to have milk bottles
okay
good
well the cow can get on then
whose turn is it
is it the horse's turn now

you had a red one but it wasn't strawberry was it
it was wild cherry
daddy had the same
no

no
well it's anna's isn't it
not yours
that forest would be very muddy today wouldn't it
all this wet
you'd need your wellington boots
are your wellington boots a bit small for you
is that why you don't like them
it hurts your foot
maybe your foot is too big
yeah
they wouldn't hurt if the welly boot was too big
maybe we have to buy some more
now where do we buy welly boots from then

no
do we buy them from b q
do we buy them from a shoe shop
are you sure
what kind of a shop

we'll have to wash it
perhaps you could wash it in the sink just before anna goes home
goes off to work
oh
hello
we don't often have days like this do we when we sit down
they're very nice
perhaps we could read your new books later
there's one about going to the zoo
granny sent one this week didn't she
about dogger

that's a lovely book
about dogger who got lost
and a little boy found him at a jumble sale

they'd fall over if they stood up wouldn't they
the bus stopping and starting
very good
that's very nice
oh yeah

what are you going to make john
a
interesting
what is it
i see
okay
i think granddad's going to make you a farm sometime
oh good
that's a very small farm today john
they can't no
there's no door
how are they going to get in
a
now you just need some animals

a very good farm now
when was that then
the bull in the farm

very good yes
that's a much better fit
what must go in the carwash
this red car
daddy's car must have a wash as well
very dirty isn't it

i think our neighbors have got a better idea haven't they
they've just replaced both of their cars
saves taking them to the carwash
shiny new ones
where is the carwash
perhaps you can make a carwash for them
find a good place
are you a big snake
there's a long white snake isn't there in the garden centre
did you see that the albino snake
yes
that's a horse
how are they gonna going to get down then
i suppose the same way that they got up
are they jumping
we could make a ladder
make a ladder for them to get down
have to make it pretty tall though wouldn't we
how tall do we have to make this
oh that'll do
there we go
maybe a bit taller
whoops
it's very long isn't it

whoops
john look
it's broken
can you mend it
the very bottom bit
whoops
that's okay
don't know your own strength do you john
do you want me to do it
i think that one's from the end isn't it
it's very long
perhaps it needs bricks filling in to make it a bit stronger
do you want to put some bricks in here
that's a good place
and some more
very good
and a few more will do it
whoops
good
lots of little bricks aren't there in the box
good
oh it's finished
that's a very good staircase
brightly colored
gonna going to fill all these in
it wouldn't be a staircase then
tell you what
we'll put it right at the very top
look
there
where shall we put it now
oh dear
bang crash wallop

oh he's gonna going to eat hay is he
there's another baby coming to visit us today john very briefly
not interested
they've got a lot hay haven't they those animals

it is
that's a good idea isn't it to have a movable tunnel
a bendy tunnel
john

good
and down here by your thumb
and down here by my finger
good
now you can stick it on your paper
stick it on
