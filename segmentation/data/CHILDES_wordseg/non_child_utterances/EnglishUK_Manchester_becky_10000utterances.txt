i think it's gone
it's been out for a long time
it's corn
that it's like this look
only it comes in a tin
all the bits are taken off and it's in a tin
see all those little nibblie bits
you take them off and put them in a tin
no
that willn't fit in the tin
yeah
well
that's how you eat it
when you eat this you see these little bits here
you see these little squares
well
each one is a little bit of corn
and when they all come off they go in a pile like in the picture
and then you you're left with just a core to this
just a middle bit
which gets thrown away then
and all the corn goes in the tin
yeah
don't
oh good
