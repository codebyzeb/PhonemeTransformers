three
three
four

oh dear
i don't think any more fit on that
i think they'll all fall off
slide down there
and if i put that on there
what'll happen
let's build another
shall we build it on here then it's higher up to start with isn't it
shall we put that one there
i think this tower'll get very tall somehow
thank you
can i put mine on now
right let's start again
oh sorry sorry sorry
oh thank you sweetheart
that's very kind of you to give me one brick

warren build a tower
mummy's building a tower look

oh
oh yeah
your slipper's come off
it is off isn't it
warren put it on
i think you're putting it on upside down and back to front sweetheart

there you go
that'll keep your feet warm won't willn't it
is your heel out
oh dear
they're too big really aren't they
for your dainty feet
you're very good at building towers aren't you
are you going to be an architect when you're grown up
or are you going to be like fred knocking things down
okay you build it then if it's yours
no don't
don't bash them with your foot
bashing with your foot warren is called kicking
yeah
and kicking isn't nice
so don't bash with your feet please
oh yes
you're moving it about aren't you
what's that
what color
excellent
always a safe bet asking the color of something that's red
shall we put a yellow one on the top
shall i put you on the top
then can we throw you across the room
was that not a good idea
what's gone
no don't kick it
that's right
you can bash with your hands but not with your feet
well you build another tower then you can bash it down can't you
yeah go on then
bash it
hey
of course
it's more exciting if you have a big tower i think to bash it
you build a really tall tower
find some more bricks and build a tall tower
then bash it
who's that
why don't you count
look there's some spots here
you could count them
more than two spots
how many are there
one two three four five spots

don't know where the trailer is
oh look
what's that
yeah
here's the car
what's the monkey doing
yeah what's he doing in the car
is he driving
brumm
not a very good driver is he
warren do it
the trailer might be under here
look at that
look at that
why did you pull the person out
did you not want somebody driving it
it's there
it's there
somebody's turned it into a car by putting by sticking bricks on it
look see
if you put this over there it's like a car
you can put people in it
or you can put penguins in it maybe
look
what's that
who's driving the car
it's a penguin
oh
penguin's got blue feet
who else is going to drive the car
shall the baby tiger drive
shall the baby tiger drive
where's the baby tiger

that's it
oh no it isn't
oh look
it's a baby whale
and what's this now
whoops
it's just fallen off
what's this
can you remember
it's the penguin
i think the penguin could go in the car with the monkey
shall we put these back in the box if you've finished with them
what's that
yes he's he's i think he's the one that supposed to go in there
he fits in best
because that little monkey's too small
can't see over the dashboard
that's a panda
yes the trailer doesn't fit onto the car though does it
you need a special car for the trailer to fit on
oh yes
whose hat's that
whose hat is it
it's not warren's hat
i'm sure you can borrow it
is it too big
mummy make it not feel so big
look
what's in there
go and look at yourself
go and look at yourself in the television
see what you look like
what've you got on
what color hat
what color is it
yes daddy does wear a hat like that on his bike
no you don't need your bike
you don't need your bike
you'll squash all anna's toys if you bring your bike in here
won't willn't you
but that is like a bike hat isn't it
when you're a bigger boy and ride your bike in the streets you'll have one
and if when you're a grown up man you work on building site you'll have to wear one when you go to work
because these are good hats for protecting your head
in case bricks fall on your head
or breeze blocks
or lumps of concrete from cranes
yeah the man the men working with cranes always have them
the men over the road all wear hard hats don't they
just like that one
except only one of them probably says big boss on the front
what are you making
has that come off the hat somewhere
can i see where it's come from
it's only a tiny bit
go and put it in the bin
no this bin
this bin's closer
well you've not really broken the hat
it just fell off
well it's not broken
it's just a little tiny bit that's come off
i think it's come off from there
i can see where it's from
it's come off from there
you put the hat back on
pardon
yeah
you've got it on crooked
let's put it on straight
that's better
where's the car
warren's not going in the car today
and you're not going in granddad's car today either
but one day granddad will come and collect you in his car
and you can go and spend the day with granddad and nana
while mummy and daddy have a nice quiet day with no warren
won't willn't that be nice
pardon
well you haven't broken it
so what are you making on this board
i'd forgotten how this monkey goes on
he needs to go like that
what's the monkey doing
oh pulled them all off
what's that monkey saying
what does a monkey what do monkeys say
what do monkeys say
they do don't they
oo
crash
okay put it on then
whose car
oh
is there anybody in
is anyone in
you dropped that
thank you
you dropped that on mummy's foot and it hurt
i'll forgive you
who couldn't forgive you when you say sorry so many times
yes you put your hat on
your granddad's driving's not that bad that you have to wear a crash helmet though is it
is that what you were worried about
mind you
your nana's driving is another thing altogether isn't it
you be careful
because look
you see you're squashing the board and there was a brick under it
and then you might break it
you have to keep the board flat when you're pressing on it
and then you can't break it
when it's flat you can press things on nicely
what
what is it
what animal is that
what is it
what's this
no it's a special kind of horse called a giraffe with a very long neck
where's warren's neck
it's a bit tricky to get on isn't it
that's the doll's shoe
shall we put the shoe on the doll
i don't know how they go on
well maybe i can work it out
maybe you slip her foot in like that
pull the shoe
it's like a slipper isn't it
there she is
she's wearing a nice slipper
keep her feet warm
look she's got one red foot and one pink foot
what color's that foot
that's red and that's pink
what color are warren's feet at the moment
they're red aren't they
oh poor doll
she's got bare feet now
shall we put it on
put it on her other foot
thread it through like that
there look
her toes are peeping out at the front
shall we see if we can find her other shoe
here it is
put her other shoe on
thread her foot through
get her toes out
do it up at the back
there she is
she's got two shoes on now
two slippers
nice warm feet
she's waving
hello warren
go on
you shake hands with her
that's not a hat
where is the hat
whoops
oh that's a bit big isn't it
is that is that a bit big for the doll
a are you what are you
are you going to give her a cuddle
what do you want to take off
her shoes
we'd better not tell daddy you've been playing with a doll had we
look you've got everything off
oh and the other shoe's off
are you threading her foot in
what are you looking for
they are like steps
like a ladder
you climbed up some steps yesterday didn't you
onto a slide
what did you crawl through when you got down to the bottom of the slide
can you remember
yeah you did go in a car
what did you crawl through when you'd gone down the slide
yeah you went whee and you crashed at the bottom
then what did you do
you crawled through a tunnel didn't you

yeah you climbed you crawled through it didn't you
what else did you play with at the early learning centre yesterday
can you remember
you sat in a boat didn't you and rocked

a
i think that's a speed boat isn't it making that much noise
the man's riding the tiger
that's a bit dangerous isn't it
what are you doing
are you tidying up
that's the last one isn't it
no more bricks
byebye bricks
who's wearing your hat
oh what if something lands on rabbit's head
he'll get a sore poorly head won't willn't he
a
you put his hat back on
that's it
oh
oh dear
tell you what
if we put his ears up inside it'll probably make it fit better
thing is these hats aren't designed really for rabbits
are they
because they're boy's and girl's hats rather than rabbit's hats
oh dear
no don't bop it on the head
don't bop poor rabbit
i think that hat's too heavy for him
i think you ought to wear it
i know what rabbit can do
rabbit can hold the doll
look
rabbit's cuddling the doll
shall we get the doll out
oh there we go
oh look
you've undone the bow in her hair
shall we do it up again
there we go
no we don't need to do it again because it's done up
warren do what

you undid her bow didn't you
a pretty bow
it's a red ribbon
isn't it a nice bow

i don't understand the question warren
i've never seen a policecar with a trailer warren
and with big flood lights on the top of it
what are you on this morning warren
i could do with some of it

let's put them in the box
one
two
three
good boy
no
he has to turn round the other way
that way
whoops
well that has to go in the long and thin way
that way
that's it
what about this blue one
that's another blue one isn't it
now look
it's a straight side there and a curved side there
you've got to match them up
that's it
what about that one
that's an easy one
here's another one
there's a pile of bricks
that's it
hooray
the red one
there it goes
and these are all yellow bricks aren't they
where do they go
yeah but they have to go in the thin way
that's it
the thin way
you've got it the wrong way round warren
look at the shape
and look at the hole
warren
look at the shape here
and look at the hole
yeah it does go in there but just look at which way round it goes
that way round
that's it
and one more
oh actually i've found two more
where does that one go
where does that yellow one go
that's it
what about those two
the green one and the yellow one
you've got that the wrong way round
yes
where does it go
you've got it
it's not too big
you've got it the wrong way round
almost
almost
just swing it round
that's it
that's a difficult one isn't it
now what about that one
do you think that is the last one
oh rubbish warren
it doesn't go in there
where does it go
look at the shape
okay
take the lid off
tip the bricks out
okay
right
you pass me the box
i can put the lid on warren
pass me the box
and i can put the lid on
that's it
red circle
a blue semicircle
look at the shape warren
match it up
no
it does go in that hole
you were just holding it the wrong way
yeah
you try holding it like that and putting it in
that's it
well done
brilliant
and there's a blue circle
circles are easy aren't they
that's right
another blue circle
another blue semicircle
no
a semicircle not a circle
that's it
goes in there
brilliant
i don't think there are any more blue ones
you might have to go for a red one
there're no more blue ones warren
unless they're in the box
big box
put a red one in
put in a red triangle
hooray
that's right
that is another one
it's a red triangle

brilliant
another yellow arch
another yellow arch
brill
the arches have all gone now
we're onto rectangles
you've got a yellow rectangle
no
yes
yeah
that's a green rectangle
there's a green rectangle
what happened to that green one
that's it
all gone
that was a nice noise wasn't it
now pass the box over and we can put this on can't we
put the lid on

you look more respectable
it's a green rectangle
green rectangle
that's it
it was the wrong way
it's still the wrong way
yeah it was the wrong way
that's still the wrong way
you have to make it thin like that
that's it
why won't willn't it go through
ah
the green rectangle was in the way
the other one
it's a red square
no darling
that's a square
that's got straight sides

a red circle
another red one
that's a red triangle

the one you tried fits
if you hold it the right way round it'll go in
that's it
brilliant
there's no more red ones and there's no more triangles
you'll have to put a yellow one or a blue one in
no
that's a blue semicircle
it doesn't go through that hole
where's the right hole
there
that's it
it is the wrong way
it won't willn't fit in
because you're holding it the wrong way
you might fit it in that way yes
maybe
no
that's the wrong way again
look
it's that way
that's it
brilliant
what about that one
put the other blue semicircle in
no that's the you've got it the wrong way round again
that's still the wrong way round
that way round
because look

poor horse
if the horse was bashed by a mini car it'd be more than sleeping
poor thing
put it back in the field

it's going round and round in circles isn't it
why don't you park your car next to the trailer with the people in
that's a good idea
that's a nice tower
yeah
you build another tower next to it
oh dear
why don't we build a big ramp for things to slide down
if we put that up like that
things can slide down better
it's fast isn't it

we could make an even longer slide couldn't we
get some more
where's the other

straighten them up
like this
nice and straight
you've moved the ramp
put the ramp back

shall we have a little ramp
here's a little ramp
you like running up and down ramps don't you

i'm not sure that we can
let's try with this shall i
i don't think this will hook on very well actually
no
i don't think we're going to be able to tow it
oh it's just mended by itself has it
let's put it in the garage
there it goes
well we can't hook this this one up pet
it doesn't hook on because can you see underneath
there's nowhere to put the hook
it might go in there but
no it won't willn't
yeah
it'll have to go in the garage
shall we get somebody out to mend it
shall we get somebody out who can mend it
oh she's going to mend it
here she comes
she's going to come in her in her little red car
she's going to come and mend it
fire out of the garage please
so she can mend it
let's get the fire out
right
she's going to mend it
and she'll turn it on its side so she can look at the engine
there
mended
brumm

she pops off in her car
and she's mended it for you

i don't know where all your other vehicles are
there's a tractor
that's a bit noisy
here's a breakdown vehicle
can you see
it won't willn't hook on there pet because there's nothing for it to
oh
you have to go very slowly and it doesn't pull along on its wheels but it's kind of pulling it isn't it
not very successful
is she going to drive it
this hooks on best because this is designed to hook on there
but there's noone in it
shall we find somebody to go in the broken down car
a man
there's a policeman
i wonder where the other man is that fits in the cars
here he is
so we've got a policecar and a fire out
nee nee
nee
that's quite right
vehicles drive on the ground on the floor don't they
not on people
poor breakdown truck
it's towing the lorry

has he finished mending it
is he going to go back to his policecar
what's on the side of his policecar
what's that
what is it

you could try that
see if that'll hook on there
that's not very successful is it
brumm
crazy driver

shall this vehicle tow the policecar
what're you after
i don't think they are
the doors aren't broken
is it
why is it broken
why are the wheels broken
oh the back wheels
i think that's because you've broken the friction movement on it
perhaps we'll have to get uncle harry or uncle paul to have a look at it
i hadn't realized you'd reached the point where the wheels were broken
the bus is behind you
they're well and truly broken these back wheels
actually if we take this to sue's today warren
tom might be able to mend it
shall we take
or sue might be able to mend it
shall we take it to tom's

how many blue lights
it is isn't it
and what's this
do you know what this is
that's a light
a very strong light
a floodlight in fact
and when they switch that on so if they have to go to a fire in the dark they can see what's going on when they've stopped the fire
and they can see where all the hoses are
and they can see how where to put the key in to unlock these sliding doors
so they can see what they're doing
where are you going

just put the lid on and we'll get out your kitten and puppy shall we
which are up near the top so you couldn't get them
whoops
so you couldn't get them yesterday
you'd been eating them

would you like a tissue in your pocket
there isn't one in there
your pockets are empty
no
it's not a nappie

oh no
you've pushed it
move your fingers
move your fingers
well you did such a good job of getting him then mummy shall mummy help
warren
you did nearly get him out last time
shall mummy get him now
because i felt sorry for you because you very nearly got it
it's just that your little fingers pushed instead of pulled
well you'll have to get him out all by yourself
move your hand because i'm going to drop the fire
do you know you're a great festering you
right
now pull it
warren
fingers out
fingers out again
look
pull it
not push
you put your hands on top of it like that and then pull it towards you
okay
warren
listen
listen and learn
if you put your finger on top of it and pull it like that it will come out
okay
put your fingers on top and pull
that's it
sorry pet
who needs expensive toys when you have a badge and a fire warren
and a fifty p pence windmill from blackpool
shall i bring it a bit closer so it's a bit easier
right
warren do it now
warren do it
no
you we're not lifting it now
well hold it further down here
hold it here
that's it
you remembered how to get it that time didn't you
you've just pushed it back in
there we go
no
you need to bring it closer to the front
be careful how you push it because you might just push it further away
you did didn't you
you left it on the floor and trod on it
that's what happens when things are left on the floor and people tread on them
they get broken
are you going to mix some cement
well why don't you put the jigsaw pieces in and turn them round
there you go
is that another one
well spotted
right
i want a
there's a bumpy road
oh thank you sweetheart
i shall make this bumpy road a bit longer
well that's rather an inconvenient shaped piece to put in actually
there you go
one bumpy road
we'll leave those pieces out
we don't need those in at the moment
or is that going to cause great traumas
ah ah
put this one up here
is that better with all the pieces in
i'll build
er warren
the train is supposed to go on the track
shall we put some carriages together
how many how many carriages shall we put on
just keep it in the track
it's much easier
says she now derailing it
reverse
beep
is it stuck back on
oh
you don't need to push it from the back
if you pull it from the front
that's it
oh the train's getting longer
brilliant
shall we make a tunnel
do you want a tunnel
we could make henry's tunnel
right
let's get some bricks out to make henry's tunnel
no
i can't
no
i don't know how to read
i thought we
i thought we were making henry's tunnel pet
here's henry's tunnel
the problem is you see
we haven't got enough track to do two two tracks so this train's going to get stuck in henry's tunnel
it goes round
he'll get into henry's tunnel
and he can't come out
oh no oh no
oh yes it can
never mind
we can make that a decoration for the top of the tunnel
hey
we could pretend it was a train with a snowplow on the front
that looks like a snowplow doesn't it
oh
that's an alternative use of my tunnel
see
we'll put the the bits across the top
the bigger bits
no
that bit's not going on there
these bits across
well i've never seen a carriage pulling a train before
no
it can't go in because henry's tunnel's got a wall built across it
hasn't it
you could always move the wall from the front
you could always move the wall
the wrong wheels
no
they're the right wheels
er
i think you've lost some of your coaches
warren
yeah
you did bash henry's tunnel
why did you sound surprised
warren build henry's tunnel
i don't see why i should keep building a tunnel if you just keep bashing it down
oh i can't make it
no
warren make it
no
you you make henry's tunnel
i'll watch
let's put those two close together then you can make henry's
no
put it the other way round
no
put it long put it crossways like that
that one can go up there yes
is that a decoration for henry's tunnel
well this is going to be a wild tunnel isn't it
don't push them all under the chair because we might not be able to get them out
and you've pushed one of the best
pardon
well i'll see what i can do
no
don't bang
don't shove them under any more
it's amazing what we find under these isn't it
there's one
no
don't keep pushing them back under
if you push them back under again i'm not getting them out again
i don't mind getting them out once
i can't reach any more
no
you make henry's tunnel
i'll make henry's tunnel
mind the cups of tea pet
shall we make a fancy tunnel
make a fancy tunnel
where are you going
daddy's gone out
oh your nose is disgusting child
daddy's gone out
oh gross
you just whip your fingers in there and it's horrible
horrible
have you seen that fancy tunnel
with all those fancy bricks on it
look
well it does look a bit like a castle
would you like mummy to build a tunnel
i'm not quite sure how you build a castle
oh
that train is really a bit too long
i don't think there are any coaches missing
count them
you missed out this
well that's not a coach is it
that's an engine
you've got two engines and four coaches and that's how many you should have
oh there it is
air two thousand possible
it was a white plane with a red
it's just gone
let's have a look
no
it's just gone behind those trees
just missed it
never mind
there'll probably be another one soon
people going off to see the sunshine
well that was a big one
it wasn't a little one
no
i didn't see it
i heard it
no
you won't willn't be able to see it because it's gone
there might be
there might be a big one coming
there might be
right
well i'll keep an eye out
warren
what have you got there
you've got a crushed cardboard box
it's not that exciting
you go and tell anna in a proper voice why you're so excited
oh henry's on there is he
henry is flavor of the month isn't he warren
yes
i can see him
what happened to henry warren
what did henry do
what did henry do
he went in a tunnel didn't he
he went in a tunnel and did he come out
why not
he didn't come out because he didn't want to
he didn't want the rain on his nice clean engine
oh james as well
is this thomas on the front
yeah
let's have a look
now i've destroyed the tunnel
look at that tunnel
look what mummy's demolished
oh dear oh dear
good job the train was out isn't it
otherwise there would have been a nasty accident
right let's put this
get the tunnel rebuilt in time for the train when it comes past
oh
that's funny because it stood on the other ones
you've really got too many coaches
warren
if you have three coaches
oh sorry
one engine and two coaches
that's just the right just right
we can have two trains on here
mummy's train and warren's train
oh
there's warren's train coming out of the tunnel
beep
move your train
move
oh the train's going to crash
sweetheart
you'll hurt your hand
don't be so vicious
pardon
the train's come off
has it
why
oh dear
oh dear dear
you do some bashings then
what
well i'm not sure that your finger's strong enough
warren
we run vans on the
what's the word
floor
on the floor
on the floor
now have you finished playing with your track and your bricks
shall we put them away
shall we put your bricks and your track away
well they're in the way really
if you're going to play with your vehicles
because your vehicles don't fit on the track
do they
no
that's too big
they're either too big or too small
well you see these engines and carriages are just the right size
what have you done
shall mummy mend it
how are you doing mending it

i need the wheels
thank you
you put the wheels on there
here we go

they're they're not the right size are they
that's too big
no
that's too big
if you want to drive vehicles you have to drive them on your track
on your mat
track mat
your tractor won't willn't fit either
in fact the tractor will get jammed because
oh look
the tractor can pull the caravan
well just lift
that's it
can you do it
that's it
no
the tractor can't tow them because there's no magnet on it
what're you doing
why aren't they on the track
are they special trains that can go on roads and on tracks as well
that's where it crosses over when we do a figure of eight
what're you after

no
none of them fit
they're all the wrong size
it's not even got wheels

warren
it won't willn't fit through
because henry's tunnel is for henry
it's not for terrence the tractor

the tractor won't willn't fit through dear
the trains will fit in the tunnel because that's what the tunnel's for

there's the thing
if you push the blue thing in in the middle
push the blue button down
it makes it easier
caught it
one two three go
let's see if you can send it under the bridge shall we
let's make a bridge
see if it can go under the bridge
where's the
there they are
just put this across
see if you can send it through the bridge
not quite
shall i move the bridge closer
hooray
straight under the bridge
bridge not fridge
is it a fridge
hey
i've just had a thought what we can do
it did land on the track
i'll move the track then it's got a soft landing
let's put a cushion down
so it has a soft landing
it'll land on your head mate
no
you'll have to move sweetheart because it'll land on your head and it'll hurt and you'll cry
oh
that missed
no
er sorry no
mummy didn't miss it
warren missed it actually
actually
hooray
did it go through the bridge that time
it is sort of
shall i send it through the bridge
did i say bridge
what's happened
no
it'll just
the fire just crash in
are you going to build the bridge again
there's one
there's the other one
that one
warren put it on
warren put it on
you hold it again
warren put it on
that's it
now just leave it like that
brilliant
too late
make a fridge again
okay
it's a very small fridge
you wouldn't fit much in it
shall i send it under the warren bridge
are you watching
brumm
look at your trousers
you need braces on
we couldn't find your braces though this morning could we
i've got a bumpy track here
with the trains on
we've got three locomotives because it's such a long train
the fire doesn't really go on the track warren
the fire could go along the side like bertie the does
poor henry
is he happy
oh yes
they should give you little swapable faces shouldn't they so we can put a sad one on
yes
it is stuck on
all those wheels
pardon
no
they won't willn't pull off
how many wheels are there
yes
they are going round and round aren't they
oh no
henry's tender's gone
he won't willn't be able to do much work
if he's not got any coal to put in his er firebox
yeah
you put coal in the firebox
to heat the water to make the engine go
and if his if his tender's off he won't willn't have any coal
because engines eat coal don't they
what do they drink
what do engines drink
yeah
henry has to have special coal doesn't he
no
your cup's got milk in
and you've just told me that engines only drink water
engines wouldn't work if you gave them milk to drink
there'd be a horrible smell and they wouldn't work
i don't think
you might be able to fit a little car on that one
shall we see if we can find a little car
there's a little truck i think
oh no
it falls off
it's better on that one because that one's flat at the top isn't it
see how that one's flat
that one's curved
that one's not flat
things won't willn't stay on that one
i think that's probably a bit big
no
the big definitely too big
i'm not sure if henry is strong enough
oh yes he is strong enough to pull it
yeah
that breakdown truck goes on best
that won't willn't work either
this certainly won't willn't fit on that because that's a tanker and that's round
i tell you what we probably could do
we'll put that one on henry's tender because that's flat
and we could put this one on there but i don't know if henry'sstrong enough to pull them both
try it
see if henry is strong enough to pull them
oh if you go very slow
oh dear
oh no
what's happened
what happened
oh no oh no
the little one stays on best doesn't it
except you're driving into a cushion
quick
the fire better come
brumm
it's crashed into the track
quick
over we go
the fire can rescue henry
in fact what we need
it has
and to clean up the mess we've got the digger and we're going to get every get everything in the digger
whoops
i'm not a very good digger driver am i
and we'll drive over to
shall we take them to crewe to mend them
here we are at crewe
there
we can mend those engines
i'll go back and get some more to mend
can you mend those while i'm getting the others
i think henry'll have to come last
you mend those other carriages and trucks
i've got henry's
oh okay
here we are
let's get them mended
poor henry
what do we need to do to him
we need to check his wheels still move
we need to check they still do this and that
we need to check the magnets still work
yes
is this is this engine all right
can you check these over
check they're working properly
i think they are
hooray
they're working again
shall we put them back on the track
you want them on the floor
okay
brumm
what do you want the digger to do
where's where's the digger going to put them
down where
no
that's all there are i think
i think henry's such an important engine he really ought to go in by himself
maybe not
is he going in with that other locomotive
now where are these going
are they going to be dumped on the cushion
to be put on the cushion
move that tender out of the way
brumm
i think that's the last one
there must be some more carriages somewhere but i don't know where they are
you want to pick up
oh crikey
i've started something here haven't i warren
now some of these are too big
that's too big and that's too big
and that's too big
most of these vehicles are too big really warren to be scooped up
only little ones like this can be scooped
or this
whoops
warren
just move your fingers
right
you do some scooping now then
i think the idea warren is to pick them up in that shovel really
well if you scoop
right scoop that blue car in
and then we lift this lever up here
that's it
right
to put it down you have to use this lever here
this yellow one
warren
what are you trying to do
you're breaking
but they're not trains
they're vehicles
here's the trains
the bricks are too big
well put the bumpy track
oh dear
that cheeky car driving over the trains
what's it doing
poor henry's going to try and escape
choo
oh no
he's stopped
why has he stopped
because he's got no coal because he hasn't got his tender on
where's his tender
where's henry's tender
ah
there it is
can you see it over there warren
by your vehicle box
hooray
yeah
that's henry's tender
and he needs it because it's got the coal in to feed him so he can go fast because he's stopped
he's run out of steam because he's got no coal in his firebox
well i don't think we need to look in a book at the moment do we
let's get henry's tender on
which book
i don't know where henry's book is
is it
i don't think so
i don't think so
where do you think it might be
i don't know where it is
don't look at me like that with that little old look
i know where it is
i've just seen it
warren
i know where it is actually
i've just seen it
i remember i did have it last
where is
yeah
percy's probably stuck on the fridge
yeah
you find henry
where's gordon
is he happy
he's not cross there
he's cross there
isn't he
put it flat
oh
gordon in the ditch
yes
silly gordon
who's that
rubbish
yeah
you find henry and the raindrops
it's near the beginning isn't it
very near the beginning

oh here's henry and the raindrops
well he's here
henry and the raindrops is here

there's henry and the raindrops
and there's henry without the raindrops
because the rain has stopped
what will henry what's where's henry
where is henry

so what does he do
does he go in the tunnel
warren read it
warren read the story of henry
mummy read raindrops again
what was the engine called
henry
is henry a silly engine
the guard blew his
whistle
until he had no more breath
and waved his
until his arms ached
but henry still stayed in the tunnel and blew
steam at him
yeah
i am not going to spoil my lovely green paint and red stripes for you he said
rudely

he said
but henry stayed in the
pardon

undo it
warren put it on the girl

stand up
that's a good boy
now just stand still while i pull up your trousers and nappie

no no no
no no no
no
no
you mustn't climb on it
are you lying on it
well actually those bits don't go together
right
now then
let's have a look at these pieces
get them all the right side up
right
let's look at that one warren
that one's got some red ball on it with white spots
can you find another piece with red on it
color like that
red color
can you find another piece
another piece with red on it
no
that's not red
that's brown
that doesn't go there does it
there must be another piece with red on
a there it is
there
right now we've got the ball haven't we
and look
there's the puppy's leg
look
we're starting to get the puppy's head now
oh yes
which bit of the puppy is that
what are these
those are his eyes aren't they
so this is the other puppy isn't it
can we find some more bits of this puppy
can you find the puppy's nose
you find the puppy's nose
can you find a black nose
yeah so that piece fits on there
do you want to put it on
just there
warren do it
that's it
brilliant
now then
what do we need
that bit goes there
that's it
and that bit goes there
where does that piece go
oh yes
well i think that goes there
maybe
brilliant
there it goes
i've got two bits
these need to fit together at some point
right
what about that piece
yeah
what about that piece
no
it's got a bit of a flower at the bottom
where are the flowers
that's it
brilliant
well look
now this has got a straight edge so that has to go along an edge somewhere
i think that might go there
there it goes
and where do you think this bit goes
whoops
that's right
that bit goes just there
so we need a piece to fit this hole
can you see a piece like that
other way round
other way up
you match the white bit with the white fur and the brown bit with the brown fur
that's it
now we're left with these two pieces
where do they go
does that fit
does that fit
i don't think it does
what about trying it here
hooray
so where does that bit go
look
now this has got a straight edge hasn't it
and that has to go along there
so where does the piece go
that's it
brilliant
two puppys
and a ball in the garden with flowers
you want to put it away
you don't want to do it again
shall we get that kitten out
now are you going to chew the pieces like you did last time
do you remember the last time you played with it ages ago we had to put it up on the bookshelf
because you were chewing it and spoilt it
and there are big gaps where there shouldn't be
i don't know why i'm bothering because it always falls apart when i put it in but never mind
slide in
we'll find that kitten
there's only one kitten
it's a kitten and a puppy
byebye puppys
here we are
there's the kitten
oh no
all three puzzles are mixed up
look
look what you did you terrible child
look
bite marks
big gaps
now we've got three puzzles here
right
yes
you weren't popular
no
that one doesn't go there
what i'll do is sweetheart
bless you
bless you
bless you
quickly do these
and work out what goes where
does it
er no
i don't think it does
that goes there
i'm getting through this one
i can see a brick wall
that's why i couldn't work it out
because the blue had gone because somebody chewed it off
yes
yes
you did bite it there
you terrible boy
don't you dare bite it again
bite it again and it goes away again
you've not had this out for weeks
and it's missing some pieces i think
is it
hang on hang on
a you see
that bit goes there
that bit goes
oh it's not missing pieces at all
it's just me being daft
now warren
look at that one
i can see you through it
can you see mummy through the puzzle
we'll put that one away for the minute and we'll put that one away for the minute
get those out later
right
can you do this puzzle
take it apart
and if you chew it it goes away again
no
don't chew it please
right
there's the dog's body
where's the dog's head
where's the dog's head
well fit it onto the body then
er there's the front of his body with his front leg
that's it
good boy
now where's the dog's ear
where's the dog's ear
and his eye
and part of a blue ball
there's one eye
where's his other eye and his ear
okay
no
that one does go there
you just tried putting it in the wrong way round
now look
there's a hole there
which that sticky out bit goes in
that's it
hooray
now where's the dog's back leg
no
there's another piece before that because look
part of the cat's face is missing
can you find the other bit of the cat's face
yeah
so those two go together
that's it
and then that bit goes on here
to finish off the dog's other ear and his back
no
look at the shape of the pieces
look
there's a gap there for a sticky out bit to go in
that's it
now there's one piece left
where does that go
is that finished
and what's happening on that picture
where's the cat
in the window
that's right
the cat's stuck in the shed i think
and she's meowing to try and get out
are you going to put it in there
thank you
shall we do another one now
break this one up
it's only got one piece chewed out of it
look
chewed piece
right
where are you going to start
yeah
can you find another bit with blue on it
that is the cat's ear i think
no
because the cat's eye has to go there
can you find the cat's other ear
there's one ear there
where the cat's other ear
yes
that's a brush but where's the cat's other ear
where's the cat's other ear
there's one ear there
where's the cat's other ear
that's right
and ears go next to each other so where must that ear go
hooray
yes
that must go there
no
find a
there's a piece here warren with blue on it
that's it
that's the cat's tail isn't it sticking up
now there's two pieces left
where do they go
but warren
that's got blue
it must be a blue bit that goes there
that's not blue
that's grey
well i suppose it's a kind of pinkie color
and does that go there warren
does that look right
yes
hooray
so where must that go
and why does that look funny
oh is it because somebody's chewed a piece out
are you going to put it in there
then we can do the last one which has got lots of holes in
one more
look at all the holes in this one
this is where the kitten comes out of the shed
mix the pieces up
can you find bits that go together
you see the dog's ears
aren't you going to do this puzzle
is it too hard
yeah
it's not too hard is it
no
that mustn't go there
look
well there's the cat's face
where's the cat's body
where's the cat's body
it's not a nappie
it's a bit of white fur in the cat's chest
cats don't wear nappies
because cats are grown up creatures
they know where to do things unlike somebody
shall mummy do this one
where does it go
no
you were trying to put it in the right place
you were just being
no
that does go there
and where do these two pieces go
turn it round
that's it
turn it round
because you've got to have blue on this side of it haven't you
you need to look at the colors as well the shapes
that's it
brilliant
okay
you put them in there
another one
i don't think we've got any more
which other one
we haven't got any more up there
haven't got any more
because the er fire one has disappeared
i wonder where on earth it is
yes
that was underneath the er chair
that's why it was on the floor
because it was under the chair
why don't you do one of these another one of these again
yes
are you reading a story
what does it say
right
which one are you doing first
which one are you going to do first
there's three puzzles
which one are you doing first
okay
no
put that back in then it's easier when we want to do it again
when you want to do it again
yes
that one comes apart easily doesn't it
why is it coming apart easily
because somebody's chewed all the bits off
this was a christmas present from father christmas wasn't it
and you've chewed it
there we go
what's happening in the pictures
is the dog sad
what's he what's he doing
did he open the door
and let the kitten out of the shed
because the kitten was stuck in the shed wasn't she
she couldn't open the door
and there she is peeping out
meowing so the puppy will hear
and then the puppy comes and opens the door and lets her out
i don't think we've got any other ones
we've got this one
shall we make thomas
do you want just thomas or thomas and percy
oh look warren
there are two sparrows on the nuts
oh
warren look
there's another bird on the nuts
it's a blue
there were two on there earlier weren't there
what's he doing
that's right
those nuts last better on that branch don't they because the squirrel can't get them
yeah
i don't know what the other bird is
it's not the same as
careful
they're my legs
who's the book about
is he red
what happens to james
is he sad
yes
he is laughing there isn't he
well do you really want a story
shall we do the puzzle with thomas and percy
let's make thomas and percy
you can help mummy can't you
you can help mummy to make thomas and percy
let's get the pieces out
let's get them the right way out the right way round for thomas and percy
right
can you see percy's face
where's percy's face
there
okay
where's percy's boiler
okay
so those bits must go together mustn't they
hooray
now who's that next to percy
right
so thomas's face needs to go there doesn't it
can you find thomas's face
don't turn it over
it has to go that way round
right
can you see thomas's funnel
remember thomas has got a short
no
that's the steam from his funnel
where's his funnel
that's percy's funnel actually so that piece goes up here
that piece goes above here
see percy's funnel at the bottom
the very top of percy's funnel
now we need the piece to go here which has got thomas's funnel in
no
that goes there because that's percy's funnel
where's thomas's funnel
yeah
so you put that piece in
hooray
two smokes
yes
two lots two lots of smoke i think you'd probably say
whose wheels
rubbish
henry's not on here
whose wheels are they
percy's wheels
and his wheels go under his cab where his driver and fireman go
now where's percy's buffers
okay
and they go next to his wheels
where are thomas's
can you see thomas's
that does go there
can you turn it round so it's the right way round
no
that's the wrong picture
it's the other picture
that's it
brilliant
warren
we've not finished this picture yet
right
now here there are some children on a bridge
no
bridge not fridge
no
it's not a fridge darling one
it's a bridge
a fridge
are the children on a fridge
it does go there
hooray
where do those last two go
do those look right
hooray
see whose eye
thomas's eye
there it is
beep
percy's eyes are there
what does thomas say
peep lazy bones
peep lazy bones
there they are
what have you found
james isn't blue
he's red
the book's blue but james is red
is he pink
i don't think there are any pink engines
warren
i'm not a climbing frame you know
cheeky
come on then
do some press
press
can you do press
mummy do
do you know what a press up is
because i couldn't show you one
don't sit on my knees
oh look
there are two birds on the nuts
the call of the red engine
well we started this story before didn't we
we were reading it when the doorbell went
remember james lets off steam
and he blows off the fat controller's top hat
oh no
he doesn't blow it off
he gets water all over it
that's right
who's james pulling the train with
that's right
so how many engines are pulling it
how many engines are pulling the train
there's two
one two
is edward happy
i wonder why
here we go
oh what's happened here
who's that
is thomas happy as well
i think he is
he's telling james and edward how important he is
oh look at those two faces
james is saying it's ever so steep
it's ever so steep
it's ever so steep
and edward's saying i've done it before
i've done it before
i've done it before
and look at all the steam coming out of their funnels
they're really having to puff hard to get up that hill
here they are at the next station
james is laughing
and who's that
and what's he wearing
yeah
and why was james worried about seeing the fat controller
because the day before james had blown steam at him and got the top hat wet
poor fat controller with a wet top hat
are you
right
are you making the edge
what're you making now
the edge of what
an edge and a tower
okay
that's fine
oh yes
the blue one's stuck to the green one isn't it
yeah
two green ones together
where's that piece going to go
where's the red bit going
are you turning his head
what's the man doing on the arch
do you want the other men
shall mummy help you to look
yes there are
there are two men somewhere
oh i thought that was a man but it's a baby tiger
don't know where these men are warren
a
here's one
here's one
i'm looking for the other one
i'm finding all sorts of things warren but not not the other man
we've not seen these before have we warren
the sheep and the chickens
the cow and the calf
i think the other man has got a green base hasn't it
thank you
oh
that's a new one
look
oh warren
what's this
choo
shall we put the truck on the train
no
it's not henry
because henry's green
okay
fine
well i don't know where the other man is warren
now these look like something from a horror film
he's not there
the other man i don't think is in here
i think the other man might be having a little holiday somewhere
quite possibly
somewhere nice and warm perhaps
just feel how cold the doll is
okay
i think that man's gone somewhere nice and warm
yeah just two men
well there's a man here but this man's got legs
you see
because he's the train driver
you see
and he sits in the train
what is it
what is it
oh i think it probably is stuck on the bricks
yes
that's it
it's like a sun isn't it
shall we put the baby tiger on the sun
okay yes
that one'll go on there i think
let's just see
there we go
a whale on the sun
is that too big
we could have a penguin on the sun
perhaps um
the baby whale on the funnel maybe
maybe not
is that too big
yes
i don't think it'll fit on
i can balance it on
a bit hot don't you think
choo
reversing
look
what's this at the front here
do you know what it is
it's a cow catcher
it's like what toby the has
so that things can't get stuck under his wheels at the front
things like cows
warren
just look at your tower
yeah
you knocked that down
you sat on it my love and it fell down
yeah
you mind what you do with your bottom
there you go
coupling it up
the cow catcher looks a bit like the snowplow that thomas had didn't it in the story about the village getting cut off
why do you want to see her tummy
her trousers
mind you
i suppose cousin tom has got long hair
so you might think it was a man
but tom doesn't have bows in his hair does he
well undo the velcro at the back
and you take the blouse off
take the other arm out
that's it
oh poor dolly
she's got no clothes on
a bare doll
right
let's help
if you do that
shall we put her pants on
is that a good idea
right
now what do we have to do
we have to thread her feet in don't we
thread them in
thread the left foot and the right foot
oh
she's standing on her head
there we go
she's got
oh her tummy's gone hasn't it
now we're putting her dress on
and we thread her arms through the arm holes
okay
right arm through there
can you thread her left arm
can you thread the left arm
through there
oh
let's fasten her dress
oh nice dolly
that's a pretty dress isn't it
i think this goes on with this dress
shall we put her fancy collar on
i don't know
what is it doing on the floor
oh dear
no
you didn't bang it with your bottom that time
i think it just fell over
oh look
look at these extra animals
there's even a goat
do you know a song about a sheep
what color is the sheep in the song
that is a very tall tower
look
oh no
that's it
what a tall tower
where's that man now
where is he
yeah
one man high up
one man low down
yeah
are you making another tall tower
i think the tiger's too big to go on that little tower
the baby tiger would fit
choo
here's the baby tiger
on the sun
here we go
what's the elephant doing
i hope it's not going to crash
because that would hurt the elephant and the baby tiger
and the driver
it is isn't it
oh well
never mind
i'm sure it'll find a way out somehow
it's driving over a cow
are you taking elephant out or just uncoupling the the truck
couple them back together
it is
the cow catcher's not worked very well has it
i suppose it's caught the cow and knocked the cow over
oh no
it's got the baby horse
the bulls the bulls are lying down as well
here are two bulls
oh you want them
why
are they sleeping
and there's the mummy horse
she's lying down
oh poor baby horse
oh no oh no
it's run away
and the mummy horse is running after it
picking the baby horse up and she's going to run off with him
into the box where it'll be safe
but is it safe
or is warren going to get them out
oh no
he's getting them out
can't remember how she did it
let's lie the baby horse down again
i think i just did that
that was it
whoops
clear away
we've heard the
i think the i think the points must have been stuck and he's gone off into a siding
there's a nice clear track here
through henry's tunnel
well what
if you take the elephant out you can put the tiger in the truck
lift the elephant out
lift him out
put the tiger in instead
then you've got the mummy tiger in the trailer
and you've got the baby on the sun
will the tiger fit in
maybe not
his tail's too long
oh no
well it'll stand in it loose
no
you can't fix her in because the tail sticks out
this isn't designed for tigers
it's designed for elephants or horses
no
just leave her like that
she won't willn't fall out
stuck in the tunnel
peep
oh no
you've run over the bull now
and the other bull
no
that's not
i don't know where the baby cow's gone
that's the horse and the baby horse
going over the cow now
oh dear
oh no
the tiger's out
she's back again
that cow was stuck
oh
tiger's out again
oh yes
oh
you've broken anna's toy
oh
do you think anna'll cry
better put it back together again quickly hadn't you before she starts to cry
no
i think it goes that way round actually
no
no
because you've mended it now
you've mended it now
oh
shall i get the tissue box to pass to anna
a that's better isn't it
does it all come apart
oh yes
look
you can take it all apart
put it back on quick quick
look
it's a train without a driver
oh no
it's a runway train
it's a runaway train
running away because there's noone to drive it
oh no oh no
good job it's coming to a hill and it's slowing down
quick
the driver can jump back on
it's not running away any more
hey
i tell you what
if we put the baby tiger inside the baby tiger can drive the train
is the man going to drive it again
we should really call it a driver then it could be a man or a woman couldn't it
baby tiger back on top
what's that
what color is it
what color's this elephant
what color is it
is it a blue elephant
is it a yellow elephant
is the baby tiger keeping an eye on the elephant to make sure it doesn't escape
to make sure it doesn't run away
that's a very bumpy line isn't it
might get derailed
okay
warren push the trailer on while mummy holds the coach the truck
no
the other way other end
you got it right the first time
what was that funny noise
is that your jumper
under warren's bridge
bridge
and i always thought you kept orange juice and beer in a fridge but there we are
trains stay in fridges do they
do trains go in fridges
where are those two men going
where are they going on the train
warren
look at it
is it the right way up
the bit of tower in your hand
you were putting it on the wrong way up weren't you
and is the train staying under the bridge
it's getting a bit cold in here
have to keep moving about to try to keep warm
in fact it's so cold the penguins have come
they think it's the antarctic
they're going to huddle together while the eggs hatch out
okay
the man's on it
oh he's cold
quick
get the other man on so they can come out of the fridge
choo
oh they're warming up now
oh no
the funnel and the dome's off
that's the dome
that's the funnel where the smoke and steam comes out
i think
that's the light
now you see that's interesting because thomas and henry don't have lights up there do they
they have lights down here
no
the buffers
no
the dome the light goes at the front like that
because the light comes out so it can see where it's going on the track at night when it's dark
that's a bumpy track
where's it taking the animals
and the men
where's it going
it is stuck isn't it
what are we going to do
shall we get the panda to come and give it a push from behind
warren pull
panda push
oh no
one truck's derailed
and uncoupled
oh no oh no
let's put it back together again
quick quick quick quick quick
panda push
the panda in his car is pushing
let's put the tunnel over the track then like that
well henry's not in it yet is he
where's his tender
there it is
oh
where's his tender
but he can't get out because there's a wall in the way
hooray
mummy put it back in
there we go
well henry'll have to go in before he can get out
have to go all the way round the bumpy road
that's a very bumpy one isn't it
i might have done
we'll get him out later
oh no
he's stuck
is he sheltering from the rain
are you going to move the wall
that's nice
has it stopped raining
oh
he's gonna going to get derailed in a minute
keep his wheels in the tracks
has it started raining again
oh no oh no
quick henry
get back in
is he coming out or do we need the wall
have to slide it in like that
is henry trying to peep out
can we see him
no
we can see his funnel can't we
we can't see his face
oh yes
there it is
pardon
a little bit of what
oh dear
does it need a kiss
well stand still so i can kiss it otherwise i might kiss something else that doesn't hurt
that would be a waste of the kiss magic wouldn't it
right
where is it
is that better now
all gone
it is the monkey
what kind of monkey
what kind of monkey is it
that's right
and what's he doing
what's she doing

i wouldn't fancy sitting in a truck with a baby tiger behind me
now the monkey doesn't sit like that warren
the monkey has to stand up

we'll have to move the baby tiger to the back
then the giraffe can go on the front
she can sort of balance
maybe she can't
if i move the baby tiger back a bit she can sit there
how many
i don't think there is another car
i think you've got enough cars
count them properly
one two three cars
that won't willn't tip back
the giraffe's head's in the way
what we could do of course
there
now that'll tip back flat
that's better isn't it
i don't know where the other men are
you've got one there
the monkey's sitting on its head

it won't willn't fit on pet
men go at the top of towers

if you're now trying to get the penguin on i think you're stymied
what are those three men doing

that's a very tall man isn't it
he's tall
that's a small one
that's very tall
that's like paul or harry or tom
that's a medium sized one
put it on the floor pet
you'll get a better grip
oh warren
that's better you see on the floor
you have a better grip
that's it
now the tall man in the middle
so it is
oh gosh
that's exciting isn't it
taking it apart
putting it back together
you why don't you put it on the floor
it's much easier
that's it
how many men
not two
but three
think he'll fit at the front here
it will go on
that's it
that's it
that's not a baby cow
it's a mummy cow
see if we can find a baby cow
what do you call a baby cow
can you remember
yes
it is the mummy cow you're knocking over with the train
i don't think there is baby cow
a baby horse
i don't think there's a baby cow
that's a baby horse
a foal
here's another foal
that's a standing up foal
oh there's a goat here
you've been sitting on a goat
shall we put the goat in there with the elephant
here's a bull
it's a daddy cow
there's the bull and there's the cow

that's a bull and that's a cow
well there won't willn't be any baby cows of you run the bull and the cow over with the train
that's the cow
that's an udder
that's what you get milk from
the special machine that attaches to it squeezes the milk out
and then it's put into bottles and mike brings it to the house and we drink it
you saw some cows being milked at the farm with gary didn't you
do you remember
at the stinky farm
seeing the cows being milked with those machines
do you remember
pardon
what
what're you looking at
or what're you doing
warren
i have a suspicion about that silence child
mummy's going to build a tower now
mummy's mummy's making a tower
a strong tower
what is it
tell me what it is
no
it's a goat
look at mummy's tall tower
it's a tall one isn't it but it's not very stable
i think it might fall over
don't bash it
especially not on your head if that's what you were thinking of doing
no
if you want to break it up break it up on the floor
that's a good boy
warren can break it up
pull the bricks off
there you see
it's a well built tower that one warren
you have to use force to undo it
oh
no
be gentle with them
remember they're not your toys are they
whose toys are they
anna's toys
you're not to break her toys
she'd have nothing to play with at home
well warren had better put the train back together then
there's the cab
but you don't know how it goes back together
what's that
do you know what it is
can you remember
cow
right
let's put it back on shall we
right
i think we ought to put this back together again
i'm not sure how it works or how it goes back together
well make sure you make it like that then
put the blue square behind the cow
put that behind the cow
no
a cabless engine
a boilerless engine
a funnelless engine and a domeless engine
no lights either
that's a bit of a danger
especially as there's no driver
what's gone
well at least we've got a cab
that's right isn't it
that doesn't go there
you've got a bit missing
you've got the funnel missing
this bit needs to go on doesn't it
are you sure
you need a blue square
put that on behind the cow
right no
right next to it
put it on here
just here
that's it
now the funnel bit goes on top of that
that's it
and the cab goes behind the funnel bit
the cab
there
goes right at the back
that's it
that thing is the coupling where you couple on coaches or trucks
yeah
what a cheeky old dome
i don't know
hiding in the bricks
what're you looking for now
that one does go there
that's it
and where's the driver
well i'm not sure which way round it goes
i don't really think it matters
probably goes that way round

you have to look for the others
you've got one there
one here
and there's another one in here somewhere
with a green body and brown hair
look

bertie's a nice bus isn't he
that's not a baby tiger
that's a mummy tiger
i think they will sit on if you just get that
that's it
yeah
he's sitting on the mummy tiger now
i'm not sure i'd fancy riding a tiger
what do tigers say
that's right
and tigers can run very fast
they can run faster than hippos
and horses i think
oh
you've got a man on a tiger and a man on a horse
shall we have a man on an elephant
three men riding three animals
that's good isn't it
what is it
can you remember what that bit's called
it's an udder
milk gets squirted out of these things that hang down and it collected
and then it's put into bottles
what're you doing
which other one
other what
the hippo
or the man
well look for him
he's got red hair
and a blue top
it's near a horse
lying down
no
he's not on the horse
he's near a lying down horse and the tiger
yeah
have you lost the other man now
you'll have to move this one over a bit
i hope you learn some logic soon warren
but what are we going to do with this one
what are we going to do with this one
bashing them won't willn't do anything
put them on right at the end with a bit sticking out
put him on right at the end with a bit sticking out
right
now get the next one
put it on right next to that one
right up next to it
that's it
now put the other one with a bit hanging over the edge
that one goes there yes
yes
see
how many have you got now
how many
count again
one two three
how many
how many
five
okay fine
there might be two invisible men there as well i suppose
why don't you put them on that one
there's a bit more room
now that's sensible
oh
say thank you to anna

if we put her legs out
now are you going to thread her legs into the trousers
oh
there's her right foot
and oh her left foot
there she is
she's got her trousers on
is that better
i think she might be a bit cold with just trousers on
are you still sticking those men on
they don't need to go right at the end on this one
because it's a long one
they can go further along
now put it on the floor
now press down on it
i know what you could do warren
if we took this truck bit off
we could sit the men on here
where's the other man
are you sitting on him
no
oh there he is
right
are you going to stick them on there
then they can go for a ride on the train with the baby tiger looking at them can't they
one two
where's the other one
you had him a minute ago
stand up and have a look
well stand up
where is it
ah

or a mummy tiger catcher
who wants peace and quiet

you're kind sharing your orange juice with the baby tiger
oh
wipe his tears away and give him a cuddle
yes
mummy took it off so the so these men could have a ride
what is it
that's it
what does it do
well it does look like a snowplow but it isn't
snowplows are closer to the ground
and are more pointy
yeah
a snowplow is like a cow
you're right
er toby the has a cow
yes
it does go there
shall mummy hold the train while you put it on
those bits go at the bottom
that way up

no
you need to hold it up like that
a

i can't do it because you're doing it
that's better

well you go pop then
do you want the teddys out of the basket
shall i show you a good way of getting them out
you go oh
oh no
that doesn't work does it
you have to shake it
shake the teddys out
because they don't get hurt because they're in the water
they're out now
of you shake it again you might get the teddys back in
that wouldn't do would it
well you need to hold it like this more pet
a bit more in the baskets
not yet
in a little while you can play with anna's toys
oh yes
do you want me to look after percy
okay
oh i've found the driver for your tractor
whoops
oh i've just spilt the baby tiger's water
there he is
shall we try and find the trailer for the tractor
here it is
who shall we put in the trailer
look who mummy's found
another baby tiger
two baby tigers
that one's still having a swim i think
look who mummy's found
baby polar bear

is that to stop them from escaping
shall we put you could put the polar bear in the wheelbarrow
how much
how much money
has he bought the baby polar bear off the lady with the wheelbarrow
i know
yeah
yeah
why not
i'm sure polar bears can ride in cars
is that man looking after the polar bear to make sure he doesn't escape
he's having a sip is he
what's what is it he's drinking
is it water or milk
cold water
yes
that's what baby tigers drink isn't it
cold water
don't drive too fast
that baby polar bear might get sick
where are they taking him
oh
what's he going to do at the park
he's going to what in the mud and the water
oh
that'll be nice
because polar bears like playing in water
so do tigers
they like water as well
they're good swimmers
who's the lady got in her wheelbarrow now
who's in her wheelbarrow
why is he in the wheelbarrow do you think
can you remember how to mend it
can you remember how to mend it
you have to make sure the legs are down and the arms are out
and then you go
hold the hands still and then go pop pop
there you are
oh we've got a man pushing the wheelbarrow now
he can push the old lady
he's off i she
where's he off to
yeah
the thing is warren
this trailer doesn't fit on that car
because they're a different kind of tractor
a different kind of vehicle
that trailer fits on that car
yeah

can you open the lid now
oh yes
is henry going to have a cup of tea

people get out here
oh
now he's fallen down a pit
that's better
oh
well hello there
where's warren
well you tell me what's happening
where's thomas
he's going over well it's like a viaduct i think you call it
going over a big cutting
there's the main railway line
thomas is puffing along his branch
who has thomas got with him
clarabel and
that's right
gosh
you're better at reading than i am
no
that is annie and that's clarabel
those little white squiggles says their names
annie and clarabel
what number's on thomas
no
one
percy has a three
now the school bus has broken down
so thomas is going to pick up the children at the station
where's thomas now
on the line
and where's the line at the moment
is it going over a bridge
is it
it looks to me as if he's at the station
yeah
what's he doing
is he driving
that's right
oh
who's that waiting to take the children home
is bertie a nice bus
is bertie thomas's friend
who's the naughty bus
yeah
what does bulgie do
is bulgie up the mountain
and what happens to him in the end
he is isn't he
he's stuck right under the bridge
and bulgie's a mean scarlet deceiver
here's thomas at the station again picking up his passengers
oh look
where is he now
yes
it's a different bridge isn't it
yeah
it is
it's you can see the mountain through the tunnel
and that's a big water wheel
there's a mill here for grounding corn to make flour
and water comes onto this wheel
the wheel turns and that's what makes the
that's what makes the corn grind
oh what's happening to thomas here
he's coming off the rails
right
so who's going to help thomas taking his passengers
yeah because bertie's a nice bus isn't he
who's just over there
is he
is bulgie hiding
why is bulgie hiding
oh right
bulgie turns into a hen house doesn't he
he's got stuck under the bridge
oh who are these
who are these
what are they
yeah
they're the trucks that sing pop goes the diesel
is thomas happy
why is he cross
is she sleeping
why don't you wake her up
wake up dolly
well wake her up then
sit her up and she might open her eyes when you growl like a lion
good
oh she's asleep again
well shall i take the things out
see if we can find it
no
that's not your baby tiger
that's anna's baby tiger
your baby tiger doesn't sit on a little bit of green grass
where anna's baby tiger does
oh
look what i can see
who is he
is he
what color clothes is he wearing
what color clothes is he wearing
that's true actually
our postman does wear red and blue like this doesn't he
well it's red and yellow so you're half right
what are you doing to the panda
i'm not surprised
you've just spun his head right round
poor panda
i think you ought to give him a hug and a kiss and say you're sorry first
probably break his legs putting him in that way
putting him in backwards
he needs to go in like that
poor panda
can you dins the train song
warren sing the train song
no
warren sing it
warren sing it please
which train song
i don't know a horse song
you'll have to teach it to me
she is isn't she
perhaps you should wake her up
a bull
yes
it is a bull
here's another bull i think
yes
it's another bull
yeah
that is a horse
what color is it
i think it's brown and black and white actually
there we are
worth a try
well that's a funny looking train
poor elephant gets steam and smoke up his nose
up his trunk
that's it
what is that one
what is it
it's not a toothbrush
it's a cow
i don't know
where is he
don't forget that bit
anna's brought all these nice toys and you just want to read bertie and the bumpy line
oh well
no accounting for taste is there
why doesn't warren read it
who are his coaches
annie and clarabel
and who's waiting to take the children home
yeah
what kind of bus is bertie
he is called bertie
what are you called
oh
let me just attack your nose with this tissue
have you caught mummy's cold
that is truly horrible
ugh
ugh
just don't sneeze all over me
where's thomas now
where is he
yeah
oh
well i'm not starting right from the beginning again
right
is thomas sad
well i didn't really have chance to read it the first time because you turned the pages so quickly
okay
where's bertie
buss go on roads don't they
where do trains go
on what
tracks
that's it
or on rails
it's the same thing
tracks and rails are the same thing
and here's thomas going along with his passengers
oh dear
he's derailed
off the line
oh no
off the rails
off the tracks
so bertie takes his passengers while the tracks are being mended
bertie's carrying passengers along
thomas is sad
he thinks passengers will like bertie better than him and the trucks think that's funny because they're nasty trucks aren't they
he's just called truck
he doesn't have a name
trucks don't have names because there are too many of them and they are not nice
trucks aren't nice things apparently
have they got happy smily faces
has warren got a happy smily face
what color is it
it is just pink
you're right
i just need to get another tissue
what else can you find in the box
are you going to put this trailer on the back as well
what've you got there
oh ah thank you
we don't want water all over the floor
well there's nothing to look at
you look at the teddys
no
you can see the water perfectly well with the teddys in it
you look at the teddys and the baskets
i shall take it off you and put it on a high shelf
you mustn't pull that off
no
no
there's nothing to look at that's interesting
you realize something warren
you've put this on back to front
the light is shining back into the cab
you need the light at the front of the train
if you look at thomas and henry the funnel is at the front of the train and the dome is towards the back
look
here's henry
look warren
there's his funnel and there's his dome
there's the funnel and there's the dome
they're the wrong way round
you don't really need to get your trucks out because look
you've got two trucks here with the train
whoops
well i'll play with this train then
there are strange animals on this train aren't there
well you make a tower then pet
oh dear
that's falling over a bit isn't it
oh yes
well i never
where are the other men
how many men have you got
how many
yes
there is another one isn't there somewhere
because there are three men
no
i don't think we need to tip it all out
oh
found the monkey
i can't find the other man though
ahhah
no
i think that's all the men there are
i don't know where the baby tiger's gone
is he over here
where
just where on the box
look at all these animals in here
are they jumping about
look at that
three men on bricks
if you got this long brick you could put all three men on the same brick
one two three
how many men
how many men
good boy
one two
three
three men on a brick
is he having a rest there
gosh
they're boinging very fast
the one in the middle isn't stuck on properly sweetheart
that's it
how many men
good boy
are they all boinging together
my goodness
oh you've left one behind
look at all those animals on that train
what's the horse going to do
is it going to stand on the brick with the men
or is the man going to ride the horse
is he on
can you sing the horse song
oh dear
the cab's fallen off
that's a bit of a disaster isn't it
it's probably the monkey and the whale
who's going to drive the engine then
the giraffe's driving it
what a clever giraffe
will the giraffe drive very fast or very slow
what're you looking for
a wheel
a wheel which broke
who broke it
a wheel or a whale
i don't think you've broken any wheels recently
yeah
aren't you a lucky boy
not everybody gets to play with anna's toys
oh that's good
it's probably safer with a man driving rather than a giraffe isn't it
who's on that truck with the giraffe
yeah
are the giraffe and penguin friends
who's the elephant's friend
yeah
who's the elephant's friend or doesn't he have any
is the train whistle blowing
what kind of noise does it make
oy
that's my foot
oh is he asleep
gosh
that's a speedy old train
oh dear
like henry and the flying kipper
he's been derailed
because he was going too fast and missed all the points
there you go
that's mended the train
oh dear oh dear
yeah
it bumped on my toe as well
what're you looking for
the men
the men are over there by thomas bertie and the bumpy line and the horse
the men are over there by the book warren
by the book
this is gross
have you got a horrible nose
blow down your nose
that's better isn't it
yuck
yes
i think that's going straight in the bin
the sooner you learn to blow your nose the better mate
no
where are you going to put that
i think it's a bit big for you to carry pet
it's a bit heavy
you just banged your little toe did you
well that's your fault for trying to lift up cement mixers
shall i put it on its wheels
now where are you where did you want to put it
on your knees
well i'm sure you can lift it onto your knees
there you go
is it nice
oh
it's gonna going to fall over
or have you got it with your toes
you've got your little toes up haven't you to stop it from falling
no pet
you can see daddy later
see daddy later
no
you've got to come back because mummy's playing with you sweetheart
you come back in here
oh
well i'm sorry pet but you can't have him
shall we cut some animals
shall we make some animals
whoo
what color
blue pink or yellow
pink
okay
right we'll make some animals then
okay
it goes onto the little mat doesn't it
so it doesn't go on the carpet
right
are you going to roll it out
it's a bit hard
we're gonna going to have to get some more
perhaps mummy can make some
shall i roll it out
it's ever so hard to roll
oh crikey
it's hard
well it will be if i can get this rolled out
crumbs
it's even worse than the other colors
they were bad enough
has mummy rolled it big enough yet
is it big enough
no
because it's too tough
i think it might be big enough now
right
no
you've got it upside down sweetheart
you need the sharp edge
that's it
it's even hard it cut through as well isn't it
i think we might try one of the other colors actually
i think the pink is a bit too hard
why don't you put it in the pot
there we go
where are you going to put the plane
they're the propellers aren't they
the propellers
what kind of aeroplane is it
is it an aeroplane carrying people
want to make this person
if we get some more out and then we can make the person
that's supposed to be granny isn't it
shall mummy add this to here
and mummy'll squash it all together and then we can make granny
not that she looks like either of your grandmothers does she
right
let's get this squashed
it gets better as it gets warmer
whoops
just a sec

because it's some old play
why don't you try rolling it now i've flattened it a bit
because at least you can

it is too hard for warren isn't it

shall mummy hold it while you prod with your finger or do you want to use the prodding stick
watch it
you'll get your finger stuck in there
there we go

it's a shed where baby jesus was born
i know you think it's a garage but it's not
what're you doing
that's a good idea isn't it
right
just let mummy put the box like that
what a clever boy
are you going to tip some more into the box
don't put the baby tiger in
brilliant
it's probably easier to just put it straight in the box but not as much fun is it
right
let's get the box lined up shall we
would you like to drive a tipper truck when you're grown up
now is there any more of your tea set that needs to go in the box
can you put the rest of your tea set away please
why don't you put the other knife and saucer in
oh there's another knife there as well
a blue knife
um i'm not sure that's a good idea
it's supposed to be able to withstand an elephant standing on it so it might be able to cope with you
well you won't willn't be able to go anywhere on it
you can sit on it i suppose
well the thing is you see you might fall off it and hurt yourself
or you might fall backwards into this and get your bottom wedged in the dumper truck in the dumper bit
and then you wouldn't be able to move
you'd have to spend the rest of your life with a dumper truck wedged round your bottom
and then you'd look silly
well yes
you have to put the rubble in before you can tip it out though don't you
it doesn't really look like rubble to me
that looks more like a minicar
shall i put this away
gosh
that dumper truck's acting like a snowplow isn't it
why
well don't
no
don't drive over things with your dumper truck because that how things get broken
i know your tea set's only plastic but that's beside the point
very gentle
the thing is you can't scoop with the dumper truck can you
you can only dump things with it
you could always
your digger might be able to scoop
well your digger's up there
why don't you try scooping with your digger
on the top box
no
your digger's not in that box
your digger's not in the vehicle box
it's in the big box
there it is
whoops
you've been picking your labels off these haven't you
oh you've scooped up a cup
where are you going to put it
okay
and where's the garage
that's it
i'm not sure whether that'll be very good at picking up big things
that's good for little things
why don't you try putting some more cutlery in as well
perhaps a couple of spoons as well the fork
you've destroyed the train
now is that supposed to go up there warren
now if you remember the funnel goes in front of the dome
goes like that
what else is in the box
that's a pretty dress she's wearing isn't it
you have to undo her dress don't you if you want to change her
undo it at the back
then you can take the dress off and you can choose some other clothes for her to wear
it's like pulling you nappie
that's it
no
that one doesn't pull
it just pulls off now
if you unthread her arms
no
other way
when you unthread arms it comes down over the hand doesn't it
like that
okay
there's one
now do the other one
yeah now you pull it down over her hand
that way
that way
that's it
now she has to step out of it
that's it
pull it down
that's it
now what's she going to wear
okay
can you thread her arms into it
you don't know
right
well here are her arms
now then look
these are the arm holes here
one here
and one here
can you thread her arms into those arm holes
there's one
can you do the other one
it helps if you start from the inside and go out
there we go
now can you fasten her up at the back
that one goes like that
and that one goes over there like that
that's it
that goes over there like that
she's got tangled hair hasn't she warren
trousers
i don't think oh she has got trousers hasn't she
do you like this dress
is it a nice one
oy
ahhah
i wondered what that was
i thought it was a bit of a box but it's a turntable
wow
oh
well what do you call a trailer on a train warren
you don't really call it a trailer do you
what do you call it
you call it a truck if it's on a train
don't kneel on my shins child
i wonder why that penguin won't willn't stand up
that's it
hooray
what other things are going to stand up in your truck
what's the giraffe called
jolly
is that after jolly tall
the giraffe
right
he's a jolly tall giraffe
that's a good idea
gosh
there's a tower as well a penguin on there
my goodness
is it
what's in the tanker
oh
oh my
where did you see smoke yesterday
it was a chimney
because houses don't have funnels
houses have chimneys
and you looked down and you saw smoke didn't you
what else did you see yesterday
you went on the train last week yes
on sunday you went on the train didn't you
it wasn't really a special train
wasn't a train like this one though was it
was it it was an electric train wasn't it that you went on
i think the elephant would fit in
there
which man
which man
there are lots of men
can't see any though
ahhah
whoops
oh now i've destroyed the train
is he going to sit on the elephant
you can make what you like darling one
are you putting a fence round the field so things can't escape
that's the cow
that's the cow's udder
that's where you get milk from
no
she won't willn't stick on but she can stand in the field when you've put the fence round it can't she
in fact you could stand her in already
i'm sure she won't willn't run away because she looks like a very good well behaved cow
yeah
you want mummy to make a field
so what do you have to say
well i think you'd better keep your baby tigers away from here because your baby tigers might get mixed up with anna's baby tigers mightn't they
you put your baby tigers on here and they can watch
no well if they get put in the box by mistake
let's make the field then shall we
shall we make it a nice big field so the animals have got lots of space
shall we make the fence a bit higher
yeah
there's a slight problem with this field that mummy's made
do you know what that is
you can't actually get out of it
let's have some of these
we could have a little gate here couldn't we
look
there's a gate so the animals can get out
yeah
if we put that in front we can move that can't we when the animals want to get out
so we've got a cow in the field
what else shall we have in the field
have another cow
how many cows have we got now
that's right
what other animals shall we
shall we put in a horse
how many animals now
no
how many animals all together
no
count them
that's right
three animals
let's put another one in
let's put that bull in
how many animals are there now
you put your baby tiger in if you like
all these animals
my goodness
lots aren't there
i'm sure it feels safe having baby tigers in with the horses and cows
shall we put let's put the monkey on the side
what's he doing that monkey
oh that's nice
do you like hugging monkeys
looks as if the baby tiger's licking him doesn't it
that's what it looks like
the baby tiger doing
is he licking
no
no
good
would you like to be licked by a baby tiger
no
i wouldn't either
well which cream are you going to put on
that's not cream pet
who are you telephoning
who are you telephoning
well you'd better talk to them then
pull the aerial up and talk to them
that's it
they're on now
i can hear them
they're saying hello
say hello
oh
don't keep your finger on it
it's a horrible noise
was it
sounded more like somebody testing the power on their mobile phone to me
but there we go
well you see that has to go there so that if the animals want to come out of the field you can just open it up
and they can come out
and then you can close it again to make sure the other animals don't escape
and they are all standing here looking over
because they want to come out too
oh they're fall they've gone to sleep i think
what've they been drinking
oh no
they're escaping
where are they going
going to hospital
why
what're they going to have done at the hospital
they're going to have lunch at the hospital
that's a good idea isn't it
i expect hospitals do lovely lunches
i've never seen such a thing
have they got to hospital yet
no
anna's baby tiger doesn't come off the green bit
see your baby tigers look like anna's
except anna's is sitting on a bit of grass and yours isn't
no
that won't willn't come off sweetheart
no
it's not supposed to come off i don't think
no
it's not supposed to come off
they're just different kinds of baby tigers
oh poor baby tiger
i don't think it's the baby tiger that's being naughty
warren
bring those baby tigers back please
where are you taking them
no
warren
warren
come back
no
you put you come and bring the baby tigers back
there you go
i think if anna's baby tiger has been naughty you'd better put it back in the box
and if it's your baby tiger that's been naughty you'd better put it back in your box

another engine
my goodness
that won't willn't couple up will it
we'll have to turn all these round
one two three
look at this long train
oh it's hard work going over the bridge
chuff
just stopped in time didn't he
it's not that silly ambulance again is it
what i don't know what the ambulance driver's thinking of
oh yeah
well fine
it's a better place to park than where he was parked before isn't it
where's the ambulance off to
is it going to malta
that's a long way for an ambulance to go
beep
chuff
just stopped in time
it pushed the ambulance away didn't it
that ambulance driver's crazy
henry wants to go on
hooray
oh no
nee
out comes the crane
try and lift things back up
not a very good crane is it
poor old henry
derailed for the second time in a morning
that's right
there shouldn't be a monkey in there should there because monkeys don't drive trains
yeah well women can drive trains as well
what're you doing
never mind
it goes back on
what's coming
there's another truck behind you warren
look behind you
look right behind you
because there's the other truck there
no
behind you
next to the chair
there we go
well the thing is the monkey doesn't sit on things like that
he kind of stands on it
if you move his arms up a little bit
one
the other one
now you stand his feet on here
his feet on here
like that
because i don't think he sits down on things
he might sit on the funnel
a bit of a hot seat i think you'd call it
oh
not a good fit
shall we stand him on here again or on the cab roof
he normally stands up rather than sits down
that's the funnel
yeah
that's going to be a very tall truck
look at all those bricks
i hope that doesn't go through a low tunnel
great scott
there's a horse on it
i hope that horse doesn't mind heights
the ambulance is in your vehicle box
which is next to the blue box
warren
that's a horrible noise
is the horse all right up there
he's not scared is he
warren
warren
is the horse all right up there
he's not scared
because you know how jolly tall gets scared when he goes up high doesn't he
i'm glad the horse is okay
yeah
making a fence here
oh good
that's a rather strange place for a bit of fencing but never mind
we need the gates don't we
if i put that there then we can have the gate there
right
let's build the fence a bit higher
put a cow in there
but i might have wanted that field for horses or chickens
where are the chickens
i'd like some chickens in my field please
can you find me some chickens
now what's happened here
why are these cows sticking together
that's it
oh yes
there
is that wall high enough round the field
oh here's a cow coming in
moo
close the gate so they can't run away
oh no
there's a savage tiger creeping up
and the savage tiger's going to climb over the wall
grr
i don't think we'd want to close the tiger in really but never mind
along comes super pig
flys in
sits on the tiger's back and the tiger turns into a tame animal and goes to sleep
there's super pig
are they all asleep now
we haven't really got anything to use as a blanket unless unless we use the doll's dress or blouse
could do
we could line them all up
shall we cover them up
tuck them up under the blanket
there we go
have they woken up now
are they waking up
oh no
are they escaping
shall the panda try and round them up
back tiger
back
oh no
the tiger's tangled up
get in there tiger
come on cow
he's looking over making sure they don't try to escape again
there we are
who is
oh poor panda
you give him a cuddle then
make him feel better
no
i don't think the car would fit into the field sweet
gate shut
animals can't escape
except for the tiger who can jump very high
oh no
the bull's out
going on the rampage
is the pig sleeping
well the cow and the bull might fit in this way
if we pop the bull in next to the cow like this
quick
get the gate on
stop that tiger from escaping
where's the car going to go if it can't go in the field
where've they been in the car
malta
that was a long drive
yeah
the car won't willn't fit will it
even if it knocked the gate down it couldn't fit in because its wheels are too wide
unless it climbed over the top of the wall
i don't i don't think it can
i didn't realize that was an ambulance
i thought it was an ordinary car
or is it because it's the panda's car
no
the car won't willn't fit
the car's too wide
oh no
it's not going to drive over the wall is it
but there's no driver
no
it hasn't got a driver in
who's going to drive it
i don't know warren
we're both yawning
we need early nights tonight
who might put warren to bed tonight
yeah
would you like paul to bath you and put you to bed
oh
would you like tom to
sue
mummy
well those are the only people that can bath you and put you to bed tonight because daddy's going away
so i think it'd be nice if paul did
paul came and saw you the other night didn't he
when you'd just gone you were just having your story
they are aren't they
that lion that tiger's going to run away very fast
where is it
where's the tiger gone
grr
running away
grr
he's going to bite your nose
oh
shall it kiss your nose
lick your cheek
lick lick lick
oh no
you've got a tiger on your knee
oh
no
you haven't
you've knocked it off
oh he's sleeping on your knee
oh that's nice
he's a nice stripy tiger isn't he
don't move about too much if you're sleeping
oh he's awake
i don't think that
oh
i think the car's wedged now
don't you
a wedged car
oh yes
thing is warren
that car cheated
it flew
cars don't normally fly
cars don't fly
if the car's in the field where are all the animals going to go
no space for them really is there
i think that car ought to come out and let the animals in
that's better
because fields are for animals
not for cars
those poor animals
got no field
sounds a good idea
oh that's nice
are you having a rest
you are having a rest aren't you
can they creep past the car into the bit of field
oh the car's coming out
i think these animals are going to go scampering in very fast
and shut the gate so the car can't come in
right
the tiger's going to come and frighten the car away
grr
a
brumm
but the car is sneaky
going to come creeping back and try and sneak in over the wall here
but the tiger's noticed and it's going to come and frighten it away again
grr
a
warren
do you need your pottie
warren
stand up
are you sure
and you don't need anything else
oh
oh yes
yes
you must always shut gates when you've been through them mustn't you
to stop creatures from escaping
oh that was a big jump wasn't it
that gate is open and shut an awful lot isn't it
well who's going to join the cow and the bull and the baby horse and the pig
that's another bull
a black bull
oh yes
no
it's a brown and white bull
i think
well i don't think you need to tip it all out
i don't think that's a good idea
come here
warren
just come here
do you need a poo
are you sure
oh where are all those bricks
oh they're hidden underneath the box
oh yes
oh here's here's the mummy
is baby tiger going to have a ride on his mummy's back
baby tiger will fit on you know
there
like that
looks a bit funny though doesn't it
the giraffe's got into the field
that's it
what happens if you leave the gate open
creatures can get in or out can't they
who's going in there
oh
are they all running away
yeah
noone in there
what's coming in
what's coming in
tram
good job it's got a cow
it can push its way through all those bricks
they're both yellow cars aren't they
have you got any more yellow vehicles you can get out
here's your yellow van
and the yellow beach buggy
and a yellow bus
and the yellow beach buggy trailer
all these yellow vehicles
and what's this
what's this coming up
and what color is it
blue
are you sure
no
it's yellow
i think that's all the yellow vehicles that we've got
yeah but the tractor's not yellow
never mind
you can have an orange tractor
get some red vehicles out now
the red fire
red train
another red fire
i've just thought of another yellow vehicle but i can't see it
look at all these vehicles parked
have they stopped at the traffic lights
right
well they'd better move off then otherwise people start going beep
in fact here comes the fire
wanting them to move
he's beeping his horn
they'd better start moving off hasn't they
no
you keep the door closed
keep the door closed
oh right
shall i move out of the way
i'm not in the way of all your vehicles
are you making a long line
no
they can't
because that's really a baby toy
that's right
can you remember what peter rabbit's sisters are called
what the other little rabbits are called
they're flopsy mopsy and cottontail aren't they
there's a little rabbit somewhere that sits on that rabbit's back
let's have a look for it
should be in here somewhere with all the other animals and vehicles
can't see it
a
there it is
little rabbit
fits on the big rabbit
has it
where did it go on the aeroplane
a
well it's called a beach buggy
it's a special vehicle that drives on the sand
because you've got the little trailer
and there's a boat somewhere that goes on the trailer
because if you have a boat at he seaside you need to have a special vehicle that can pull it down so it can get into the sea
do you remember seeing them when we were with the girls in kent
i don't know where the little boat is
probably in the bath
another red stop
oh the vehicles shouldn't really bump at red lights
if you keep on bumping like that the police car will come
it's a tape recorder
it is anna's yes
what color is it
oh that police car will come with his
oh here's the boat that goes on the beach buggy
like that
and it drives down to the sea
don't keep bashing
the police car will come
at the moment i don't think it'll have a policeman in it
no
it hasn't has it
here comes the police car
nee
coming to see what's happening
yes
police cars don't bump other vehicles
you tell me
who is it
what's the big rabbit called
and what's the little rabbit called
oh it's just called rabbit is it
is it little rabbit
have they
are they
where are where are the missing rabbits
on the kitchen door
i don't think so
mummy doesn't have rabbits there
yeah
well how many wheels has he got altogether
he's got two at the front and two at the back but how many are there altogether
because all these wheels
how many are there
that's it
because there's two at the front and two at the back
they're creaky wheels aren't they
that's a good place for him isn't it
well yeah
i would have thought it was a tractor rather than a digger
because diggers normally have scoops don't they
that's right
that's the spare wheel isn't it
in case one of the other wheels gets broken
that's right
would you like to have a little swim in the sea
would you
maybe we can arrange it when we go on holiday
i bet you won't willn't like it
you wouldn't go in last time we went to the sea
it wasn't cold
well a bit chilly
you wouldn't even put your toes in would you
do you remember
the water came up and you ran away screaming
it's a very long line of vehicles isn't it
are you
next time what
where are you going on the bus
where are you going on the bus
get your hand out of your trousers
oh we've got
two lines of traffic
haven't we
we've got vehicles going in one direction and some more going in another
pardon
all these cars
what about the breakdown
you have got a crane
it's not as big as old bear's crane though is it
he has
what does he do with it
yeah and what happens
and then what happens
yes
because jolly doesn't like going up high does he
when little bear takes his paw off jolly's eyes jolly starts to wobble
that's right
and where does little bear go
no
he flys across the room and lands on the
yes
how does he get down
well sort of
little bear slides down jolly's neck doesn't he
yeah
that's the car that used to have the caravan attached isn't it
the caravan's broken now
no
i don't know where the caravan is
it's not in here
well it's not in here anyway
what are you after
which one
i wonder where your purple beetle car is
never mind
you've got your red one haven't you
oh yes
what's that wheel for
yes
what's it doing in the bonnet
it's the spare wheel in case one of the other wheels gets broken
do you remember when we saw that man putting a new wheel on his car
one of his wheels had broken and he had to put his spare wheel on
mummy and daddy have got a spare wheel in their car but it's in the boot
not in the bonnet
because beetle are special cars because their engines are at the back
yes they are aren't they
yeah
the back wheels are stuck though
what we need
well we do need a screwdriver so we can take the bottom plate off
maybe mummy'll have a go at mending it later
no
not really
the wheels are are broken
that's right
engines are normally in bonnets
you see beetle are unusual because they have their engine at the back in the boot
well spare wheels can go in bonnets yes
some
or they can go in boots
or they can go on the back of vehicles like the land rover
ow
why
i think you would say ow if a dumper truck drove over your toes
wouldn't you
yes well
they are not poorly
that's a very long line of vehicles
don't think it's big enough
i tell you what
let's get this little car out
i wonder if that little car would fit underneath
yes
let's see if i can find any more little cars
little vehicles
there's a little vehicle
we haven't got many small vehicles really
oh dear
shall the ambulance come
see if everyone's all right
nee
whoops
now that's crashed into the land rover
i think the land rover's probably all right
silly
that's right
where've you picked that one up
who's taught you that warren
charlie did he
right
it's all coming out now
oh
i shall have words with his mother i think
i suppose it could have been worse
you want another little one
we haven't got many small vehicles you see
oh that might fit under
oh here's a small one
well here's the taxi
the taxi will fit
oh
oh i thought you meant fit under the rabbit
i don't think anything actually fixes on to the back of the breakdown truck
pass me the breakdown truck
pass it over
let me look
let's see
well it might do
if you hook it over the little thing there
the problem is it won't willn't turn corners then
i don't think it will
i think that's very optimistic
bash it back
no
let's push it back gently
it's reversing back
now the little beetle car's coming through
brumm
turning round
going back under
oh no
they're all pushing each other
it has broken hasn't it
why don't you mend it
oh
it has come off hasn't it
won't willn't fit in a line
you'll have to move that sports car
then you can put a sports car at the back
it won't willn't fit sweetheart
not unless you move the other vehicles backwards
that's it
look at all these vehicles
oh no
we don't want to play the music
mummy was just moving it out of the way
you play with your vehicles instead
i'll put he music in there for later
yeah
that's a little car against the bus isn't it
pardon
that's it
oh is it
oh dear
this is very annoying isn't it just moving forwards a little way
and having to stop again
there you go
there we go
oh i see
that cheeky engine's pushed in has he
turned in from a side road
i don't think he knows where he's going does he
well i think harry fixed that one actually
it wasn't granddad
harry did fix it because it had stopped working so it couldn't make the horrible noise and harry fixed it so it would work
so now it makes the horrible noise again
that's why we've not sent harry a birthday present
no
i don't think they can
the doors on here open though don't they
on the land rover
let's just have a look at this
oh the doors don't open
i wonder how he gets in and out
what do you mean no
oh he stays in
this one's much makes a much better noise
much more gentle isn't it
he's going to reverse back
he did didn't he
it's not really an amusing thing warren cars bumping each other
oh my
well no
oh dear
that's a horrible accident isn't it
does the ambulance need to go and see if anybody's hurt
see if anyone's poorly
nee
a what tower
oh
that's a very big tower isn't it
that makes a good noise doesn't it
well you move it backwards and forwards and you'll see it coming back
where's the monkey
i can see the monkey
remember the monkey always bends forwards doesn't he
is he
that's a good idea
who's driving the car
oh no
the tower's gone
what other animals can you find in here
oh yes
well if it's attached to a train sweetheart you call it a truck
are you making that tower even bigger
what're you looking for
did you
never mind
why don't you find another small one to put in the other side
yes
i know it's bigger
oh
the problem is sweetheart you've got a funny shaped one on there haven't you
why don't you take that funny shaped one off
the tower's gonna going to fall over in a minute anyway
oh
it is a bit like a h for harry
are you taking all the pieces apart
ah
you're making a wall or something
is it a wall
just a road
okay
right
where's the roundabout
what do you have to do when you go round a roundabout
while you're going round you have your indicator on don't you
to say where you're going
we went on the motorway yesterday didn't we
we went on the motorway last week to grandma's house
we went on the motorway yesterday to sainsbury's
not quite as exciting
look at all those different colors
two green ones
another green one
can you find another yellow one to put on there
what color's that
that's right
that's another blue one
is that the right color
looks red to me
peep
you'd better move the brick then
peep
who's going to move the bricks
warren
thank you
you've got lots of bricks on there haven't you
you've got a tall tower
a medium tower and a small one
what color are you looking for now
a red one
do you not want one on top of h for harry
oh
okay
no
he can't go on your little tower
they get in the way don't they
shall we put some animals on your towers
let's find some animals
what's that
yeah
what is it though
is it a big tiger or a little tiger
yeah he is
he's the baby tiger isn't he
here's a horse and a dolphin
whoops
shall we put the big put the whale on
you wait here
you carry on playing with the toys sweetheart
i'll just see who's at the door
warren
shall we stay here
yeah
nana and granddad have just come haven't they
they're waiting until anna's gone and then no doubt scrounge a cup of tea
granddad does normally sit on this chair doesn't he
yeah
i just hope i've not left the dining room in a complete tip
probably have
oh
i only vacuumed the hall and the sitting room this morning didn't i
i wasn't expecting visitors
yeah
you get all this finished
what else are you going to put up
oh
shall we put a penguin up
where shall we put the penguin
put him here
or her
it
oh
i'll just go and tell them they can make a cup of tea
oh can you see them
oh i can see one
that's right
where are the others
there should be two more
what're you looking for
the two men
the other two men
where are they
ah
there's one
where's the other one
a
how many now
rubbish
rubbish
even more rubbish
rubbish warren
i should be encouraging you positively
just talking rubbish
are they yours
i suppose they're yours
they are anna's yes
are they
what are they talking about
are they talking about the weather
or shopping
what're they talking about
are they talking about all the animals they can see
what can you hear
i've no idea where it is
it was a bee or a wasp or a fly or something
well no
it wasn't a butterfly because butterflys don't make buzzy noises
butterflys are very quiet
it might have been a fly
it might even if it was a bee it might have been outside
because bees sometimes buzz so loud that you can hear them through the window if they're very close
it might have been that wasp that we saw the other day in the bed
it escaped
very beautiful
wobble wobble
wobble wobble
poor mummy
oh dear oh dear
you did
hope there's nothing breakable in there
okay
do you want to get those out quickly
shall mummy put the bricks away
shall we leave them out for the while
leave them out for the minute
is this my hat
mummy's hat
or is it warren's hat
shall warren put it on
you sometimes need a hard hat to go shopping
no
it's not daddy
it's nana and granddad making cups of tea i think
can you find some eggs in the basket
do you want to put them in the box
put them in the egg box
yes
it's a little egg isn't it
yes
mummy had to buy big eggs yesterday didn't she to make that pudding
oh
i can see another one
is that a big egg or a little egg
yeah
shall we see if we can find any more big eggs or little eggs
is that an egg
oh yes
so it is
is it nice
is your ice nice
the basket out
okay
oh
what's that left in there
oh dear
never mind
how many eggs are there
good
okay
where are the other ones going
right
shall we put the lid on the box
stop them from rattling about
there we go
and we can put the eggs in the basket
to the bank
can i have some money please
to pay for the shopping
thank you
how much did you give me
oh thank you
an orange
and some eggs
no
you mustn't break eggs
not unless you're cooking with them
even then you have to be very careful about how you break them
you have to bash them with a knife
oh don't break the eggs
it'll make a mess on the carpet
oh
well there did used there were lots more eggs at one point
some seem to have disappeared
i think somebody's been making omelettes with anna's eggs
okay
right
that's a good place isn't it
shall we put the lid on
stop them falling out
put them carefully in the basket
there we go
is it
it's all those cans of food you've got
have to do some of your own home cooking instead mate
oh nice refreshing ice
no
you take that out of your mouth
you're not really a baby anymore are you
why aren't you a baby
what do babys wear
babys wear nappies
and put things in their mouths
do you wear nappies
no
you don't
you'd like a cup
um shall we get a cup out of your tea set
you can pour the milk into it
but we must remember it's your cup and not anna's cup
she doesn't take it home with her
there we go
no
it just squirts out through a little hole in the lid
it's a special milk bottle
that's it
oh delicious
nice cool milk
is that nice
oh thank you
lovely
funny
you always like eating those chips warren but you won't willn't eat proper ones will you
you won't willn't eat proper chips
will you
take them out of your mouth
take them out of your mouth
you're not a baby
you're a big boy
you keep telling me
no
don't keep putting them in your mouth
just pretend
it's a tin of soup
you need a tin opener and we haven't got one
it is
that's cream of tomato soup
delicious
what's in this tin
cat yeah
what's in this tin
nothing
something you sometimes have with ice and balls
it's pears
are you singing
what a lovely song
oh no
don't break them
oh no
well that's a funny place for an egg
that's right
yes
okay
just close your eyes
keep them closed
keep them closed
keep them closed
open your eyes
open your eyes
what's in the egg box
what is there
are they all eggs
no
what's that
it's a strawberry
a tomato
and what's that yellow thing
what's this
it's a lemon
there you go
now shall we leave those things in the egg box
so that when anna gets these out at home to play with and she surprised
she'll open the egg box and she'll think oh i'll play with some eggs
and she'll open it and she'll say oh
but what are these doing in here
is that a good idea
shall we leave those in there
maybe some other children might be surprised as well when they see strange things in there
what's this doing in the fruit in the shopping basket
where should it be
oh here
i'm going to break up your other puzzles
i'm going to mix the pieces up
we've got two sets of puzzle pieces mixed up
are you going to mix that up with these as well and have three puzzles mixed up
right
now sort out those puzzles
don't chew it please
you did chew it one time
and i've never let you forget it
there we go
it is sad
why is the kitten sad
no
she's not being silly in the garden
she's shut in the shed
she can't get out
that's right
the cat's looking out
trying to find somebody to help her
is that the right piece there
does that piece go on that puzzle or does it go on another one
it does
i think that piece you put in before must be wrong
is that piece right
i don't think that one's right
i think that one goes in another puzzle
oh yes
so it does
so what bits do you need to look for for here
oh yes
oh yes
he's got two eyes now hasn't he
one eye on one piece and one eye on another piece
you've finished that one
you've only got two more puzzles to do
and you've done half of one of them
that one's finished isn't it
you tell me what color are they
you tell me
it is yellow
you're right
you tell me
rubbish
rubbish
it's orange
it is orange
you look at that
it's orange
an orange leaf
right
where did these other pieces go
oh bless you
bless you
if you do chew that again yes you will be a naughty boy
but you won't willn't chew it again because you're a big boy
you won't willn't chew it another time
well you can chew it another time but that puzzle will go away
i don't think that one goes there because the cat doesn't have two heads does it
does that make a good picture
no
do you remember what goes here near the cat's bottom
his feet
and what else is in that corner
rubbish
look at the picture
rubbish
look at the picture
his feet
what's underneath that blue bit of door
what's here
can you see with a brush on
you will won't willn't you
well you look for a piece that's got bricks of the wall on it
oh dear
actually that goes in the other one
or does it
maybe it does
well look for another piece with bricks on
can you see another piece with bricks on
that does go there
it does
look look look look
that does go there
so what needs to go here
now is that the right piece
does that look right
no
so that can't be right can it
oh dear
yeah
never mind
you've only got two more pieces to put on this puzzle haven't you
pardon

oh elephant

elephant
just come here
elephant
come here
now you listen to me
you don't normally squirt people with water in the house
okay
do it outside please
he'll do it outside in future so it doesn't matter if we get wet
okay
so i won't willn't do any more squirting
you naughty elephant
you promised
you promised me that you wouldn't do it again
the naughty elephant
well no
because it's a bit cold for elephants outside today
no more squirting
no more squirting

you don't need another tissue pet
borrow mummy's
i've got my own here
there
all dry now
you did didn't you
you were a good boy when you played with those in the car this time
not like the first time when you pulled the plug out of the bottom and the water came out
we had to screech to a halt didn't we then warren
with water pouring everywhere
how many teddys have you got in
you just need to get one more in don't you
who's poorly
why
oh
do you want a cuddle
why are you sad
oh
you bashed your head on those teddys
well that was a daft thing to do wasn't it
poor warren
oh
you want to go to bed
well you can't go to bed
it's not bed time
it's not bed time until you've had your lunch and your tea and your bath
and who's bathing warren tonight
and
who's going to lift warren out
daddy's not bathed you for ages has he
you haven't got a pocket in those trousers pet
no
you haven't got any pockets
on some of your other trousers yes you have got pockets
but you've got no pockets in those
okay
so it is
can you throw it to mummy
hooray
mummy throw it to warren
whee
that's the only kind of ball we can throw inside
one made out of tissue
throw it to mummy
oh
why don't we put it up your sleeve
and if you need it you've got a tissue there haven't you
and mummy can forget about it and put it through the washing machine
everything'll come out with white fluff on it
is that a good idea
oh
no
no kicking in the house
not even tissue balls
oh
oh
you're not very accurate
warren catch
it's not gonna going to get that far
oh mummy's a bad shot
you'll never be in the olympic team
whoops
never mind
just leave it
there
you put it back on there
that's it
yes
i caught it
hooray
you're very bouncy all of a sudden child
is it that bang on the head
no
don't bang mummy on the head
we don't want to bang warren on the head because you'll get a bit sad again won't willn't you
if you're going to bang my head deliberately with yours i'm not having you on my knee
that was silly
pardon
what's that funny whinie noise
you don't know
i think it a little whinie boy
a
what's the matter
what's the matter
what do you think
a tissue
we all fall down
stop it
no
don't you dare
if you bang my head again with yours you will be in trouble
yes you will
yes
yes
now that's far more sensible than banging mummy's head
i think that might fit in it
let's have a look
will it fit in
that's it
now you've got all these little gaps and i don't think there anything that'll fit in there
so we'll have to have those little gaps won't willn't we
we'll have to leave them
it is like a h for harry
actually i think that might fit on somewhere
let mummy have a can mummy have a try
try fitting in over there
no
over here
there
that fits doesn't it
what're you doing
you're taste
but little bear's porridge was just right

or have i got it wrong
oh yes
you sort those little corners out
well shall we put the

you've used your brain haven't you
excellent
you're missing lots of sky
that's right
crunch crunch crunch
when you eat carrots they're cooked aren't they
you don't like raw carrots particularly
you come back and blow on the carrots
to cool them off
what did you do with those carrots this morning at safeway
you picked them up and put them in the bag for mummy didn't you
you chose the carrots
well it was just two actually this time

that's only got fifteen pieces
this has got twenty five
shall we finish off the tractor puzzle first
yeah
yeah
we bought that in a shop while you were fast asleep in your push
it was very convenient
because we don't like going in that shop when you're awake because we have to spend ages in there with you
we can't just whip in and whip out
anyway let's finish off this one
now what's on that piece
a bit of lady and a bit of

look at the blobby sticky out bits
and the little holes that need to be filled
yes but we need to put the last two pieces of sky in first
put these last pieces of sky in first
warren
that's got two sticking out bits
and that's only got one hole so it can't go there
it has to go here
work out which way round it goes
that's it
yes
that's right
it's got one sticking out bit which fits into the hole
right
let's get these other pieces out now
well that's so that you can spread your pieces out
you think so
well why don't you look for the piece that's got a little bit of house on
can you see a piece with a little window on
a little bit of window from the house
remember last time
you put a piece in there and you said oh look
it's got a little bit of window on
can you see a piece with a little bit window on

where's the man
that's right
yes

you go and sit over there and rabbit might help
no
he wants to give you that one

you give him that one and you have that one
yeah
rabbit's not very accurate is he
he's tired
it's worn him out all this puzzling
no rabbit
you mustn't throw things
naughty rabbit

because this is going to be a very tall train at the moment
let's just sort it out
then we can have a tall train
look at that tall train
chuff
right
brumm
that's a very tall train isn't it
no
i think the car's on the track
that car had better move
brumm
crazy driver
i think that train driver's a crazy driver a well
don't you
oh dear
don't think so
no
going to make a tunnel
poop
oh no
there's been a train crash
is it
well panda cars
that's what you call police cars
the train's had a crash
he needs a kiss
oh naughty rabbit didn't put his hand in front of his mouth
that's it
that's a good boy
you're saying ouch
i think i'll get out of the train's way on this chair
don't like being run over by trains
that's a good idea
because a locomotive is very big isn't it
it's tall
you can have a tall tower on the back
is it tall enough now
that's a nice tower isn't it
very fancy shape
is it tall enough yet
it did didn't it
oh no
what a disaster
that's better
that's a stronger tower isn't it
you certainly are
oh
you did didn't you
oh right
i'm sorry
does warren not go crash
a
you've got only got one blue brick on your tower haven't you
right at the bottom
oh no
it's fallen off again
that wasn't entirely successful was it warren
shall i show you a good way to make it stronger
if you get this big brick
put it right across there
that'll help to make it stronger
and then the whole thing fell apart rather than just one brick
oh well
thing is warren
if you try pushing bits on the sticky out bits it will fall apart
if you stick them on the main bit of the tower
oh dear
pardon
you want to throw a tissue
no
you can't
hey ho
i don't know
you threw it mate
that's the problem with throwing things
you don't always know where they go
no
throw a piece again and they all go away and they go straight back in anna's car
yes
right
let's put them away then
oh
how strange
i thought you said i don't want these
are you building a fence
are the cows going in the field
where's the gate going to go
right
it's quite big
is it
if you say it's only little darling it's only little
that bit's sticking out isn't it
what color's the piece that's sticking out
what about the other piece that's sticking out
yeah
a
another tall tower
what do you think i'm doing
making what
making the car ridge
carriage do you mean
pardon
a bridge
well i wasn't going to make a bridge no
would you like me to make a bridge
this is special going to be a special bridge
yes well i don't and this is my bridge
no
it's not
it's my bridge actually
you can make a bridge yeah
no problem
i think the train could probably fit through it
you're right
you know what his bridge is called
it's called baby tiger bridge
there
will it fit
no
mummy'll just make the bridge a bit taller then
making the bridge taller
i noticed
why are you moving them
warren
warren
why are you moving all those bricks
so there's space for the baby tiger bridge
oh
what would you like
a banana bridge
shall we try and make it wide enough for the car
can you pass me the board that's got lots of big pieces on
can you pass me the flat board with big pieces on
here
the board with big pieces on
this one
right
make it wider so that the car will fit through shall we
making it wider so the car will fit through
this will make it a bit taller as well
what color pieces am i putting on now
oh hang on
oh dear
there we go
will that fit through now
whoops
oh no
one of the legs has fallen off
there we go
that's a very big bridge isn't it
who is
cars shouldn't really go on pavements should they
oh yes
two wheels on the pavement and two wheels on the road
where is it going to go
oh
is it pinching the car
brumm
brumm
hey
i thought we'd just said that cars shouldn't go on pavements really
oh yes
where's he going
a
what can he buy at the shops
what kind of food
pardon
oh we'd better be very quiet then hadn't we if he's asleep
wake him up
what was that waking him up
was it
it wasn't a very quiet lion
it was a very noisy lion
this bridge keeps getting taller
it's now a banana fish bridge look
is he
oh yes
a whole car's on the pavement
well that shouldn't be allowed should it
how many
three
that's right
are they on the pavement too
have to make sure that car doesn't bump into them
i don't think those men should move because cars shouldn't be on pavements
yes
bless you
bless you
send it back
send it back under the bridge
oh no
it's banged into the bridge
i'd like to see you aim him accurately at speed to the bridge sweetheart
oh no
he's on the pavement
now put a few little bumps in sweetheart so it's not terribly boring
okay
oh okay yeah
that's fine
it'll basically be a round one okay
go round in a square
well i'm not sure that's a good place if you want a round track
let's put it bending the other way
let's put it bending that way
right
i want a straight bit
is that all right
choo
right
if we move this over here a bit then you won't willn't have to climb over anna's feet
you shouldn't knock the bridge down says she destroying it in the process
there we go
shall we get some
i want a i'd like a truck on my train
would you like a truck on yours
would you like a shell oil truck
there you go
there's your truck
what's yellow
no that
oh well
that bit underneath is yellow but that bit you were just touching is red actually
that's yellow with red writing on
oh bump
my train's stuck onto yours now
do you think
brumm
it went under the warren bridge didn't it
oh you bumped into mine
never mind
ow
oh no
you bumped into it again
er you're in the middle of the track boy
oh no
i think my train's going to start sliding backwards
oh he can't get up the hill
oh no oh no
oh slid backwards just like what's his name
oh right
oh yes
but look who's coming
the powerful express called
bump
choo
oh henry's half derailed
you'll have to move
you're sitting on the track
oh dear
oh that's it
he's back on now
no
don't stand on the track sweetheart
you might break it
yes
only
you're quite right
you're quite right
even the driver doesn't normally stand on tracks does he
oh no
shall we have to get the crane
shall we go and get the crane to lift henry up
back on
yes
well you just wait there while i get the crane from out here
here it is
what has your what have your grandparents done to this crane
or what did you do to it
well i've never seen this bit coming out of here before
right
let's pick henry up shall we
shall we let down the hook
help to pick him up
pick up his tender first
okay
pick up his tender
put it back on
oh it's just rolled backwards
never mind
let's pick up henry
put him on
and he can go back slowly
and collect his tender
it's handy having a crane isn't it warren
hooray
oh
but look
there's a rhino on the line
what shall we do
shall we lift the rhino off with the crane
plonk
i said before it's handy
oh no
that rhino's back on again
how can we get him off
okay
you get him off
oh no
the rhino's back on again
what shall we do
pick him up with the crane
well i think the crane's quite a good idea
what are you going to do with the car
oh i don't know if that's big enough to move a rhino pet
no
that's too little really
well shall we move this rhino
it is isn't it
no
we don't want him going too fast do we
well i didn't know that trains could go on roads
i thought they needed tracks to work properly
had you better move that vehicle off the track
is the crane going to get rid of the vehicle
oh i thought you'd i was hoping you would see that
never mind
i didn't hide it well enough
well i think the first thing you need to do is get rid of that vehicle off the track
it's very dangerous having vehicles
that's better
it's very dangerous having vehicles on train tracks isn't it
shall we find some more animals to go in the middle
shall we find some more animals
look what i've found
a seal and a panda
and a polar bear
you can have this weebley genie
oh he doesn't weebley very well
no
we don't kick them
well one's a panda and one's a polar bear
i know they look virtually identical
the white one is a polar bear and the black and white one is a panda
that's right
and what's the other one
a polar bear
that's it
because it lives in polar regions
north pole in fact
no
polar regions
not pigeons
just realized warren
this weebley genie is a disney genie
oh you'd better move those bears
poop
oh
better had
you'd better move find some way of getting rid of those bears
how shall we move them
but how are we going to move the bears
don't run over that rhino
could cause damage to the vehicle
yeah
thank you
what shall i do with him now
i think a snoring teddy might wake him up
i think a quiet turkey might wake him up
i think a roaring lion
there he is
there you go
yeah
that's it
brilliant
he has
and he's got a very funny face
that little horn on the end of his nose
it is
and he's got a bit of a grumpy mouth
do you know anybody that looks like this warren
that's a relief
oh be careful of those bears
those poor bears
i know what we can do
we can send someone in to rescue them
i think he'll only fit on there backwards
that way round
well it doesn't really fit on at all
oh it does
maybe he does
whoops
i've lost a truck
good job henry's at the back pushing
good job those bears are off the track
are they
a that's nice
are they friends
oh
doesn't the polar bear like being kissed
oh
right
green go for the train
there is isn't there
and what are we going to do
shall the gorilla come and move the wall
what noise does a gorilla make
well kind of
i'm not sure actually what
come and watch the gorilla taking the wall down
big strong hand
oh
whoops
there it is
isn't he a kind gorilla
now he's standing on the track in the way
oh you want the wall
okay
it's your wall and your tunnel
you can do with it what you like
poor mummy
that's because you blew all the air out
you sat on me hard
well the driver had better drive very carefully then hadn't he
oh he's fallen off
i'm not sure you should go on fast roads when your polar bear not attached properly
that's better isn't it
oh yes
i don't think the gorilla's even seen the car has he
he's got his back to it
what's gonna going to happen next
oh what a surprise
now what's the gorilla going to do
okay
he's saying oy
who bumped my bottom
i think a level crossing might be a good idea for this
you could buy one with your pocket money couldn't you
so cars can drive over more easily
is it the end of the journey
it is
he's going to come and look in the tunnel
can you see him
you come round here and see if you can see the polar bear peeping over
come round this end
can you see him peeping
peeppo peekaboo
peeppo peekaboo
he's standing on top of the wall now
he's a very fit polar bear isn't he
he can do a lot climbing
oh
jumped onto henry's tender
i think he might fall when we go over the bridge
oh
poor bear
no
i think that's a safer way for him to travel
don't you
not very safe on the back of a train
what kind of a way to travel is that
yes
what number is henry
no
what number
count mummy's fingers and that's the number that henry is
that's it
henry's number three
and that number on his tender says three
what on earth is that warren
what's that noise
oh right
oh it's the car engine
reversing
that's what you call going backwards in a car isn't it
reversing

what's that somebody called
do you know
called people
you need to get the bricks dead central
there
shall we take it off the lid
that'll make it easier
move that lid there
that'll make it easier
because it wasn't a flat surface was it that lid for the train to stand on
just try it like that
that's it
because that's a big big piece big big brick isn't it
oh
that's it
that's it
look
you've got little bits sticking out at the sides
that looks nice doesn't it

well there's the car
that's a funny noise it makes going over there isn't it
who's sitting in the car

oh well perhaps he'd better get in the car if it's going to go under the bridge
there you go
whoops
there you did go
the bridge has just fallen down
not very good workmanship is it if it falls down before anyone's even gone through it
there you go
will he fit
oh just
he has to go right through the middle doesn't he otherwise his ears will catch on the bridge
oh warren
look at that plane
can you see it
where's the boat
there
right
so where shall i draw the breakdown
here
on the road
okay

okay
you draw the road then
okay
i'll draw the police car
shall i use this one for the police car
that one
what color is it
no
it's called yellow
the paper's white

who's been chewing the brown one
when you were a little boy wasn't it
right
what kind of vehicle shall i draw

that's a bendy road isn't it
just an ordinary car
okay
i'll do an ordinary car
one wheel
two wheels
exhaust fumes coming out of the exhaust pipe
there you go
door handle on
bumpers
there's an ordinary car
with smoke coming out of the exhaust
okay
there's daddy in the front
who's that in the back
what's warren doing in the back
what are you doing in the back of that car
are you just sitting there
and what's daddy doing
is he driving carefully
you want another
there's some more paper there underneath the lion
there
that's better
just the one sheet
okay
now you draw a picture for mummy
okay
well i think you can draw one all by yourself and then perhaps we can give it to nana and granddad
okay
so you draw a picture all by yourself
that's right
provided you draw them a beautiful picture all by yourself
what color is it
is it
or is it yellow
it is
a yellow one and a black one

yes
that's yellow
what color's that one
black
one black
what color's that one
brown
and what color's that one
well it's pink really
shall we roll it back
oh
make sure you don't lose them
are you going to draw that picture for nana and granddad
is that a fast road
okay
you put the car on
no
warren do it
what do you mean you want to put it on
what
you wanted to play some music
no
perhaps later
no
not at the moment
why don't you finish off this picture for nana and granddad
okay
it's called flick the crayon
oh
that wasn't very good was it
oh
hey ho
one two three
oh
hey
you shoveled two towards me then
thank you
i'll have the pink one
oh thank you
oh i got two back and you got one
one two three whee
oh and i've got all three
oh yes
look at those
i think the digger's outside
no
the digger's outside and wet and dirty
you could put them in the dumper truck
well we'll see but i think it's dirty because we've been digging in the garden with it
oh dear
did you go splashing in puddles yesterday
and what happened when you went splashing in those puddles
what happened
come back over here sweetheart and finish off your drawing
or i'm trying to think what else you could put your crayons in
i think you could probably put some in the tractor trailer you know
right
we just need the yellow bit off the top don't we now
i wonder where that is
here it is
yeah
i'm sure you can fit lots in
if you put them in carefully you'll be able to stack them up
it is
i don't know where the other bit is
you did didn't you
but that was when you were very little wasn't it
you didn't know then that you weren't supposed to chew crayons
you know now don't you
these all in the trailer
it's a little one isn't it
that one was broken wasn't it
i think you trod on it
and what's wrapped round the crayon
a bit or paper isn't it
oh yes
is that the same color as the other one
are they the same color
you're right
it is
it is
that's a long green one isn't it
well that's a different crayon
that's a different kind of green isn't it
it is isn't it but it's still got the sharp point on it hasn't it which is good for drawing
well it's not sharp
it's a point
i'm not sure that they'll all fit on actually
some of them might
you'll have to drive very carefully with all those crayons in the trailer
oh you'd better move those trains before they get run over
oh no
two have fallen off
oh no
what shall we do

let's have a go let's see if we can get some more vehicles on this car transporter
now these are a bit big that are on aren't they
shall we put some smaller ones on
then we can get more on
right
why don't we put these two on because they're designed to go on there aren't they
motorbike on a car transporter
why don't you look in your box for some smaller cars
hey hey
i'm gonna going to move
getting run over
oh there's another one of the cars that's designed to go on the car transporter
i wonder if the train'll stay up there
it might roll backwards pet
oh dear no
it won't willn't stay on will it
that one's too little
these this one fits on quite well doesn't it
yeah well that one's ideal because that's the one that you buy with it
let's see
i wonder if this tractor would fit on
it's too big isn't it
the wheels are too wide
no
that one's just right
that one's too small
i don't know
i wonder if this'll
perfect
what about this one
where did that come from
where did that one come from
oh warren
that's a dangerous driver in there isn't it
well you'll have to lift this up and then pull them out
that's it
put him in the tipper truck then
i'm not gonna going to stop you
it is isn't it
which one are you looking for
oh that's a nice little van isn't it
that's too small isn't it
did you get it from a shop
oh that's a good idea
it's too small to go on the low isn't it but it can go in the bus
can't it
will it fit in the bus
right
you want another one
a little one
here's the breakdown
will that fit
mind you
it might roll back down the ramp
what do you think

beep
bash
oh no oh no
where's the bus taking that little van
where's it going

is this a dual carriage
or a motorway
is it a dual carriage or a motorway though
what do you mean yeah
yes dual carriage or yes motorway
right
is it broken
oh dear
what's wrong with it
there we go
now all we have to do is try and find the key so it can come out if they want it to
i've no idea where that little key
ahhah
who says ahhah
sit down
hooray
be gentle with it pet
it's only little that one
don't press too hard
you'll break the wheels pet
no look
you're already starting to damage it warren
you mustn't press down hard on it
okay
push it gently like that
don't squash it
just push it gently
don't press it down
some vehicles it matter because they're very strong but that not very strong
gosh
it's going backwards and forwards a lot
does it keep going the wrong way
like mummy and daddy did on holiday
we kept going the wrong way didn't we
mummy would look at the map and say oh no
we should have turned off just there
it is a small road with a fast road round the edge
are you checking there are no trains coming
it does
he's got to stop there and see if any other vehicles are coming
oh now we're getting a queue aren't we
oh dear
oh dear
what's that horse up to
yeah
oh no
there's another car coming
this is a very long line
shall we find some other animals to keep the horse company
so he doesn't get lonely
there's a rhino
and
a baby tiger
where is it
where is it
in the dumper truck
oh did you have it at nana's today
it'll still be at nana's then
what's that you're blowing
what is it
it's a little windmill
from blackpool
no
don't
of course i'll hold it
may i blow it
warren blow
you don't need to make that raspberry noise as well
ugh
that's a horrid noise
oh look
the caravan's in pieces actually
i'll get it out and mend it shall i
if i can find all the pieces
we need the wheels now
there are the wheels
mummy put it back together
yes please
there you go
where are they going on holiday
oh it's left its caravan behind
that's good
shall i move the baby tiger so it doesn't get hurt
and then look at gordon
it's a very bendy road isn't it for a car and caravan
very bendy for a tractor as well
the tractor and trailer
the wrong way round
you have to move the caravan round or move the car
how many people are in the car
what are they called
two ladys
what are the ladys names
pardon
stuart and
imogen
do you like imogen
and oliver
that's right
imogen and
did you did you like imogen and oliver
was it fun playing with the big boy and big girl
that was a narrow gap for it to squeeze through
that was a very narrow gap
hey ho
that's the wrong way round
oh no
it's off the track
oh that's it
oh
just got back on in time didn't it
oh no
you've knocked something else off
poor little vehicle
gosh
that's a long line of cars isn't it
have they stopped at the traffic lights
yeah but why are they stopping
is the rhino jumping
humpty dumpty sat on a nothing
humpty dumpty had a great nothing
all the king's horses and all the kings nothings
couldn't put humpty together again
that's a funny old song
humpty dumpty sat on the nothing
what are you doing
i think the crane might be at nana's house
because you're going to nana's tomorrow you see
and the toys that you had there today daddy's left
collect it
where from
somewhere yeah
but where somewhere
i think it is at nana's somewhere
i don't think it can be anywhere else because i think all your vehicles are in your vehicle box aren't they
i don't think there are any messy ones
oh they've moved on a bit along the road haven't they
have the lights changed
don't go too fast with that caravan
that's fine
no
that's your windmill
oh can't blow it from here
warren try blowing hard
no
no you don't need to make all that horrible wet noise
come on
try again
you have to blow hard
that's horrid
what a horrid wet noise
no no
my arm was in the way then and that was truly horrible
oh
blow down your nose
mummy needs a clean hankie doesn't she really
done a lot wiping of your nose
right
i shall put
if you do that again i shall put the windmill away on a high shelf
i don't want you doing those horrible wet blows
no
no wet blows
just dry ones
oh
that's come right round again hasn't it
how's the caravan moving by itself
got no engine
oh well
never mind
why is it
why is it stuck
oh
listen to those wheels rushing round
can't go
why not
well i think it will go faster there because it's smoother than the carpet isn't it
also it's a fast road
we'll have to take the blue one off then
you put that other yellow one up then
put the red one up
yes
it is too big
that's quite small
it probably won't willn't be very safe
that's all
it might might roll about a bit
right
let's lock it and then go
that's a lovely noise
right
i don't think that's safe for those cars
they'll arrive so damaged won't willn't they
put the proper car back on there
what's happened to those cars at the bottom
look at them
yeah
i did
it did
do you know why it came off
yeah
but why did it come off
why wasn't it moving
because you were running over my toes
that's why
did they
why don't you play with one of your puzzles or something
or are you happy with your cars
which which vehicles are funny
which one
what color is it
it has got red on there
and what color's the rest of it
no
it's not white
what color is it
no
no
what's this color
it's yellow
yeah
what color's this vehicle
that's yellow
what color's that one
no
it's yellow
can i have a look at your new book
oh we'll read this book at bedtime i think
where's it going
no
keep it out of my t
well if you didn't try sticking it down my t i wouldn't push it away would i
where's it going
well i can't really go away
because if i went away when anna came to leave you'd be all by yourself in the house
noone to cook you your tea
and then what would you do
you did
you wanted me to go away when i picked you up from nana's didn't you
who did you want to pick you up
yeah
inferior mummy came didn't she
be careful because this vehicle's not very secure
can you see it moving about
it is really
which one are you after
oh okay
let's find the rest of the caravan then
just mind out of the way
well it's not much of a caravan when it's just the bottom bit
it's not even got any wheels sweetheart
there's the top bit
now where are the dratted wheels
do you know where the wheels are warren
you had them yesterday didn't you
a
they're there
oh are you just pulling it round
do you not want wheels
it's more like a sledge than a caravan
do you want to mend the caravan
okay
at least it looks like a caravan
here you go
so what do you have to say
yeah well those wheels won't willn't work on there though really
i suppose they'll just sit there won't willn't they
don't lose them
it has hasn't it
that's a very funny caravan
it's got no windows
i think that'd rain in wouldn't it warren
well i don't know
oh dear
shall we shall we build some bridges for it to go under
okay
shall we use your little bricks
i think little bricks be a good idea
these little ones
let's build a bridge for it
half of these are missing aren't they
never mind
oh um
just a sec
just a sec
i need to make these counterbalances a bit heavier
oh
silly old mummy
silly old mummy
is mummy silly
just a sec
let's make the bridgie bit
the arch in the middle
oh
that's like bulgie isn't it getting stuck under that bridge
but that bridge completely collapsed
maybe these are better for towers than bridges
let's see if it'll fit under this bridge
oh no
that one's landed in the car
what shall we do
what shall we do
is the brick going to drive
tell you what we could try doing
shall we stack some bricks on the trailer

there we go
whoops
there
she's watching the loudspeaker and your books
what're you making
what're you making
are you making a tower or a bridge
or a house
or a ship
or a boat
or an aeroplane
what're you making
a small big tower
wow
that's good isn't it
it certainly is isn't it
whoo
crash
oh dear
shall we put that on like that
oh
there you go
what color's that brick
that one
what color is it
is it
that's a funny sort of red
a yellowy kind of red
that's yellow isn't it
which is the funny carriage
warren
where's the funny carriage
oh fill the carriage
sorry
i thought you said funny carriage
gosh
it is isn't it
right
so your tower's getting smaller and the pile of stuff in your trailer's getting bigger isn't it
i think it might
that's it
there we go
that's really big
that is a really tall pile of bricks on your trailer truck
where are they going to go
that is a funny train
you've got bits missing off that
here's the dome and the funnel
shall we find the cow
ahhah
shall we make the train
i don't know where the driver is
you keep your eyes peeled for him
do you want to put the cab on
then you can find the driver and put him in
where is the driver
hadn't you better find the driver
do you want me to look for a driver
yes please
is it the driver with legs that goes in here
which hand
there he is
he was late this morning wasn't he for his train
oh dear
it's like henry and the flying kipper derailed
oh no
look at that
disaster
well press it down properly then it's fixed okay
might be a bit stronger in there
okay
there's one man
can you see any more men
well keep looking because they'll be in there
i can see one
oh no
i can't
it's the baby tiger that i can see
both peeping in together trying to look for men
right
you just wait there
i don't know
you stay here and play with the bricks while mummy goes and sees who it is
won't willn't be a minute warren
i think it might be nana and granddad
it might be
no warren
you stay here
talk to them later
can you find me the man
it's some people that you're going to see later
some people who are going to eat their tea in our dining room
in the bomb site
oh did i tread on your foot pet
i'm sorry
i normally take my shoes off don't i
shall i kiss it
your foot's better now
look at you with your trousers falling off
i'm sure that used to squeak
hey
that makes a good noise doesn't it
the car going over that
can you see the bits of gate
there we go
is that to keep animals in or out
no
it can't can it
i haven't taken these bricks from any of your things warren
i've just taken them from where they were
sitting by my knee
it's interesting peeping because you see the reflections in the bricks
excuse you
warren
what's what
oh yes
oh yes
that's a bull
a daddy cow
there's a bull and a cow
a bull is like a daddy cow and a cow is like a mummy cow
and a warren cow is a calf
that's the baby cow
the little boy cow
no
that's a horse dear
let's look for a baby cow
i don't know if there is a baby cow actually
is that a baby cow
no
it's a sheepdog
close
not much difference
i can't find a baby cow
maybe there isn't one
oh you've got a goat
course it can
remember the monkey has to stand on its feet
push its feet on
it bends over with its bottom stuck up in the air
look
you have to put it on like that
i think
there you go
what's the monkey saying as the train drives along
whoops
oh look at that
what shall we do
i think that's a bit of a high load
perhaps you ought to spread it out and have some on one truck and some on another
rather than it all being on one truck
i think there are only two
well you can use your trailer but you must remember that it's your trailer and not anna's
all right
otherwise anna will take it home
shall we remember that that's yours
look at that
that's a long train isn't it
right
how many trailers have you got
rubbish
how many have you got
three trailers
that's right
and one engine
it is isn't it
those are very high
crumbs
i hope they don't come to a low bridge
i don't think i can make a bridge high enough
let's have a go
let's try making a very high bridge
can you pass me some more bricks please
that's because you're not looking for them
we've got to try and make this bridge big enough for that train to go through haven't we
hey ho
if you do it mate you'll wreck it
are they the same height
no
they're not
silly mummy
it helps if they're the same height doesn't it
right
will the engine fit through
well the engine will but will the trailer fit through though
you think so
shall the baby tiger sit on top and just check
warren
i've made an especially high bridge for your especially high load and now you've got a low load
never mind
you've got a giraffe watching as well
you've lost that trailer
well put it back on then
beep
open the gates
hey
it's crashed into my leg
you need the gates sorry at the same height
that would make them the same height
which one
oh they can fit under the gates
oh that's handy
high up gates and low down gates
poop
oh i see
well you just knocked it off
no
why don't you put that high up with the other blue gate
that's it
shall i turn it round so it can drive back
poop
oh no
it's come off
you can't run the horse over now look
it's stuck behind the gate
when the gate opens it'll protect the horse
shall i wipe its eyes
warren
can i do anything right
you're a dreadful child warren
well what does that gate do up there warren
what's it doing
it's peeping
i don't think gates are supposed to peep
i thought gates were supposed to keep things out or things in
well it'll fit through if the train's not there
right
the tiger'll come and open the gates
shall i go and sit in the kitchen warren
oh
you rotter
what did you just say
i'm not being horrid
who's being horrid
why am i being horrid
i think i'm lovely
oh okay
horrid warren
are you horrid
warren
are you horrid
oh warren
let's make your bridge again
you want to make a little bridge
you want a smaller bridge than the last one
okay
now where's the other
ah
which
that one
is that bridge better
what's that horse doing
jumpy jumping
who's driving that car
shall we put nothing in it
ah
some bricks are driving it
okay
shall i put it back on
there we go
what's the car going to do
oh
that's exciting what's inside that car
three bricks
a yellow one and black one and a green one
are they
what's not going
anna's going quite soon
well you weren't playing with them
warren
you are perverse
yeah
he is
beep
what does the car go
what does the car say then
what do elephants say
they say jumpy jumpy on the side
no
it can't can it
it'll have to move the animals
that's true
we don't want the elephant being run over
it might damage the car
is it
oh dear
what's happened to it
oh is this a breakdown train
it's terrible
i'm not sure that shoving it is the best option actually
oh yes
if it rains he'll get a wet head won't willn't he
what's on that little bit
no
you can look later
we'll look later on warren
tell you what
i'll just go and get your other your bag of toys because we brought a whole bag of toys didn't we
here they are
here they are
what can you find in there
because you've been so busy playing in the garden we've not had time to get those out yet
what's in there
a
right
shall we open the bag over here
bring your stuff over here
shall i put your track out so you can play with your vehicles on the track
i'll put it out over here where there's a nice big space
oh your sticker's over here as well
you'd better put your sticker on
that says you've been to the dentist doesn't it
or shall i put the sticker on your ambulance
has the ambulance been to the dentist
let's get this flat
it's a bit creased isn't it where it's been in the bag
there you go
do you want a boat on the canal
what are these doing in your toy bag
those smelly old pumps
where's that road gone
has it fallen off the edge of the hill
is the ambulance going to turn round
yeah
yeah
that's a good idea
yeah
there is i think isn't there
and look
we've got a road sign here
are you going to put that near a junction
no
i don't think we've got any trains actually
don't think we put any in did we
well i think it's a bit too far to go back home to get them sweetheart
we could pretend these bricks were trains couldn't we
choo
shall we flatten this out a bit more
that's the problem with it being folded up
screwed up in the bag
there we go
oh yes
oh yes
why has it had to stop
is there a train coming
oh
so it has
shall we get some more vehicles out
move what
that's the car that goes in your car transporter isn't it
so it is
have we got the parts to mend it
i don't think we have
here's the wheels
we haven't got any other bits
i can guess who put these two pieces in the bag
warren
that's not much good is it
that's very broken
it's missing two pieces
we can't mend it without them
that's right
we can certainly mend it when we get home
oh look at them
oh
they're not that new
we bought them to go on holiday didn't we
the problem is sweetheart
you've got three three lots of puzzle piece all mixed up
well i'll put them into piles of puzzles
okay
this is the parrot puzzle
that can go there
you want to do the lion puzzle
okay
let's find the lion puzzle pieces then
okay
here are the lion puzzle pieces
two four six eight
those are the lion pieces
there's the panda pieces
if you chew them mate they're going
oh there's another lion piece
why don't you do the lion one
don't put them in your mouth please
why don't you do the lion one
i think there might be some more missing
or is there
oh no
there are nine pieces
no
that's right
snap snap
ouch
well why don't you put the puzzle together
shall we do it on why don't you do it on the carpet
then it's easier to see what the pattern is on the pieces
how do they fit together now
is that a good fit
rubbish
you need the curly tail
you need the end of the baby lion's tail
it's curling
try that one again
is that a good fit
no
well you try it
you try it at the top corner
it's got whiskers on
is that a good fit
it does go there
you try it again
there you go
is that a good fit
it is isn't it
you've nearly finished it
only two more pieces
right
which do you want to do next
the snaky one
okay
those are snaky ones
shall i move this and then we've got more space on the carpet here
mind your bot
there you go
we can put the mat out again later
let's get these all turned up the right way
this has got more pieces in so it's more difficult
uhoh
uhoh
no
why don't we look for pieces with the snake on
can you find pieces with the purple on like that
yeah
now find another piece with purple on
no
that one doesn't
find all the pieces with purple on
you've got those two
are there any more pieces with purple on like that
look no
the pieces are all here
can you see any pieces here with purple on
that one
okay
we'll put that over here
can you see any more
no
find all the pieces with purple
find all the
are there any more pieces with purple
just there
that's it
are there any more pieces with purple on here
right
so now these pieces must go together because they've got the same sort of color on
that's it
good boy
it certainly does
so where does that piece go
do you think
are you sure
what about here
lots of purple missing there
it would help if the picture were the right way round
look
now you've got the snake
there's just a little bit of his nose missing
you look for a piece of puzzle with tiny tiny pieces of purple on
two tiny pieces of purple
do you think
what about that
has that got tiny pieces of purple on to go on the snake's nose
oh yes
and what what's this
that's the parrot's nose
can you find the rest of the parrot's head
no
there's only one eye because the other eye's on the other side of his head
no
it can't can it
no
need a piece with two straight edges
can you see how that one's got two straight edges
we need a straight edge there and a straight edge there
can you see one with a little bit of carrot on
carrot
parrot on and some leafs
there we go
try the other way round
that's it
there you go
finished that one
which one are you going to do
the giraffe one
do you think
do you think
maybe you need some more pieces before that one will fit on properly
i don't think that one will fit on straight away will it
two what
what are they
that's right
two giraffes
no
you've got these pieces here as well
where are they going to go
i beg your pardon
oh no
you're dribbling
dribbling
no
take it out
take it out
put it down down the ambulance
aren't you going to finish the puzzle
no
i don't want you putting that in your mouth
oh
if you put it in your mouth warren it goes away on a high shelf where you can't reach it
because it's not safe for little boys to put in their mouths
well i'm going to do this puzzle
you want to help
can you tell me where this piece goes please
yeah
i think it does
you're very clever
twaddle
it does not go there
yes
hey
what's on this picture
how many birds
what's that
what kind of fly
it's actually a butterfly
that's a funny place for it to go
right
shall we do the last puzzle
this is a hard one
you'll have to do it for me
what animal is it
a what
a greekia
what's it eating for lunch

doesn't look like banana to me
oh you've done all the puzzles now
shall we put them in the box

no
let's make it up in the box
don't break
warren
don't break them up please because they won't willn't fit in the box if they're in pieces
okay
because the pieces are all different sizes

the doll wants to watch what you're going to do with it
if she can stay sitting up long enough

you come and put the mat here
that's it
do you
well shall we move these bits then so we can make a bridge

that's all right warren

you apologize very sweetly
but then you are a sweet youth sometimes aren't you warren
aren't you
you're lovely
sometimes
i am making you a bridge
i think a car probably will go under
now i need some more big pieces

now don't you press on it because you'll probably break it dear
just like i've done
silly mummy
what has she done
no warren
don't you apologize
it's my useless bridge
isn't it useless
well i suppose you could do actually
let me just swipe these
can't you
you can
where are they
oh that's her shoe isn't it
i wonder where her pants are
she had them last week
yeah
well
they might be some they might be in the other bag of stuff mightn't they
let's get this bridge finished shall we
whoops

the panda can't
or can he
just fits
make the bridge a bit taller
i'm making it taller now
whoops
oh
right
mummy lift it up
putting everything
even this
oh look at these
this is a very fancy bridge
oh yes
have you seen any pigs
where did you see them

it's quite a fat piglet isn't it
oh right

what's he going to have for tea
sausages
just sausages or sausages with something
do you like sausages
what are you ahhahing about
you have got two men haven't you
what're they going to do
there he is
what're you going to do with those three men
okay
that's all right
it's a very safe place to watch cars isn't it
well away well off the road aren't they up there
because they're sensible men aren't they
they won't willn't run about and be silly on top of the bridge
what about the other one
where is he
who's a silly
is he
why
what's he done
whoops
oh dear
did it fall off
it did didn't it
it went crash
what's what
tweeting
well what do you think it is tweeting outside
no
that's not a good idea really
oh come here
go and look at the window
what can you hear
quickly
go and look out the window
quick quick quick
what can you see
hey
don't fiddle with the blinds
how many horses
now get down off the chair
you mustn't
no
you mustn't do it again
warren
no
you've got your sandals on
that's nana's nice chair
choo
that's more like it
move it across a tiny bit
you see its feet
you see the monkey's feet warren
you see they've got little holes in
you put a bobble in each little hole
it'll fit on
that's it
i'm not sure that's a good place for the monkey
or is he driving
it is
i think you might crash because the monkey's not watching where he's going
you have got your soft stuff here somewhere
well i'm not sure where it is
well do you know where it is
and i don't think it's a good idea to play with soft stuff in this room
because it's nana's new carpet
and i'm not sure that soft stuff and new carpets go together very well
you can play with anna's toys
you can play with soft stuff anytime
you can't play with these anytime
shall i put the panda's t on
you want him bare
oh
bare apart from his shoes
you can't get those shoes off
they're painted on
a big little bridge
that is a tiny tiny bridge
i don't think the train'll fit through that tiny tiny bridge
oh dear
no
oh
who's on that trailer
who is it on the trailer
yeah
what kind of creature is it though
do you know
can you remember
panda's having a piggy
oh
poor panda's fallen
i don't know
you look for them
don't just say where's another one and expect me to get it because i won't willn't
i've had a hard day warren
all you've done is go to the dentist and go shopping
sounds like a fun day to me
but poor mummy's been out working earning corn
who's what
the shadow
that's the plants in the garden making a shadow on the blinds
no
you can go outside later
i'll have a sleep
oh
oh you rotter
no
don't bash mummy with toys
if you're going to bash mummy with toys they will go straight back in the box
and you won't willn't have any toys to play with
well you mustn't beat people with toys
you mustn't beat people with anything in fact
you'd like a bridge
shall we mend this one and make it a little bit bigger so the train can fit through
well not quite
just just just hold your horses
that better
there we go
that's a good gate isn't it
look at all
my goodness
there are lots of gates here
which way is it going to go
oh the little shover
oh
the cow
i wondered what you meant by a little shover
it's called a cow
okay
that's all right
you don't have to have it on if you don't want it
actually what
oh yes
it is because engines can push as well pull can't they locomotives
so it's pushing one and pulling one isn't it now
i don't know sweetheart
you had it last
oh yes
sorry warren
i just destroyed your tower your bridge
never mind
i shall build it again
there
that was quick wasn't it
it was mummy trying to stick a penguin on the top
these penguins i think are really hard to put on
i always forget
ahhah
now what's that disappearing into your sock
might squeeze through just
close
do you know the penguin nearly bangs his head every time he goes through
that poor penguin
does it
no
it doesn't really fit on the back very well does it
because it gets in the way of the coupling
you put it on the front
no
it goes on those bobbles
those two knobbles
that's it
and that moves forward a bit like that
okay
i won't willn't since you're saying please
and nice boys say please
are you a nice boy
okay
what's that hole for
is it for peeping through
is this a peeping hole
warren peep
yeah
who made all that mess
warren
who made all that mess
warren made all that mess
they're broken
no
granddad's very clever at mending things but he can't mend the tyres
no
these are broken tyres now
they can't be mended
look at that one
there's only one tyre on the car that's all right
no
that one's broken
that one's broken
and that one's broken
that one's very broken
no
don't do that
you'll spoil them
the poor car with broken tyres
has it
yeah
no
it isn't
that's because you can't break it
that's the only reason why
well it still runs doesn't it
it just probably perhaps can't go very fast
oh look at that tyre
it's a bit heavy for this breakdown isn't it
it's too heavy
shall we build a fence on this lego
that one is broken isn't it
i wonder if we can see the other part of it
you see it might have broken a long time ago and daddy threw it out
i can't get this
oh yes i can
look
what's this
a little flag isn't it
that's good that because it sticks onto the lego
look
they are hard
your little lego's easier to use isn't it
well you've got some of your bricks here
nana's gone
she's gone away
yeah
she's gone to do some housework
i think
or she's going to sit with her feet up
oh that sticks onto the little lego
now that's handy
now that's a very tall neck isn't it
yeah
now mummy's going to do an experiment with these
oh
look at that
what are you making
a snow car
wow
you probably can yeah
you can make whatever you like dear
if you want to make a snow car you make a snow car
look
arms
legs and feet and a body
put a baseball hat on it
whoops
have i knocked its arm off
never mind
you don't have wheels on your head
he's a one armed creature
oh
legs have dropped off
never mind
look at that
oh
oh
there's one foot
where's the other foot
where's and there's his leg
well that's a funny arrangement of legs and feet
what kind of vehicle
are you still making the snow vehicle
you can't
why not
why can't you make the snow vehicle
hey
that's my foot
pooh
well i can pooh your feet mate
pooh old feet
no
i don't recommend it
no
i don't think you want to smell anna's feet
i don't think she's into foot smelling
i'll get them for you later
well i want doesn't get darling as your grandma and nana always say
that's a whinie little voice
oh
snap snap
what's in this sock
what is it
is it little bits of cheese
a
what is it
it's lego is it
what's lego doing in your sock
is it
shall we have a cheese buttie
shall i tip it out
see what it is
where shall i tip it
look at all those bits of lego
is that tasty
it would hurt if you put your sock on wouldn't it
it certainly is
whoops
oh
well i hope it doesn't break
think it will
oh no
don't chew
i think this bulldozer's going to er tidy up your lego
where shall it put it
oh i'll put it in this car
goes back to pick some more up
oh
look at all these roofing tiles
i've not seen these for years
what you do is you kind of fit them together and you can make little roofs for houses
make little lego houses and put roofs on
yes
no
it's quite difficult making houses out of lego
because you need to remember things like doors and windows
i always used to forget those
here's a little house
some bits of roof missing
i wonder if we can find those missing pieces
for the roof
this is a different kind of roof this is
no
it can't fit in
you're quite right
oh
i wonder where those missing pieces might be
whoops
is that one right
no
silly mummy
is it
okay
let's let's just pull it apart a bit
let's pull the red ones off
i'm not convinced
oh no
now mummy's wrecking the hole thing
i'll get into trouble won't willn't i
oh no oh no
poor mummy will get into trouble if i've broken it
what
you try putting it there then
from the back like that
yes
now we're a bit another bit missing here
a little red bit missing
i wonder where that might be
oh hang on
hang on
hang on
let's just wreck this again
oh no
oh no oh no
silly old mummy
is mummy silly
oh
is mummy sensible
a
hey ho
warren
look
can you put that back please
i'm trying to mend it
why are you breaking it apart
oh it's all broken
all broken
oh
doesn't don't you want a door in your house
that's a door look
well how are people going to get in and out if there's no door
yes but darling if there's no door how are they going to get in and out
through the window
what a funny boy
in and out through the window
why is the bonnet up on that mini
let's have a look
you show me the mini car
why is the bonnet up
oh it's got a piece of lego in the engine
oh you'll have to put smaller pieces in there won't willn't you
no
little pieces will fit in
little pieces like these will fit in
shall we see how many pieces we can fit it
whoops
look at all those pieces
are they all out
that one's driving is it
has it
let's have a look
no
i think it's just the axle's jammed
this one hasn't worked for a long time has it
perhaps tomorrow you might be able to choose another vehicle like that
do you think along with a book
no
the wheels can't be mended
no
they can't i'm afraid
mummy's tried and granddad's tried
and we've both failed
and if mummy can't do it and granddad can't do it then there no chance for anyone doing it
no
the wheels just don't go round
that's the problem
well i think i think the car needs to go to the garage really doesn't it
for somebody to mend it
perhaps we should have taken it to the garage this morning with mummy's car
well yes
daddy's and mummy's
mummy's at the moment because mummy's driving it
but i'm not driving it am i
derek's driving it
that man is driving it
he probably is
it is and it's broken really
yes it is
what color is it
what color is your car
green
rubbish
what's this
what color's this
it's not called green
it's called white
and what color's this
it's like mummy and daddy's car isn't it
what color is it
it's izzy whizzy let's get busy
that's a funny color
it's black
with a white roof
those are green aren't they
no
it's not
that's right
and what color's the roof
well it's green now because you're putting the tiles on it yes
what color's your t
well it is where you've put the tile
what color's the dog
yes
what color's the dog if there's no tile
is it
that's probably because you're jabbing lego bricks into it
oh don't
that'll hurt
strange child
how many bricks have you got in there
yeah
not very good at balancing is it
shall we try and balance the roof on your leg
there you go
oh dear
shall we try balancing this road sign on your knee
hold your knee very still
oh
that wasn't much good was it
try that way
a
propped up now isn't it
well i hope the car does go stop otherwise he'd bash the engine wouldn't he
the front in
well it's not really a very good idea for cars to crash
that's why they have brakes
yes they do
but it's not nice if they do
oh dear oh dear
had the ambulance better come
and the policecar
oh who's on the phone
it's for you
no
it's for you
oh
have they hung up
oh is it
who is it
who did you phone
is charlie on the phone
where is charlie
well that's because you're not really supposed to get round
you'll decapitate yourself
why are you crawling round there
are you going to be up to wickedness
are you doing wicked things round there
oh warren
who are you talking to
are you peeping
i can just see your tufty hair sticking up
you need a hair don't you
who is
matt
no
matt isn't going to cut it
well matt does cut long hair but he does cut short hair as well
it's just that mummy hasn't got matt's phone number so she can't get him to come here
we'll take you to dean's hair shop tomorrow
and near dean's shop there is a bookshop
because we're going to buy you a book tomorrow i think aren't we
why are we going to buy you a book
yes well if you will kick me
that's your fault for kicking anna's foot mate
why are we going to buy you a book tomorrow
no
why are we going to get you a book
is it because you're a big boy
yeah
there was wasn't there
a
what's that
a brick

i thought it was something more sinister
why are we going to buy you a book tomorrow
can you remember
can you remember
do you remember
why are you getting smily faces on a chart
can you remember
no
don't break it apart
no no no
mummy was trying to mend it
oh
you don't want it mended
right
they're hard to get apart aren't they these little legos
oh look

are you mending it or just destroying it
destroying it
okay
you'll have to speak to granddad very nicely later won't willn't you and say please granddad mend the house
if you want it mended
you don't
okay
all right
okay
that's all right
are you going to make something else with the bricks

i was going to say i've never seen a green fire but i have
an army fire
they're green
oh and here comes a policecar
oh
they did didn't they
well it's not surprising because there's nobody driving the policecar
who
the egg is going to drive is it
well i know policeman are getting very young but i don't think they're that young
is it
well don't you go round calling policeman eggs
or eggheads will you
you wouldn't be very popular
nee
be very careful
we don't want the egg to break
where are the eggs going
where's it off to
is it
little lisper
and where's fireman sam's
oh right
and what's happened to fireman sam
why does he need an ambulance

oh warren
that will make a nice loud noise
well i don't think it's broken
i hope it's not broken
it might be broken
yeah
you would be in trouble
i don't think it's broken warren
it's all right
phew
just mind my tea
oh is the tender going to roll it
right
right
let's see if henry can catch it
oh
the rabbit caught it
right
henry'll send it again
brumm
that's not a train noise is it
chuff
beep
henry's better than the tender isn't he
perfect
what what are the pictures inside this ball that turn round
oh
that nearly hit your cake
it did hit your cake again
it's a saucy ball isn't it
whoops
thank you
oh that was my knuckle
no
it was my knuckle
no
it's absolutely sweet of you to kiss my leg but it was actually my knuckle that it hit but never mind
count to three
whoops
this ball is supposed to be played with in the bath warren
see if we can get it whizzing round again shall we
there we go
look at it spinning round in the middle
henry's not very good at it is he
henry's getting bored
he wants to go on the track
let's see if we can put some more exciting things on this track for henry to play with
yeah
that's probably a good idea isn't it
shall we put a lion in the field
which field shall the lion go in
okay
where's this lion from
it was off adam's birthday cake
that's right
can you remember how many candles adam had
hooray
did you
yeah
hey it's good playing in here
because we don't have to rush anywhere to look out of the window at the ambulances do we
we see lots of ambulances don't we
so did i
those two lovely animals
what kind of lovely animals are they
well you tell me what are they
what kind of animal are they
are they lions
what are they
they're sheep with long long horns aren't they
we saw some sheep the other day with long horns
and we saw some goats with long long horns as well didn't we
the goats had longer horns than the sheep had
you're an elephant
i always thought there was something strange about you
is that what it is
you're an elephant
and i always thought you were a boy
a level crossing is it
there's some vehicles waiting at the level crossing
wrong vehicle waiting
which vehicle should it be
no
they don't
no
they don't come on roads
do they
i don't think
trams do sometimes but trains don't
and henry is definitely a train
he's not a tram
yes
trams do but trains don't
trains stay on rails
no
because the problem is
you're not going to listen to reason are you
so i won't willn't bother explaining about tracks
we saw a helicopter this morning didn't we
is the helicopter in here
are its rotor in there because they were kicking about in your bed weren't they
i think your rotor may be somewhere missing
maybe i vacuumed them up last night
yes
keys for the windows of our last house
yes
they are your keys
there's one of those keys that we need to post back
yeah
your rotor aren't here i'm afraid
no
that's not right
this is the key for that
shall we wind it up
no
don't bash it
i don't think so
make sure you don't run over your biscuit
it was
well keep the wheels on the floor while you wind it up
otherwise it'll just unwind
bash
what are you after
right okay
the problem is it's a very strong train
it might knock them over
but it's a very good idea
oh no
it can't
it's all fenced in isn't it
is there another one
i didn't know that we had more than three
that's right
and warren
you know gnome
her boyfriend drives a policecar
he's just learning how to drive it very fast so he can chase people
is that exciting
you've never been in a fire have you
you've never been in an ambulance either
perhaps one day you might be able to go in an ambulance in the ambulance station down the road
well they do go
well it might fall off
yes
what a funny thing
did you
what
just now
just drove past
who knocked the lion over
a
where's gnome
gnome's in the hall talking to daddy
gnome's going to go to the shops with daddy
no
we're going to some shops with daddy and gnome this afternoon
and you're going to buy a vehicle
you're going to choose one aren't you
we're going to go to a vehicle shop and you will choose one
because you have just had your tenth night without a dummy
it's a good job you survived because we didn't have any to give you as spares
no
it hasn't
bye
are you going to wave out of the window
i hadn't realized the wind man was here
look
there's the wind man van wind man's van
he has
i bet they flash orange don't you
he's mending our leaky wind
mummy got wet feet didn't she on the way back from irene'shouse
mummy shrieked and said oh what's that on my foot
and i couldn't stop and look could i because we were on a windy country lane in the pouring rain and there was nowhere to stop
and then a bit later on
oh what's that on my other foot
is that what happens in the rain
you sometimes play out in the rain don't you
that's right
and what do you have on your feet
that's right
you've got shoes on now
and i think you're going to need new shoes
i hope
right
before i forget warren
shall we put the answerphone on
actually no
we'll leave it off
because it'll probably be quicker for me actually to answer the phone
no
we'll leave it on because otherwise we'll have to um listen to the message
and it might be something secret and private
mightn't it
you want to see that man
well he's in the garage
you'll be able to see him in a few minutes
he'll be a little while he'll be quite a while mending the wind
no
not this window
the wind on the car
the thing you look out of at the front
yeah
with the little stickers on
he's he's mending it
because it's leaking
mummy got wet feet
and we got a wet carpet
are you sleeping
a
i've no idea where
oh it popped
i do know where it is
it popped
it did
daddy daddy
who was daddy with when it popped
malcolm
do you remember when
oh no
you were in bed
no
you weren't in bed
when malcolm came and mummy was ironing and you were watching the dog and the cat and you were playing with your balloon weren't you
then mummy took you up for your bath
and daddy and malcolm were sitting in the kitchen having a drink and suddenly the balloon went pop
and it burst
and daddy doesn't know why it went pop because it was just sitting there
it does
balloons do pop if you sit on them generally
don't they
you had a really good one
a shiny one that went float float float in the air
they did
that's right
and james came off the rails in a field didn't he with some animals in it
can you remember what the animals were in the field where james came off the rails
what were they
they were
cows weren't they
you have tipped haven't you
oh dear
oh dear
shall oh let's get the crane to lift you up
here's the crane
let's lift the boy
let's hook this round
oh it's not on very well
let's tuck it in
right
up you come
come on
the crane's lifting you
come on
up you come
oh it's come unhooked
let's hook it in again
let's hook it in here
lift the boy
lift him up
up you come
hooray
that's a good crane isn't it that can lift boys up
it probably would lift the sheep up actually
we shouldn't really be playing with these
these are daddy's sheep
never mind
look at that
a sheep on a crane
brumm
which field's he going in
is he going in the field with the lion and the cows
it's a bit of a dangerous field for sheep because lions like eating sheep
they probably like eating cows actually
never mind
tell you what
shall we put the sheep in the field with terrence the tractor
there's one sheep with terrence
what're you doing
are you trying to lift the other sheep
you hook it on then
oh
he is isn't he
poor terrence with a sheep standing on him
they do keep falling on the rail
i hope henry doesn't come and run that sheep over
will henry stop
that's good
so what's going to happen
what can henry do
can he
a flying train
is that because he's called the flying kipper sometimes
this tunnel
henry's tunnel
yes
it's not a very good idea kneeling like that
right
can you just stand up
i'll move my legs and then you can kneel properly like that
no
you just turn one round
that's it
okay
yeah
you need both of those don't you otherwise it won't willn't work
where's the other one
oh i hope it's not lost
where is it
ahhah
there it is
no
the ball's too big
other way round
that's it
you want to make a garage
well you can't really make a garage out of track
because a garage is a building isn't it that things go inside
no
it's not
well let's mend it then
oh you want it broken
henry will crash
henry will get derailed
excellent
if you turn the bridge round
there warren
turn the bridge round
it'll fit now
that's it
they can
shall we make a track that goes under the bridge
right
let's get some more track
make this track go under the bridge
where's your tractor
i've no idea where your tractor is
look in your vehicle box
i don't think it'll fit under the bridge my love
no
so we need another little short long short straight bit
not short long
keep this curving round
what do you mean hey
hey
hey
hey ho
make a bumpy track
well that is a bumpy old track isn't it
move your feet
oh yes
i see what you mean
no straights in it
right
are there any more bumpy bits
no
there aren't
we'll have to do our best here with
warren
what are you talking about
they're not christmas trees
they're bits of track
don't don't bend it too much because it might break
all right
now we've got a we've got a problem here mate
we have
won't willn't fit
rats
rats rats
right
we're gonna going to have to have some straight bits in i think
so it'll fit
rats rats
ahhah
there we go
look at it
it's a good track isn't it
whoops
here's henry
chuff
where's his tender
tender was playing with the ball before wasn't it
where is it now
is it in the box
oh i can see his tender
it's over here
here it is
oh look at that
well we'll have to move that then
that's a funny old thing on the bridge
it might bump into henry
oh no
hey
henry's in his tunnel
oh dear oh dear
what a thing
yes
you say it's derailed
if the wheels are off the track it's derailed
are they happy birthday trees
good
what kind of creatures are those warren
yes
a big rabbit and a little rabbit isn't there
oh no
that's the wrong way round
that's it
henry's on the transporter where you put him
his tender's on the track
yes warren
that's a good idea
okay
the panda's bare as well
he normally has clothes on doesn't he
where's the panda going
is he just driving around for a little drive
i don't know
shall we look for her pants
are you going to put them on her
i hope you put them on her more successfully than you put your own pants on
you fell down the stairs the other day didn't you because you'd got two legs in one leg hole
you got tangled up didn't you
a bit like a mermaid
put the right leg through the right leg hole
like that
the left leg through the left leg hole like that
and then you pull them up
she's got plain white pants hasn't she
you've got some plain white pants as well
i think you're wearing green ones today
yeah
dolly's got white ones
i think yours are green
yes they are
you've got green ones on
oh yes
there's a hippo in the trailer
there's part of the train
i think somebody's taken the train apart
shall we look for the pieces
and maybe
okay
if that makes you happy
are you moving all these things out of the way
that's a good idea
then they won't willn't get buried will they
are you going to tip
right
that's all the pieces out now isn't it
a
there's part of the train as well
you've got the cab and here's the cow
there we go
where's the driver
hooray
no
he hasn't
you'll have to find him some coaches
right
are you going to go and find his coaches now
can i just do your shoelace up
warren
we'll just do up your shoelace
it's a bit short because it broke didn't it
these are very ancient shoes
your feet haven't grown for months and months and months
there you go
it will fit if you just get it in the right position
like there
that's it
a
i see you're getting them the right way round to get coupled
that's very sensible
where's the engine taking the train
where's the hippo going
oh
what are they going to do in manchester
are they going to go shopping in manchester
that's a good idea
where did i put your mat
oh it's there
oh right
they're standing in a nice line aren't they
they're being very polite
how many people are there on the train
excellent
okay
i don't think that engine fits on your track warren
no
well i don't know that it's a good idea having your vehicles out
we could get your mat out couldn't we for the train to go on
your mat's just next to the box
just next to the vehicle box on the floor
because we know that that mat's yours don't we
that's right
this is a good mat isn't it for downstairs on the shiny floors
because it doesn't slip
right
and then anna's train can come on this track can't it
what's the matter
somebody had better open the gate then
okay
those poor people on the train waiting to go to manchester shopping
never mind
that's right
there's a blue one over there
near the cow
the bull
we saw some pigs the other day didn't we
they were having a shower from the hose pipe
they liked getting the water on their bodys didn't they
it was a hot day
oh i see
you've made a level crossing
aren't you clever
are you clever
no
is somebody going to come and open the gates
well shall mummy open one and warren open the other
who is
oh the panda's going to open the gate
now that's a good idea
aren't you kind helping panda
i'll hold that still and you and panda can open the gate
oh panda's
right well what we can do
we'll put the gate on there
it won't willn't fall over then
there we go
right
is the train going to drive through now
oh is he
who's going to help him
warren or mummy
okay
are you ready
are you ready panda
one two three
right
oh
the train's going to set off isn't it now
come on train
so he is
i don't actually know if the panda stands up
i've never tried actually
oh balancing the panda
hooray
he's not a very good train driver is he if his passengers keep falling out
so what's going to happen to those people that have fallen out of the train
oh is he going to see if they're all right
oh
why is he
what's he doing then
if you push them down like that
that's it
blow the whistle
you count and then i'll blow
well we'd better get the gate open then
well if you have it stuck on that side then it won't willn't fall over
shouldn't fall over
that's right
if we have it across like that diagonally it shouldn't fall over
let's just see if it will fall over
see
brill
won't willn't fall over
oh that might fall over
oh yes it can
put it like that
do you see how it's going diagonally across the square
it just stays upright
shall panda close this one
well they're not going to get to manchester very quickly are they
all these gates closed
oh that's better isn't it
why poor panda
why was he sad before
he's happy now
was he sad before
right
that's all that matters really isn't it
did you
no
i've never been on a panda either
i don't think you can go on pandas
not real ones
might be able to go on toy pandas
pretend play pandas at the park
do they
you be fire you were fireman sam earlier on today weren't you
you were squirting us with that belt hose
two what
what's this for
oh
this egg box is getting broken isn't it
no
you didn't break it pet
i don't think
somebody did break it
okay
shall we put the bricks away
shall mummy put the bricks away while you get the shopping out

it's far more exciting getting shopping out than putting bricks away
are you eating
very tasty
oh yes
how many eggs have you got
which little hole
that'll do
well how many are there there
are there four
count them again properly
one two three

yes
no
take that out of your mouth
oh
yes
when people are poorly they go in ambulances don't they
if people aren't poorly they don't need to go in ambulances
and only very poorly people go in ambulances
because mostly when people are poorly they just go to bed have some medicine and they're all right
but if people are very poorly they go in an ambulance to hospital
don't they

that is a wobbly tower isn't it
okay
are you going to make it
what what color
what color do you want
or is it the shape you're after
you could use that big green arch couldn't you
they're a bit far apart aren't they those two

if you put that across there you can put some more on top can't you and make it taller
you could use these
these ones are quite good
if you put those put those on top like that
put those up like that and put this yellow arch on
oh it's going to fall
oh dear
it's a bit wobbly on this rug isn't it

you can't really roll it on the floor like a wheel
it doesn't work that way
it does wobble doesn't it
are you making a wobbly tower

now it's foolish breaking things isn't it
now mummy's got to try and get this tyre out
i need something to try and pry it out warren
what shall i use
oh there's a pen up here
that might work
let's have a go
there we go
the tyre's back on properly now

okay
i'm not a climbing frame
oh down you go
what do you think the ambulance driver
oh well be gentle with the ambulance driver
who happens also to be your mummy
oh no
can you empty it out onto the mat
not onto the table
there we go
what're you going to make with this
okay
oh that's pretty
that's good isn't it
are you going to make another butterfly on there now on the top
hey
there we go
i shall make a car in the white stuff
why not
a boat on top of the car
that will be interesting
tell you what we can do
if you turn it that way up
you press it on now
it is isn't it
oh that's not a good idea mixing those two colors together
because then you won't willn't have white anymore
and you won't willn't have any red
you'll just have pink
shall i show you what happens if you mix red with white
look
there's some red
there's some white
i'm just going to mix them up
see what happens
you see the white disappearing and the red is going pink
isn't it
it's changed color
it's not stayed red anymore and it's certainly not white
you see
it's changed color
what're you making
oh
what do you mean do it
we don't really need any more pink
actually if we want pink we've got this pink haven't we
what are you doing
whoops
it's come off
what you need to do is squash it with your fingers like this
squash squash squash
what're you going to make with your pink piece when you've made it
shall we mix
where is that piece that you started making pink
shall we finish it off
mix it in with mummy's pink
add a bit more white
okay
well we don't want to add too much
because once we've run out of white that's it
we've run out of white
we haven't got any more
have we got the wiggly worm maker in here
oh i think we have
i've got half of it
there's the other half
there's some more
a
here they come
want some white ones
put the white in
put it in
that's it
they'll come out pink to start with and then they'll turn white gradually
okay
well make sure you do it over the mat
pink
oh they're starting to come through white now some of them
look
can you see that
that's clever isn't it
there are those wiggly worms pink and white
well do make sure
now you're dropping them on the carpet
do make sure you don't drop things
pick that off my skirt
right
just hang on there a sec
don't move
i'm going to get some
right warren
before we do any more we're going to move the table
just stop a minute
stop please warren
because look
you're spraying bits all over
warren
are you listening
stop
put those down please
right
just leave them for a minute
yes yes
yes
you can do that again in a minute
i'm just putting this down on the carpet
you won't willn't be popular if you got bits of soft stuff all over it
okay
now leave it
let mummy move the table back
right
there we go
okay
you can carry on with what you were doing now
that bit goes in there like that
look at those long worms
they're really long aren't they
are you going to mix them
why are you breaking them
oh right
this is actually quite a good way of mixing colors you know if you keep making them into worms
no
daddy can answer the phone
move it over the table
shall i help you get it the right way round
that's it
that's it
look at those
can mummy just have a little play
look at these wiggly wiggly worms
wiggly wiggly worms
do you know what they're like
they're a bit like a horse's tail aren't they
clip
oh you've got it on the floor
good job i put this mat down
we don't normally play with them in here do we
they're getting very pink aren't they those worms
oh no
they're tangled up worms i think now
are they
why are they better
may be what
difficult
yeah
if you put too much in it is hard isn't it
you're being very sensible and careful aren't you
byebye worms
we'll see some more worms though won't willn't we in a minute
look at those
no
they're not
they're good worms those
do you want to try a different shaped worm
we've got some different shapes we can use
instead of lots of little worms we can make one big worm
we can make a square worm
shall we try making a square one
there we go
whoops
let's pull off these bits of dough here
and put some here
put them in there
where's the rest
okay
you feed those in there then
squash the worms
want to add some pink
some red
that's enough
oh a little bit more
okay
shall we make a big square worm now
are you going to do it
that's a funny shape
can you see how it's square
and it's very long
the whole section is square isn't it
that
we could do a star shape
we could do that star shaped one if you like
have a go at doing the star shaped one
is it
oh yes
hold out your hand
take this one off then
do you want to make the star again
or do you want to make wiggly worms
which shape do you want to make
which is the flower shape
isn't that lovely
it's a good little flower isn't it
can mummy have a go at making one
no
i'll just use this piece
i'll just use this piece thank you
no
i just want this one for the moment thank you
it's your soft stuff after all isn't it
not mine
i like the pink we've made
let's see
oh that's lovely
look
i've made a star
where's your star

ugh
that's your nose print
now now now
just be gentle with it
course you can sit on my knee
what're you doing
oh i see
i think that bit was too small wasn't it really
you need a bigger bit
that's more like it
no
it's still maybe still not quite big enough
you need quite a big piece to make that car don't you
try not to mix too much white and pink red together
is it
oh right
right
i'm gonna going to make some more worms
i like making worms
do you
that's right
but i'm making worms

that's all the red there is
the rest is pink
i don't really think we want to make everything pink do we
look at those long worms

because you're just being giddy with them now aren't you
no
you're being giddy and foolish
be careful where you put your feet warren because you're just standing on them
aren't you
you're being foolish
i think i'll put the worm maker away
we could cut some shapes couldn't we
right
we'll put these
this isn't very good for cutting out
okay
this play
so i'll put this play away
we'll get out the other stuff shall we
pink and the yellow
because that's good for modeling
because this stuff isn't very good
it's too crumbly isn't it
it keeps falling apart
with this yellow
well do you want to make worms again
or are you going to do some rolling out and cutting
right
okay
do it on the
shall i put the little mat back up on the table
okay
there's a little bit more yellow
there's your rolling pin
where are some shapes
hey
you're getting good at rolling out aren't you
you're being very careful though
what is that animal
what is it
do you know
what creature it is
what creature that is
it's a hippo
hip hippo
course you can
oh
the whole joblot comes out
oh
this is better stuff isn't it
it doesn't crumble as much
there
should i put a big dollop there for you
do you think that'll be enough
you can roll that out first
well roll it out with two hands
let me just
i'll hold this still
you roll it out with two hands on the rolling pin
press on a bit harder if you can
that's it
what're you going to cut out
another hippo or a different creature
oh
two hippos
one very fat hippo and one normal hippo
that one was so fat it's not even cut out is it
not properly anyway
okay
there you go
then you've got more you see for cutting out more creatures
more shapes
maybe some vehicles
is that a good idea
oh yes
well have a look in the box for a prodding stick then
excellent
that's a good old prodding stick
why don't you pick it up and turn it the other way and prod it out the way you normally do
okay
turn it the other way up and prod it out the way you normally do because that's successful isn't it
that won't willn't prod it out
that'll just shove it in further
prod it out that way
that's it
do you know what hippos like doing warren
they like lying in rivers where it's cool
because they live in very hot countrys
well come to think of it i don't think you've ever seen a hippopotamus
well they don't live generally here
what have you got
oh your favorite
what is it
you like lions don't you
yeah
you roll it out
no
turn it that way and do some more rolling
no
hold the pin that way
hold the rolling pin that way
you're not squashing this one down
use the rolling pin then it's flat
i don't know what to do with you
i tell you something
you're much better with the rolling pin than you were last time you played with this
much better
well flatter than it was
why did you bang on top
it's not naughty to bang it
why are you banging it
is it so it'll be cut out properly
it's not because you like making a horrible noise or anything
hooray
what do you need then
what
i don't think so
whose birthday is it
is it
well it is mummy's birthday next
okay
one two
let's count
oh that was a wet blow
i wonder if mummy's birthday cake will have candles on it this year
well i need more than three candles pet
oh no
we'll keep that white out because these don't mix up with this dough
oh look
there's some on the carpet
going to have to go round with the vacuum cleaner i think and pick up all these bits
oh no
more work for mummy
oh no
more work for mummy
help help
i can't get you off me

that's fallen apart hasn't it
roll it out
is there something we can use as a
right
let's see if there's something we can cut round to make a good cake shape
that's too big
that's probably too small to fit in
oh no
it probably should be all right
right
can i borrow the prodding stick please
right
we're making a cake shape
see how i'm cutting
that's going back in your tea set
right

how many candles are you going to have on your next birthday cake
that's right because you're going to be three years old
because you're two and three quarters at the moment
how old are you
two and three quarters
who are the buckets of water for
probably keep sneaking more mouthfuls in when i'm not looking
we went to devon didn't we
no
where did we go
no
that was the last holiday
a long time ago
we went to barnstaple
you keep saying that we're going back to barnstaple don't you
you sit on the little toy train and say i'm going to barnstaple
now why is your garage parked on top of your vehicles
that's a funny place for a garage isn't it
shall we get it down
the garage that at christmas time becomes baby jesus's stable
it was actually baby jesus's stable first but there we go
actually warren calls it a shed don't you
yeah
has it broken down
why is it broken down
oh for broken down cars
and vehicles
right
well they're not getting much money in are they because there's no broken down vehicles in it
shall i translate that as broken down land rover
oh right
is the chappie going to come out and mend it
what's he going to do to mend it do you think
pardon
oh put it on the break on there
right
will it fit on there
yeah
it might do
why don't you try
that's right
shall we see if the land rover can drive up onto here then
reversing off
oh it kind of stays on there doesn't it
it's a bit big really
has it been taken away to be mended
could this man not mend it
a broken down lady
let's have a look for a broken down lady
i don't know if you've got a broken down lady actually
have you
oh is this the broken down lady warren
i've never seen her before
is that the little broken down lady
oh
oh yes
a what on top
a cherry on top
right
is this the broken down lady then
yes
is she going to drive the lorry
will she fit in
oh she will won't willn't she
shall we get her out
don't lean on the top because it might just break the transporter
oh she doesn't want to come out does she
she's waving goodbye to the land rover i think
what's wrong with the land rover
what bit's broken
what needs mending
oh right
is there a hole in the wheel
right
why not
whoops
oh is it a sleepy horse
that's a good place for a sleep isn't it away from all the noisy vehicles
except
the noisy rhino's going to come and wake the horse up
is it not
oh right
is it going to be a quiet rhino tiptoeing past
okay
tiptoe
that's a funny place for a rhinoceros
well what is it then
okay
i was just sort of holding it
i wasn't intending to put it on the car transporter
tiger actually
grr
shocker
don't know where you picked that up from
no
he won't willn't fit anyway
he's too small too big
yeah
the baby tiger would certainly fit on there
but i don't know where the baby tigers are
did the baby tigers go on holiday with us
i think they did didn't they
oh yeah
that shouldn't be in your vehicle box should it
my goodness
don't have irons in the vehicle box
now what's happened to this bus
that's better
yes
what's wrong with them sitting on the bench
they're having a little rest because they've been working hard mending cars all morning
oh right
yes
okay
next to the horse
what about the little girl
the ice lady
where's she going to go
do they not
no
oh they do
no
they don't
where is the little girl
no
she won't willn't will she
never mind
well she could sit on the grass couldn't she
that green bit there looks like grass doesn't it
she could sit there
and eat her ice
well she's got a picture of an ice on her jumper hasn't she
it might be magic ice
a magic picture on her jumper
oh that was clever
they've gone under the settee now
no
because they've gone right to the wall at the back
i can see something peeping out
i can see your motorbike under the settee
you can probably reach
no
i can't reach them because they're right at the back of the settee
well you can't have them darling because you've pushed them under the settee
you could have a coast man
get his helicopter out
he could go and rescue some people
where are the rotor
yeah
here you go
because coast go out and rescue people who are stuck on boats in the sea
it is isn't it
he's going to jump into this helicopter quickly so it doesn't get him
why don't you stop the rotor while he climbs in
that's it
then he can go off and rescue some people
that's a good idea
to take the rotor off
yeah
that's a good idea
who's he going to go and rescue
oh
oh right
he's just checking that everything's working like those ambulance people we saw the other day
oh my
i hope he's not hurt
the ambulance came just in case he was hurt and had to go to hospital
well that was a beautiful spin wasn't it
that span really well
whoops
well it is really isn't it
it looks like there's been a big accident
if you put everything standing up it'll just look as if they're parked rather than crashed
i'm watching
oh yes
i get the idea
the key should be in here somewhere so we can wind it up but i don't know where
there it is
what's the matter
right
now you have to hold it down like that and keep the wheels still while you turn it
no
wrong way
turn it that way towards the front of the engine
right
are you going to let go
that's bertie
i think i'm sitting on thomas
it won't willn't go on the floor now
you'll have to wind him up again
well you have to make sure the wheels are on the ground
right
you keep turning
okay
i'll sit by gordon
right
here's gordon
here am i
right
send it to me now
then i can send it back
oh
right
send me the key
oh thank you
wind it up
one two three four five six seven eight
it has
why don't you send it back to me
it's a bit wild isn't it that engine
the wrong way
that's it
hooray
oh thank you
thank you
shall we see how far it'll go
can you move the car transporter as well
we'll see if it can go onto the
okay
that was a long one wasn't it
no
it's run out of steam
shall i give you the key
is there
oh there's not enough to make it work though is there
that was a good steamy noise wasn't it
send it back
right
okay
it's a bit keen to go isn't it
a bit like thomas when he goes out of the station so quickly that he leaves his guard behind doesn't he
when he leaves his guard behind
obviously not
is it
now that was something out of you've been framed i think
careful
this train's going to go
okay
it has
thank you
you'll go far with that patronizing tone
i know
i'm not a very good shot am i
oh well done
that's gone under the settee
pull the settee back in case there's anything unspeakable in there
i don't think there is
oh are you
oh dear
are you poorly
suck this thermometer
let's see how poorly you are
suck this
oh
this poor little boy's very poorly
we need to get an ambulance
nee
now i wonder what the doctor thinks you need
let's find the doctor
here's the doctor
right
the doctor's going to give you a little prod and a feel to see how you are
prod
let's look into your eyes
what does the doctor say
oh do you know what the doctor says
the doctor says you ought to get out of your bed and start playing and you'll soon feel better
you're better now aren't you

oh yes
oh we'll need to keep safe hold of that thomas badge so we can put it in your badge bag to go with your holiday badges
if that policeman is in your mouth you'd better take it out
what's in your mouth

just your tongue
this was what you found was it

oh you'd blow them away would you

i don't know what state it's in
where's the badge

with a yellow roof
look at the panda's car
take it out
yeah
it was hidden wasn't it
it was hiding under that car
i don't know
you look for him
the man's a bit small
there's a problem with that man driving like that warren
he can't see where he's going
oh yes
shall we put them on
do you want to thread her legs in
i see you're about as accurate putting her pants on as you are putting your own on
right
there's one leg hole
right
thread the other leg through the other hole
no
we don't want two through the same hole warren
you do that with your shorts sometimes don't you
end up looking like a mermaid
is that better now she's got her pants on
there we go
have you found that panda yet
oh yes
it's just like your giraffe
well it's not a good idea to get yours out is it because it might get mixed up
that's a good noise
you obviously don't think so
but you've still not found that panda yet have you
i don't know
two men in a train
there should be some more men shouldn't there in here somewhere
oh look
here's a tiger like yours as well
is that a man
thank you
i don't know
it could go on the roof of the cab
there
they fit on nicely there don't they those three people
but she's already got a dress on
what's somewhere
there's that dress here
it's got a little fancy collar and lace
is that what you're looking for
a little blouse
well why don't you take it off
you undo it at the back
i'll hold her hair up
okay
you take it off
now is she just going to wear the trousers or is she going to wear the blouse underneath
right
let's thread her in
right
just let me do her blouse up
a blouse is like a shirt warren
her right foot and
if that's her right foot which foot's that
no
right foot and
left foot
where's your left foot
um where is your left foot
where's your left foot
yeah

right knee
right ear

that's left ear
left foot
left leg
left hand
left arm
left ear
left eye
left nostril
i don't think it was
i think it was in the tree outside
we need to get some more nuts don't we for that bird
mind you they don't eat many nuts in summer
perhaps we'll go out this afternoon and find some nuts for the birds
shall we go shopping this afternoon
we could go to wellington couldn't we
to buy some nuts
and there's something else we need as well
i can't remember what it is
something else exciting like bird nuts
maybe actually if we go to wellington we might be able to buy one of those very strong bird feeders
made of metal and wood
it'll last longer than those little bags
although there aren't many squirrels here
i've not seen any squirrels
we had to have a strong bird at home didn't at our last house didn't we
because the squirrels came and ripped those bags apart
i've not seen any squirrels here
have you
no
oh no
what can we do
get you up
oh what a heavy boy
you keep falling off
oh i can't
you're too heavy
i can't pull you up
dolly's going to help
you are too heavy
i'll just have to leave you like that
that's a shame because you can't eat your punch if you're lying like that
can't have your ham sandwich or your spreaded cheese sandwich
oh
now why have you suddenly sat up
is it the thought of lunch
good
though how you can want lunch after several cakes i don't know
what kind of animals are they looking for
eerrgh
eerrgh
that elephant's cheeky isn't it
eerrgh
you woke up last night didn't you and cried because your elephant had fallen out of bed
do you remember that warren
do you remember crying and saying i want my elephant
and i came up and said your elephant's about six inches away from the edge of your bed
why can't you get him
and you said no
mummy get him
i want my elephant
a softie mummy got the elephant for you of course
watch it
the panda might jump in
oh no
the panda's fallen out
poor panda
well his legs because his legs are a bit stiff aren't they
do you want your nose wiping
you're disgusting
i'm gonna going to get a tissue anyway
i shall attack you with it
where's your snozzle
why is it parked up
is the driver having his lunch
or a cup of tea
oh is that to let the sunshine in
oh
it's just to let the rain in
is it because he's hot
why is the top of his cab open then
right
oh right
well it's a good idea to have your cab closed if it's raining
it's like those cars without lids that you see
they normally put their lids back on if it starts to rain
no
i don't think it did rain yesterday
did it rain when we were on holiday
yeah
it did didn't it
it rained nearly every day
and do you remember warren
going to see all those tractors and engines in the mud
do you remember that muddy field
and you wore your wellies
and mummy and charlie wore sandals and they got very muddy bare feet
and we went stamping in puddles
do you remember
and the tractors had to rescue some of the vehicles because they were stuck in the mud
do you remember seeing that tractor pulling that very old fire
it was stuck in the mud
it did pull very hard and they were throwing straw everywhere weren't they so the cars wouldn't get stuck
and you listened to the music playing
you and charlie stood and listened to the music
oh dear
are your feet stuck in the mud
is it hard work
no
pushing not a good idea
shall i get coupled up to you then
and then we can both pull can't we
right
i'm coupled on
there we go
we're out of the mud
we're uncoupled now
are you stuck
i am stuck
but i just coupled onto you and pulled you out of the mud
why have you gone back in the mud
do i need to couple on or can i just push
well i'll pull because that's safer
give me your hands little stuck engine and i'll pull
buffers actually
not arms
pull poor little stuck engine
pull
pull you out of the mud
oh no
your trousers
what shall we do with you warren
that's a funny noise
warren
you're mad
