the fox was on his way home too
good night said percy as they passed each other
good night percy answered the fox
the fox had hiccups
the fox had been drinking some fizzy lemonade
when a squirrel told him a funny joke about a parrot a worm and a cricket bat
the fox exploded with laughter
it was then that he had learnt that it was not a good idea to laugh and drink at the same time
he had had hiccups all afternoon
i wonder if percy knows a good cure for hiccups
the fox said to himself
said i'll ask him he said
and with that he turned and followed after percy
when he got back to his hut percy remembered that he still had one or two jobs to do
first he watered some plants

and a pile of toast and soldiers
the fox hurried on
he wasn't afraid of the dark
he just liked the light better that's all
but where was percy
he ran round the side of the hut
but instead of finding percy
he found percy's washing
look
look
he's run in to all of his washing
there was a crash and a tumble which hurt his foot
he fell in a pile of flower pots

are you gonna going to be a good boy
you can't what
are you
why
are you
you're too scared to go on a hot air balloon
why is that
why are you scared
you don't like them
who went on a hot air balloon
where have you seen that
oh right
did she
who did she go with
eddie the
did she go with eddie
i
pardon
because he was too heavy wasn't he
that's why it wouldn't work
yeah
but maisy went with cyril didn't she
did she go with cyril the
and how about tallulah
did tallulah go
she was scared was she
oh
was maisy scared
no
and eddie wasn't scared
did charlie go on it as well
no
but
but you're scared
why are you scared
does it go too high
okay
well you don't have to go on one
we never said you had to go on a balloon ride
on a hot air balloon
have you
do they
you're almost finished haven't you
was he
what charlie
but charlie's a crocodile isn't he
was he
oh
i thought cyril
eddie the would be too heavy
he's really big isn't he
yeah
no
eddie's too big
no
i think what it was was
was it because there was um
other people in the hot air balloon
so charlie decided to get out so that eddie would be able to go for a ride because there was only room for one other person if eddie was in the balloon
there was only room for one other person if eddie was in the balloon
and that other person was maisy
so that's why everybody else had to get out didn't they
but otherwise they'd probably all be able to get in the balloon together
but because eddie's an elephant there's not a lot of room
was there
have you finished it
oh clever boy
well done

what can you see
a spider

let me have a look
does it go attach on this one
yes
and how about that one there
look
that one there
no
that one
that's it
does that go under here
yeah
i think that one will probably go down
move out the way a minute
i think something goes like this
you see
go like this
so you need a piece that goes there
but this one will go down here
look
move out the way
it doesn't fit
you need to find pieces that that put in place and keep it together
that will go there
and this one i think you'll find
goes there
there's lots of missing pieces isn't there
look
there's one two three four five six seven eight nine ten missing pieces

most dinosaurs just love to play
they hide and seek both night and day
they're playing aren't they

but many of them are so very tall
they find it hard to hide at all

there we go
this dino makes her tail go thump

no wonder that she's often grumpy
this baby dino's all alone
has mummy left him on his own
oh no his mum just heard him cry
soon she'll roar a lullabye
ay
why is it crying
because he doesn't know where his mummy is
there here she is
if someday you hear a roar
don't think that it's a dinosaur

can you do this one
you know this one's really hard
it is it's got sixty pieces
is it not
do you think you can do it
you can try
you gonna going to try and do this
it might take you a long time though
oh very good
that one goes there doesn't it
i don't know
no that does that's not right is it
no
i don't know
maybe we'll we'll have to see in a minute
maybe there's another piece that goes in between
and it doesn't quite look right does it
yeah
it's not quite right is it
that does go there
yeah
that's correct
you
that's right
who says correct
does grandad say that
correct
yeah
that's right
and this goes here
oh very good fraser
there are lots of pieces there's three jigsaws here
one
oh very good
well done fraser
yeah
see if we can fit them all together and get this done
do you think we can do it
look at all these pieces
i'll spread them all over the floor and then you can see all the pieces can't you
oh well done
that does go there
you're welcome
is that right
oh yes
that fits doesn't it
um i thought i saw a bit of leg here
that's that's his foot isn't it
but we might have to find
oh here you go
have you tried
oh no
are those wendy's legs
i'm not quite sure
oh
this is going to be hard this isn't it
do you think it's really hard this
yeah
that's pilchard's tail isn't it
oh look what you've done there
i don't know
i don't know
we'll have to work it out in a minute won't we
it might be off a different puzzle because
oh no
he's only in one picture
so
well let's see
let's have a look
which way does his tail go
i think it goes that way
is that right
no fraser
hold on
let's have a look
i tell you what
do you know what
this goes there
like that
oh i know
it goes like that
look
that goes on there
wow
look at that
that's ten pieces
now we need to find his tummy don't we
where's bob's tummy
you alright
no
that's not his tummy
just
trying to see
where all these pieces go
no
i think
maybe try there
that's it
does that piece go there
that piece goes there doesn't it
and this piece
do you think this piece goes on there
if you look for quite big pieces they seem to be the ones that fit that puzzle
no
try this side
oh
i think it goes there
that's it
oh you've broken it fraser
are you gonna going to fix it again
it goes there
did you break it again
oh fraser
oh that's it
no
that i'd say that goes there doesn't it
that's his arm
that's his face
okay
see if that will fit somewhere
we don't know where yet
maybe
um how about this piece
do you think this piece goes somewhere
that's a big piece isn't it
looks like these pieces are big pieces as well
look
and that piece looks like a big piece
and that piece looks like a big piece too
does this go
that definitely goes on there
no it doesn't fit there
it goes on here
that's it
and this piece will go there
so we have to find pieces that go in between there
ah
like this one
look
that's it
that's not quite right then is it
ah
here we go
look
it goes like that
that's better
isn't it
where does that one go
oh well done
clever boy
yeah
that's right
no
oh yeah
i think you're right
well done
clever boy
where does this one go do you think
no
i think it goes on the other side
i think it goes over there
that's it
what about that one
i think it goes like that
that's it
well done
can see which pieces we're looking better for now
that's better isn't it
no
i think that's a different one
this might go somewhere
do you think this goes somewhere maybe
i don't know
it might not
er no
i don't think it does actually
i think it's part of a wheel isn't it
no that's wrong
that's not right
i can't see more pieces at the moment can you
no
i think
alright we'll put that over there for the moment
i'm not sure where the other pieces are
so shall we try and do some of these ones
oh this is a hard one isn't it
they're getting smaller now
that's that's the thirty two piece ones
now we've got the two big ones to do now
yeah
i think so
i think it's scoop as well
right
this is part of wendy
right
ah
there we go
no that's not right either is it
what am i doing
there
let's see if we can find some more of this checkered shirt
she's wearing a
bit like a green checkered shirt isn't she
so
it doesn't go there
there's lots of bits of scoop isn't there
is the yellow one scoop
is that
that's scoop isn't it
right let's see if we can do it like this then
that's scoop's face isn't it
oh
that fits doesn't it
that bit fits
i think that's a different a different part of his face
i think that one goes in that puzzle there with wendy
oh this must be the really small one
this is a sixty piece one
yeah
that's little scoop isn't it

you said they eat leaves
and then
it says
tyrannosaurus rex was the biggest meat eater ever
if it were alive today it could peer at our upstairs windows

we've not seen those ones before
struthiominus they're called
struthiominus

a diplodocus

that's a stegosaurus
and it says perhaps stegosaurus was cold blooded and used the spiny plates on its back to soak up the sun's heat in the early morning
that's the sun coming up

what's on it
what's on it
it's it's a tree on it
and um something red crawling up it
i think it goes over here maybe
do you think it goes here
maybe
let's put some more pieces in and then we'll be able to find out won't we
oh it does go there
that's good
what do think he's b so where's he gonna going to go and hide
can you see he's looking with his big eyes
he's going ssh
he's gonna going to go and hide in the tree
can you see
that's right
he's running up here
he's going i'm gonna going to go and hide
hides in the tree
and then he's running
to say hello to the mice
right
what other pieces have we got
there look
that's that's a good bit to put in isn't it
what's missing from there
is it another pterodactyl
do you think
we've put the pterodactyl in
what else is over there that's flying
do you think it's some other sort of bird
oh
what are they
i've never seen them before

they're funny little things aren't they
have you seen a bug in real life
er one two three four five they've got six legs
so they've got less legs than the spi
oh
can you see someone else hiding
what's what's he hiding behind
you know what
he doesn't bite does he
is it a spike tree
but you know what fraser
i think that he's looking for his baby
and i think that this is his baby
look
what do you think
do you think
i think that's mummy and baby
and he's behind there and he's crying he's lost his baby
aah
he's all the way over there isn't he
come on then
where does that go
right
how many pieces have we got left now
one two three four five
oh
up there

i've never seen so many dinosaurs in my whole life
they're lovely aren't they
oh fraser
look where your hands are
did you burn your hand on the volcano
on the lava
aah
yeah
it's hurting now is it
aah
let's have a look
let's have a look
have you burnt your hand on the lava

you have to blow and cool it down
that's it
do you think i did it as well
oh
and then i just go to put my hand down and look
ah
and the spiky bush again
right
come on then
we're nearly finished
i think it might go over here

and what's this dinosaur running away from
her
and who's she

don't you
he might get spiked
is he not
well that's good
where's he gonna going to hide
maybe he's gonna going to hide up here

are they gonna going to hide in the orange grass
the eggs are a bit hidden in the orange grass over here

what's it got on the front
a cat and a mouse
and this says the opposites book
so it means things that are opposite
so it says look
the mouse is
small
and the cat is
big
that's right
he is compared to the mouse isn't he
they're called chalk and cheese
they're eating
cheese

isn't he
he's going like that look
and what's this
this is up and
down that's right
that's opposite
chalk runs up the cat's black leg
and cheese slides down its white tail
so that's opposite as well
that's black and white
and he's going up and he's going down
it is isn't it
that's right

you see
in front
behind
that's right
see i'm holding this book in front of me
or i'm hiding the book behind me
oh this is slow and
because they're hiding from the cat
maybe the cat's chasing them
do you think the cat's chasing them
he is
he's scaring the mice isn't he
the cat is old and slow
chalk and cheese are young and quick
is that it
or is there one more page

you gonna going to read that one
that's an opposite one as well
that's scruffy teddy's book of opposites
it's opposites as well
it says sad and
happy
that says sad

what's this one
it says big and
little
that's right
yes
that's right
that's right
big and little
that's right
that's a patch
yes
that's right

yeah turn the other page
off and
on
he's taking his hat off
and he's put his hat on again

so he slipped and fell into a puddle and got all wet
he's all cold and wet now

that's right
you and me went on it didn't we
yeah

did i
and then we went on lots some more rides
we did
it was fun at legoland wasn't it
did you like legoland
yeah that was good wasn't it
was there
wow
yeah
wow
yeah you wanted to go with mummy
and did you go with mummy

that's right
that was the big slide wasn't it
at legoland
so you well da da wanted to go with daddy as well didn't he
but you hadn't had a turn with daddy yet had you
so you sat with daddy didn't you
and did you go on a blue one or a yellow one
do you remember
i think it was yellow wasn't it
no they didn't have any green ones
it was blue or yellow wasn't it
and then that
we sat on that little boat and then they pushed us off and you went down the slide didn't we
that's right
it went really fast didn't it
did you get a wet bum
oh dear me
and what else did we go in
we had something to eat there didn't we
we had pasta
yummy pasta wasn't it
did you not
yeah there was lots of fruitshoot wasn't there
no we didn't
we probably had some pepsi
pepsi
pepsi cola
no you wanted fruitshoot
you and had lots and lots of fruitshoot
and we stayed at auntie debbie's house didn't we and uncle kevin's
and did you sleep in a bedroom all by yourself with
yeah you had your own bedroom didn't you
did you not sleep very well
oh why's that
yeah you had been naughty hadn't you
you wouldn't go to sleep both of you would you
were you too excited
what darling
you want that book there
did he
did he
snappy little dinosaurs
shall we have a look at that book then
teradon
yeah lots of dinosaurs
do you want me to read it with you
oh what's happened here
who broke that
it was you
i'll bet
ah
oh you've broken it fraser
was it
i'll see if i can fix that later
okay shall we read it
it says if this were a zillion years ago think of the dinos you would know
now this is one who likes to munch in fact he eats ten trees for lunch
wow that's a lot of trees isn't it
he is look
he's eating there look
i know it's broken but he's still eating isn't he
isn't that a lot of trees to eat
it's
he eats ten trees fraser
that's a lot of trees isn't it
that's a triceratops
i know
what's this one
because he's twisting his neck so he can reach the top of the trees
it says most dinosaurs just love to play
they hide and seek both night and day
but many of them are so very tall they find it hard to hide at all
i bet it is hard to hide when they're that big
because that's the size that the are
they're just very very big because they're grown
they've eaten all their food up and they've grown up
that's why they're very big
yes
yeah he was a good dinosaur and ate all of his dinner up
do you eat all your dinner up
no
you won't grow up then
you have to eat all your food and grow up to be a big boy won't you
along the cliff above the shore there lives a flying dinosaur
gigantic wings help her to fly around the prehistoric sky
look that one's flying over there as well
no
why can't he fly
is he wet do you think
has he just been in the water
he looks a bit cold doesn't he
and looks like he's shivering
he needs a towel
that's right
and dry him off
ah what's this dinosaur here called
he has got lots of spikes along his back
pardon
the orange one
what did you say
it's a stegasaurus
that's right
he has
that's right
right
do whales eat dinosaurs
so why did you say he was watching out for sharks and dinosaurs and sharks and whales and crocodiles
oh didn't you
what did you say then
it says this youngster has a funny shape his spikes are sharp they make you gape
right now he's just a little one but he'll be huge at twenty one
because he's only little isn't he
he's only a little baby
that's right
and when he's older he'll be really big as well
when he gets big and eats lots of food and eats all his tea up and everything and he'll be really big as well
so if you eat all your tea up you'll be very big as well
you'll grow up to be a big boy
that's right
that's right
and if you eat your tea up you'll be big like daddy
and grandad
yeah
yeah grandma's not very big is she
well grandma's about the same size as mummy
isn't she
deep in the waters of the sea a dino swims around with glee
her tail goes splash her flippers flap her giant jaws shut with a
snap
that's right
and this is a
mosasaurus
what's the matter
because that's what they eat
because maybe it's like a shark because sharks eat lots of other fish as well
yeah
i think that's supposed to be a flower
i don't think it's supposed to be a hand
some dinosaurs can really run they race and make it look like fun
just watch their legs go to and
where's this one going do you know
do you know where it's going
where's it going
what's this one called
do you remember
oh clever boy
that's right
it's a velociraptor isn't it
ooh
here benith
er tsk here beneath the leafy shade these enormous eggs were laid
this seems to be a special batch
oh look a baby starts to hatch
sorry
it's just coming out now
it's just starting to come out
it's just starting to hatch
it's just poked a little bit out and it's slowly gonna going to break that egg so it can come out
on it's head
that's part of the shell
you know that toy that you've got downstairs with the dinosaurs and the egg
and you twist it round
that's what happened
and the top bit's always on top isn't it because he's just pushed his way out of the egg
he's not ready yet
maybe he's not ready yet
and this one's called a
do you remember what this one's called
good boy
the yellow one
this one
the triceratops
no it's not because he hasn't got he hasn't got horns like the triceratops does he
what's this one called
ankyloceratops
no ankylosaurus
yes
this dino makes her tail go thump
the noise is loud it makes you jump
because it's really loud
her skin is thick and very lumpy
no wonder that she's often grumpy
that's her tongue
i don't know
do you think she's scared
what's she scared of
or maybe she's cross
do you think she might be cross
oh what's this
this baby dino's all alone
has mummy left him on his own
oh no his mum just heard him cry
soon she'll roar him a lullabye
and do you know what this one is
if someday you hear a roar don't think that it's a dinosaur
for as you know and sad to say there are no dinosaurs today
not any real ones are there
no
no it's not a real one
is it
what about that dinosaur jigsaw downstairs
is that a good dinosaur
no but that do you remember that one downstairs that daddy made
that daddy made with
that one that stands up
do you remember that dinosaur
is that a naughty dinosaur
yeah
yeah
why was it naughty
did it hatch out
no it didn't hatch out like the protocerotops
daddy and made it because it was it's it's like um the bones inside the dinosaurs
it's called a skeleton
because inside most things there are bones
and that's what they look like if they've got no skin
can you see this here
see all this on you
this is called skin
and underneath your skin you've got bones
and that's that's what dinosaur bones look like
what's the matter
go on then
you play with that there then
your beads
quite fond of your beads at the moment aren't you
they're quite funny are they
why are they quite funny
did it
do you
sing it again
well that's a funny song
what songs do mummy's does mummy play in her car
what songs do you sing in mummy's car fraser
what songs do you sing in mummy's car

and he's come to fix their car
and he uses traffic cones like those probably and puts them around the car so that nobody comes near them
it's broken down
maybe it's got a flat tyre

oy loves you
she plays with you all the time doesn't she
excuse me come and put your pants back on
yeah well let's get your pants back on first
not a tuxedo
yeah little bill said that didn't he
what did he want to be
a ring bear
a ring bearer
that's what it is isn't it
and he thought he was going to be a ring bear
but it wasn't it was a ring bearer wasn't it
that's right
you're gonna going to do that one again
are you not gonna going to finish this one off
silly boy
did you forget that you hadn't done that one
you remember now
so what did you do with daddy when mummy went shopping
did you watch the telly
did you watch the football
oh who won
say england
they won today didn't they
do you
that's the penguin one isn't it
let's have a look
it's got penguins
oh it's called the number floor puzzle
it says meet ben's friends and learn to count from one to ten
pardon
yeah you finish those ones off first
and then you can do that one afterwards if you like
pardon
did you
who was it
here mummy will do it
let go
yeah it was wasn't it
it's alright he's going now
he's got to go downstairs hasn't he
while we do this
the ring bearer
oh where can it be
you're gonna going to do what
no no no don't do that
come on let's do these jigsaw
because you you've still got two more to do
and then we can do that big one over there can't we
the number floor puzzle
yeah we can do that one next if you like
when you finish doing these ones
has it
oh where can it be
do you think got it
did take it
no
where is it
what are we gonna going to do
is that it
is that it behind your back
ah were you hiding it all this time
oh what a cheeky little boy you are
are you cheeky
why has it fallen out
well i'll tell you why
because look can you see this sign here
that red triangle means it's it's like a danger sign
and what it's saying there is
can you see that zigzag line
it means that the road has got lots of curves
it's like a zigzag
so maybe the lorry was being naughty and he was driving too fast
then when he went round the corner he tipped over didn't he
and all his vegetables have fallen out and these rabbits have come along and they're eating it aren't they
so that's why you mustn't drive very fast
especially when there's red triangles like that
when you see signs like that then they're warning signs
where's it gone now
i don't know
where's it gone
is it behind your ear
is it in your mouth
no
is it
i know is it in your socks
no
is it under your shirt
no
where can it be
i don't know where it is
are you hiding it in your hair
no
is it not on your head somewhere
oh there it is
i can see it
you're sitting on it
shall we put that last piece in then
there we go
oh
can you see that sign there
that says sharp corner
you see
so that man wasn't careful was he
he was driving too fast he went round a sharp corner and he tipped over
that man there
he was the one that was driving it
right next one
let's do the next one
hosepipe
they're the what
pipes
they're called hosepipes though
no they're called hosepipes because pipes
are hard
pipes the ones that i meant are plastic and things like that and they're they take water and lots of things but hose
well sorry the hosepipes but hosepipes are soft
well they're not always soft are they
they can be hard as well
you get a gardening hose those are hard
those are made out of hard plastic
you know with we use that hosepipe when we're putting water in your paddling pool
that's a hosepipe as well
and these that the firemen have got they're hosepipes as well
because they put out fires
that's right
they rescue people's houses that are burning
they go and put the fires out and they use those hosepipes and they burn they
tsk they use the water to put the fire out
there's pipes in the house as well fraser
not hosepipes like that but pipes in the house in the walls
because they take water
like you know the ones in the sink
and then when we run the bath
it needs pipes to take water from the tanks to the taps
because up in the attic up in the loft there's a big water tank up there
yeah there's a water tank in the attic
and also there's pipes in the street as well that bring water to the house and bring water away from the house as well
why
well because they bring water away
they they bring water in that's clean so we can use it to wash and do the dishes and have showers and use the toilet
and to drink as well
well we need you need to drink to live don't you
if you don't drink you'll be thirsty
and then you need pipes to take all the dirty water away as well
i think there's a tape downstairs that we've got
you know auntie mabel and pippin
i think there's a program about sewage
it tells you all about water and pipes and things like that
and dirty things
yeah
it tells you all how they all about how they clean the water and things like that
yeah there's toilets as well
and baths and sinks
and you'll see where all the water goes
they go to big sewage plants and there's loads and loads of water
big huge tankfuls of water
it tells you how they clean the water
hey there's two pieces missing
is there
oh no
it had to happen didn't it
we couldn't have a puzzle where there wasn't any pieces missing could we
are you hiding them
nope they're really missing aren't they
oh well
maybe they're in another jigsaw box somewhere
maybe
right we'll put that one there
we've got two missing pieces
one two three missing pieces i think
not four
that's right
where can they be
no there's only four
one two three four
don't know
there they are
there's one of the pieces
so now there's only three missing pieces
tadah
and now there's only two missing pieces
can you do a tadah
can you do another one and get the other missing piece
tadah
oh no there's no missing pieces now is there
no
it doesn't work anymore does it
no
shall we do this last one then
go on then
you do it
i don't know
we'll have to do the puzzle and find out won't we
i don't know
i don't know
the felt friends say that in blues clues
we don't know what they're saying though do we
yeah
maybe they're speaking spanish or something
we don't understand what they're saying do we
that's right
that's what they say
that piece doesn't go there does it
that's right
we'll have to write daddy's cards out soon as well
because it's fathers day tomorrow
yeah
why
because it is
and we'll have to write some cards out for daddy tomorrow won't we
we've written some cards out for grandad
and for great grandad
and we have to do daddy's
why
so we can give some cards to daddy for fathers day
no
mummys don't get cards on fathers day
mummys get cards on mothers day
mothers day's already been
yeah mothers day's already been
no it's not
not anymore
do you remember when it was mothers day on little on little bill
and he forgot his mothers day present didn't he
and he was sad because he had nothing to give to his mummy
very good
why is he sad
because he's fallen off his bike hasn't he
he's fallen off his bike and hurt his leg
yeah he was probably going too fast
and look he hasn't got a helmet on either has he
oh that's naughty isn't it
that's probably why he's hurt himself
wears a helmet when he goes on his bike doesn't he
well we hope not
we hope he doesn't fall and hurt himself
did you
when did you hurt yourself
oh
no it's all better now isn't it

i can help you count from one to ten
so let's take a walk down number street
there are lots of friends for you to meet
oh wow

come on then let's do this jigsaw
one two
that's right
no it only goes up to ten
one friendly lion having his lunch
we can't read this one because there's a piece missing isn't there
oh that's it
that's the piece for the ladybird isn't it
yeah they're being good aren't they

oh that's it
that's
that's the rest of the lion
and that's a caterpillar there
look he's eating
yeah
yeah
that's the spiders
because it's seven busy spiders spin their web
maybe he's tired
maybe he's had a very busy day
and now he wants to go to sleep
maybe they've already had a sleep
and they're busy working again
a mint
no
that's his nose
that's a rabbit isn't it
you think that's a mint do you
where do we get mints from
pizza hut
is he
oh
so maybe they are getting ready for school
pardon
how does he get some
well his mummy or daddy probably bought some from the shops
and then he goes into his bathroom and puts the toothpaste onto a toothbrush
just like does that for you in the morning doesn't he
that's what i just said
puts the toothpaste on your toothbrush for you in the morning doesn't he
and then in the evening mummy does it or daddy does it or does it when you have a bath
that's right
i'm not too sure
this one looks like it's the bigger one doesn't it
but then it's got a pink hat and men don't wear pink hats do they
maybe they're all girl penguins
because they've all got hats on haven't they
they've all got hats with flowers on
maybe they're all sisters
that's it
it goes there doesn't it
do you think so
do you think the elephant belongs underneath the rabbits
i don't think that's right
that's better
yeah that one goes there
that's right
who's silly
i think you're silly because you put them in the wrong place
that's it
well done
you want to do it again
shall we read it
let's have a look

if you help me put them away then we can get the other one out quicker
no if you put those rescue ones away then we can get the postman pat one out quicker
but there are pieces missing on the postman pat one as well
because that's an old one isn't it
so there's definitely pieces missing of that
i don't know
it's another one that's mixed up isn't it
what
we're not reading a thomas book are we
well we're gonna going to put these rescue ones away first
yeah don't do that fraser you'll break them
fraser
i said don't do that
you shouldn't stand on things like that
fraser i mean it
no
because you'll bend the pieces and you won't be able to play with them when you want to next time
no
put your foot down
fraser you're being naughty
right we'll not do the postman pat one then
no because you're being naughty
are you going to be a good boy
listen to what mummy says

in december we have christmas because that's when christmas is
and it's cold as well and there's snow

that's october
that must be when all the leaves are coming off the trees
can you see she's sweeping up all the leaves
and the leaves are all brown and red and yellow and golden aren't they
why is she sweeping them up
because otherwise it would make a mess wouldn't it
if they're all over the place
they've got to tidy them away
because if there's leaves all over the place you won't be able to do anything will you
and then they get in the drains and they clog the drains up as well
so she's sweeping them away
right
let's have a look
fireworks
oh this is

i don't think we've had fireworks
oh look at this

okay then
oh look at this
we've got quite a few pieces of

bird's mouth is called a beak
and he's going to build a nest
just like on the front of our house
well on the side of our house rather there's a bird's nest there and that's made out of twigs and grass and mud
so that little bird's going to build a nest

do we not
no that's the panther
that's bagheera
the panther's nice because he looked after the baby
he found the baby in the basket didn't he and he said i'll find someone to look after you
so he took the baby and left it outside the wolves cave
that's the mummy wolf isn't it
these are the baby wolves yes
so they're gonna going to look after him while he grows up
until he's a big boy
can you see
and now he's ten years old and he's still happy living with his wolf family
and he's tall and strong now
yeah that boy's
mowgli's big and strong now because he's ten years old
but he has to go back and live with other people because it's dangerous in the jungle because of that tiger
that tiger wants to come and eat him doesn't it
yeah it is
later on in the story
and this is the day when they all the wolf elders are having a meeting
no that's that's the um panther
that's bagheera
bagheera's nice
tigers have stripes don't they
and he doesn't have stripes does he
so they're saying that they have to take him back to the village because if they don't
because he wants to stay with his friends in the jungle doesn't he
because ever since he was a baby he's been living with all these animals
so he wants to stay with them
but he has to go and live with in the village with other people doesn't he
because otherwise that tiger will try and try and eat him
and the tiger will try and eat anyone who tries to help that little boy
where's the tiger
he's not here yet is he
see look
they're just having to tell the um panther now that he has to go back to the village with other people
and bagheera's saying he'll take him
look
bagheera's taking him on his back isn't he
but he doesn't understand
and he's gonna going to get upset
but he has to take him doesn't he
and look he's in the tree now
bagheera's er mowgli's lying asleep in the tree isn't he
and what's this that's coming out of the branches
it's a snake
hiss
and what does the snake do
look
he's wrapping himself around mowgli
because the snake wants to eat him as well
but bagheera comes and he hits him doesn't he
he swipes him with his big paw
can you see
he's gone like that and hit him with his paw
so that the snake will let the little boy go
and you see the next day they're playing
look oh what's
next morning mowgli and bagheera woke to hear a heavy thudding noise below them
he's swinging
no he's swinging because he can hear a noise
and it's a parade
it's an elephant parade
and he goes down
he swings on that vine so that he can see what's going on
and look at all these elephants marching
the baby elephant's here
look we turn the page
and ah look there's the baby elephant
and the baby elephant's marching as well isn't he
and he says you have to do what i do
so mowgli joins in and he pretends to do what they're doing
look he's got down on all fours as well
and he's marching with the elephants
but then the elephants turn around and then mowgli crashes into that baby elephant doesn't he
because he doesn't really know what they're supposed to be doing
and then look
that big elephant picks him up and he says what happened to your trunk
no boys don't have trunks do they
and he says why you're a man cub
i'll have no man cubs in my jungle
and then bagheera comes and he says that the little boy's with him and that he's taking him back to the village
bagheera the panther
and then look he's trying to pull mowgli to say right we've got to go back to the jungle er go and get to the village
but mowgli doesn't want to go does he
he wants to stay
so he's trying to hold onto that tree
so that he can't be taken away
and then bagheera gets cross and leaves him all by himself
but then a big bear comes and he makes friends with mowgli
and that big bear's called
baloo
that's right
no not blue
not as in the color blue
ba loo
baloo
no it's not blue it's baloo
baloo the
and he teaches him how to eat bananas and coconuts
and look they're playing on the river now aren't they
and mowgli's lying on baloo's tummy isn't he
and then they're gonna going to go to sleep
oh these naughty monkeys snatch him don't they
they grab him by the arm like that and they take him away
and baloo wakes up and says give me back my man cub
but the monkeys are just laughing aren't they
and they take mowgla mowgli away to where they live
where's
they've taken him away haven't they
and look there he is
and that's the king of the apes
he's called louie
king of the apes
and he wants to be like a little boy
so he wants he wants that little boy to teach him how to be like a man
and how to make fire
but he doesn't know because he's only a little boy isn't he
he doesn't know how to do things like that
and baloo and bagheera come to the temple
to look for mowgli
and then they can hear what king louie's saying
so he says we've got to rescue him
so baloo dresses up as a lady ape doesn't he
to try and distract the king
and he thinks that that's a woman ape
a lady ape because he's got a skirt on
and they're dancing and everybody's dancing aren't they
yes
and then what happens
his disguise his costume falls off doesn't it
and then he knows that it's baloo the
so they both try and run over to mowgli to try and take him away and rescue him
but then king louie grabs his arm as well doesn't he and they're fighting over him
because they both want him
because baloo is his friend and he wants to rescue him from the apes because the apes aren't very nice
oh and all the rocks are falling off now
and they're running away now
and mowgli's riding on bagheera's back and they run back into the jungle
oh dear
and then they're saying he must go back to the village
but he doesn't want to go does he
he's running away again isn't he
and then what happens
he's sad isn't he
and look
there's the tiger
and the tiger can hear what bagheera's saying to that elephant
because he's saying that they need help to find the little boy again
and the tiger's heard him now
but
oh dear
look who's found him now
the snake
hiss that's right
and he says go away and leave me alone
and then shere khan comes
and look he's pulling the snake's tail isn't he
and he says do you know where the little boy is
do you know where mowgli is
but he says that he hasn't got him because he wants to eat the little boy himself doesn't he
oy
and while they were doing that mowgli ran to hide
but he's sad now isn't he
and the vultures think he's funny so they start teasing him
but because he's so sad they feel sorry for him as well and they make friends with him
oh dear
but then the tiger comes along so the vultures have flown away
and they say run little boy run
but he didn't run away did he
he just sat where he was because he was so cross
and he says run why should i run
you don't scare me
and the tiger says i'll give you a chance
i'll count to ten
but mowgli didn't run away did he
so the tiger got cross and he jumped up in the air
and then suddenly
what happens
the vultures flew down and they picked him up to save him
and baloo's there as well
he's grabbed the tiger by the tail hasn't he
so that mowgli can escape
because baloo's his friend isn't he
ah
and then what happens
the lightning hits the tree doesn't it
and the vultures say fire is the only thing that will scare the tiger
so mowgli picks up one of the branches with the fire doesn't he
and he runs and picks up the branch and he goes back to where the tiger is
he's not on fire
he's what
he's um being scared
they're scaring him with the fire because the tiger doesn't like fire
so what they've done is they've taken the fire back so they can save their friends
they tied a branch to his tail
so when the tiger looked behind him he could see this fire on his tail so he's run away
oy dear
look baloo's lying down isn't he
and he's he's poorly
oy mowgli's upset and he says please get up
but the bear doesn't move does he
and it's starting to rain on him
oy poor bear
do you think he'll be alright
it's sad isn't it
ah but it's alright because mowgli starts crying and then all of a sudden bagheera arrives and baloo sits up and he says what's the matter
did someone say my name
and then they have a big cuddle together don't they
because he's alright now isn't he
and then they take him back to the man village
and then she he suddenly hears someone singing
and they have a look and who is it
oh it's a little girl
and mowgli says what's that
i've never seen one of them before
and baloo says oh they're trouble
forget about them
and look he's showing off now isn't he
he's gone to see what she's doing
he's put something on his head
yeah
and then as he goes into the village he waves goodbye to his friends
the end
ah
that's nice isn't it
because they live in the jungle because they're animals
so they have to go back to the jungle where they belong
and that little boy has to live in the village with other people because that's where he belongs with other people
because it's dangerous for little boys to live in the village
er to live with the animals in the jungle
it's like that tiger that was trying to eat him
so he's got to be with other people
so they can look after him and protect him
are they scary
well that one's not scary
bagheera's not scary
bagheera's the panther that looks after him
he's naughty isn't he
that's king louie
king louie rules the monkey kingdom and wishes to learn the secret of man's red fire
because he was trying to rescue him
he wanted to keep him
the monkey wanted to keep that little boy for himself didn't he
and baloo was trying to rescue him
he was trying to save him
so that
well because king louie wanted to keep mowgli for himself
and baloo wanted to take mowgli back to the village
where he belongs
but louie wanted to keep him for himself and that's not right is it
but why all the animals in
because he wanted to stay with all his friends
because they were like his mummy and daddy
the wolves that looked after him were like his mummy and daddy because they brought him up from when he was a tiny baby
that's the end isn't it
and that's the jungle book
did you like that book
there's two the ends
well all it is it's telling you who's in the book
yeah
these are the goodies and these are the baddies
that's right
yeah
why are they bad
oh no he's not nice
that tiger wants to eat mowgli
yeah it's not very nice if you eat little boys is it

bambi
how about
hundred and
you just want to read the jungle book
is it
yeah those are the baddies aren't they
and these are the good ones aren't they
what's his name
courtney
mogli
and what's his name
and what's his name
tiger
no
that's bhagira
that's right
so
what happens
oh what happens on the first pa what happens
on the first page
bhagira the panther finds a little boy
all by himself in a basket doesn't he
and he says oh i'll have to find someone to look after you
and then on the next page what do we see
bhagira's left the baby outside a cave
where a wolf family live
and the mother wolf looked in the basket
and she smiled and says oh it's a man cub
because that's what they call him a man cub
because he's a baby
he's inside the basket isn't he
and baby animals are called cubs
so they call him a man cub
and he she says oh he needs looking after
i'll look after him until he's
grown up to keep him safe
that's mogli's
um wolf daddy
because these wolves looked after him while he was a baby
until he grew up
and now he's ten years old
and he's got lots of animal friends
and he likes to live in the jungle
but they say that one day he's got to go back to the village doesn't he
because he's got to go and live with other people
because he can't live with animals
all the time
especially when there's a tiger coming
because they can they've heard that there's a tiger
around the jungle
so they all have a big meeting
and they say he must go back to the village where he'll be safe
so bhagira says i will take him back to the village
so there he is
mogli's on the back of bhagira
and they're going back to the village
so that the tiger can't get to him
ah and then they go to sleep in the trees don't they
then what happens
pardon
yeah a snake comes doesn't it
and what does the snake want to do
it wants to eat him doesn't it
so look he's wrapped himself round the little boy
but then bhagira comes
and he swipes the snake with his big paw
and the sn the snake lets him go
and then the next morning
he hears a noise
his he he can hear the elephants that are
that that are marching
so he grabs hold of a vine
and he swings on the vine
so he can have a closer look
and look there they are
there's the elephants marching
that's another elephant
no
these aren't the baby ones
these are the big ones that are marching
and behind them is a little baby elephant
and mogli says what are you doing
and the little baby elephant says we're marching
and he and he tells mogli to just do what they do
yeah well they're marching
so he gets down on all fours just like the elephants doesn't he
and he marches
but then they all turn around and they
bump into each other don't they
because mogli didn't know that he was supposed to turn around
and he kept on going
so they bumped into each other
oh and then what happens
oh the big elephant picks mogli up
and he says
what does he say
yeah what happened to your trunk
and he says why you're a man cub
i'll have no man cub in my jungle
and then bhagira comes and he says that he's taking the little boy back to the village
and then bhagira says right
we've got to get going now
we've got to go back to the village
but he doesn't want to go does he
so bhagira gets cross and says
right you're on your own
and then he makes friends with a bear doesn't he
it is a nice bear isn't it
it's his friend isn't it
that's baloo the
that's right
and they go and find bananas and coconuts
and sit and eat them don't they
and then they go and play in the river to cool down
and they're going to go to sleep now aren't they
mogli goes to sleep on baloo's belly
and then what happens
the naughty monkeys grab hold of him don't they
and they take him away
back to their king
and baloo wakes up and gets cross
and he says give me back the boy
but they just laugh
and they take mogli away
to where they live
no
they grab him by the arm
and they take him away back to their home
that's naughty isn't it
and there is the louis king of the apes
and louis wants to be like a human
and he wants mogli to teach him
how to do things like people do
but mogli doesn't know
because he he's lived with animals all his life
and he's only a little boy as well
so he can't tell him what to do can he
but then baloo and bhagira come to the temple
to look for mogli
and they hear the king saying
to mogli what he wants mogli to do
and so they think right
we've got to rescue mogli
so baloo dresses up doesn't he
to make himself look like a lady
can you see
and the king rushes over
and dances with him
because he thinks it's a girl ape
he doesn't know it's baloo in disguise
and they're dancing and bhagira's trying to rescue mogli
but they're all dancing aren't they
so they can't get to him
and then what happens
it fell off didn't it
baloo's costume fell right off
and then king louis sees that it's not
a lady monkey
but it's just baloo the in disguise
so he gets really angry
and then they all run and grab hold of mogli
and baloo's got one arm
and king louis's got the other arm
and they're fighting over him aren't they
they're trying to pull him
king louis's trying to pull him that way
and baloo's trying to pull him that way
he is a nice bear
he's trying to rescue him
because that monkey wants to keep him
and he can't keep him can he
because he needs to go back to the village
with other people
no
the monkey doesn't
mogli does
but that monkey wants to keep mogli
because he wants him to teach him how to be like people
no
just mogli has to go back to the village
and baloo's trying to take him back
to the village to be with people
that monkey wants to keep him for himself
he doesn't want to share
well he's not sca sad
he's just realized now that
that bhagira's got him so they all run off together
see
but then what happens
he runs off again doesn't he
because they say you must go back to the village
it's not safe
but he doesn't listen to them doesn't he
and he runs off again
and then what happens
here comes the tiger
and the tiger was listening
to what bhagira was saying
when he was saying we need to find the boy
and he's asking the elephant to help him look
for bu for mogli
and he hears that doesn't he
so he knows there's a little boy running around
and then what happens
the snake's got him again
and then what happens
the tiger pulls the snake's tail doesn't he
and he says
where is that little boy
have you seen that little boy
think and the snake does know where the little boy is doesn't he
but the snake wants to keep him for himself
so he says that he doesn't know where he is
well he's run away hasn't he
mogli ran away while the snake was talking to the tiger
but he's really sad now isn't he
and he's sitting on that rock
all sad
and look
these vultures are teasing him aren't they
because he's so sad they feel sorry for him
and they all make friends
and then the vultures realize that the tiger's coming
so they s so they say hurry run run
but he doesn't run away does he
he just sits there
and he says to the tiger why should i run away from you
i'm not scared of you
you don't scare me
and the tiger says i'll give you a chance
i'll count to ten
but mogli doesn't move
so the tiger gets cross
and he tries to jump on mogli
but the vultures come down and they snatch him up don't they
and they fly away with him to keep him safe
and baloo comes along and he grabs the tiger by the tail doesn't he
he is trying to save him
he's trying to pull the tiger away
so the tiger can't get mogli
that's how he's helping
baloo's grabbing hold of the tiger
so the tiger can't get him
because he wants to make sure that
mogli's safe
he's worried about mogli
he's worried about the little boy
and then what happens
that's his mouth
and then what happens
the lightning hits the trees doesn't it
and they burst into flames
and the vultures say that fire's
the only thing that frightens shere khan
shere khan's the tiger
so he grabs hold of one of the branches
that's on fire
and they run back to where the tiger is
and they tie it to his tail
the tiger turns round
and he sees that there's
fire on his tail and he
thinks that he's on fire
so he runs off into the jungle
oh but mogli is sad now isn't he
because what's happened to baloo
he fell and he's lying down
do you think he's hurt
ah poor baloo
poor baloo
he's lying very still
and mogli says please get up
but he doesn't get up does he
and it's starting to rain now
and then bhagira arrives
and he says oh sam what's the matter with baloo
and then suddenly baloo gets up
and he says did someone mention my name
and he's alright now isn't he
and he gives him a big hug
and then the three friends set off to the jungle
because bhagira knows that there's a village near by
because they can hear someone singing
yeah they can hear someone singing can't they
and who's singing
a little girl
and he says what's that
and he goes in to have a look
i've never seen one before
because he's lived in the jungle all his life
so he's never seen other people before
where's baloo
there he is
oh there he is
they're going off into the jungle together
because they're happy now
because they know that he'll be safe
in the village with other people
yeah he's balancing something on his head
because he's showing off because there's a little girl there
and that's it
yeah those are the baddies

yeah
yeah he's naughty isn't he
because he wants to eat mogli

one spring day
a green caterpillar sat on a leaf
he's sitting on the leaf isn't he
hope he's not sitting on the leaf of my sweetpeas
he watched a beautiful butterfly
flutter past him on the breeze
look
look at that butterfly
it's pretty isn't it
your nose is running
tissue's just there
it's not fair
here i am stuck on this boring leaf
with nothing to do
and nowhere to go
do you want to sit on my lap
come here
that naughty nose isn't it
there all done
right
all done now
right
here i am stuck on this boring leaf
with nothing to do
and nowhere to go
while that lucky creature can fly across the world
and see far off lands
thought the caterpillar crossly
and what's more he continued to himself
not only has that butterfly got wings
with which to fly
it is beautiful too
oh he is beautiful isn't he
what color is he fraser
red
and yellow
and blue
yeah he's really pretty isn't he
look at poor me
i'm just a dull green
no one will notice me
and purple
no one will notice me
because i'm the same color as the leaf
the caterpillar really did feel very sorry for himself
and rather jealous
go and enjoy yourself
don't worry about me
he called spitefully to the butterfly
but the butterfly hadn't hear a single word
that the caterpillar had been muttering
and soon he flew away
the caterpillar suddenly decided that he was
going to be like the butterfly
the caterpillar wants to be like the butterfly doesn't he
i'll learn how to fly
and i'll paint myself lovely colors
so that i look beautiful too he thought
he looked around for something
to paint himself with
but of course there was nothing at all on the leaf
and he tried to fly
he launched himself from his leaf
and tried to flap his tail
you don't flap your tail do you
but all he did was land on the leaf below
can you see
look
he's trying to fly
he's silly isn't he
along came a ladybird
ah ha thought the caterpillar
here's a beautiful creature who knows how to fly
can you see the ladybird
yeah and what's she got on her head
a hat
and look
she's got lipstick on
and she's got little white shoes
on every single one of her legs
i bet she has to buy a lot of shoes doesn't she
i'll ask her to teach me
so the caterpillar said
hello i've been admiring your beautiful wing case
could you tell me how i too
could be a could be beautiful
and can you teach me to fly
the ladybird looked at the caterpillar
be patient and wait a while
she said wisely
and soon enough you'll get what you want
and with that the ladybird went on her way
because you can't find paint on leaves can you
whatever can she mean
she's just too proud to teach me
the caterpillar thought jealously
that's a bumblebee
sometime later a bee
buzzed past and landed on a nearby leaf
ah ha thought the caterpillar
here's a beautiful creature who knows how to fly
i'll ask him to teach me
so the caterpillar said
hello
i've been admiring your beautiful striped back
could you tell me how i too could be beautiful
and how could you teach me to fly
the bee looked at the caterpillar
you'll find out soon enough young man
said the bee sternly
and with that he went on his way
whatever can he mean
he's just too haughty to teach me
the caterpillar thought jealously
now a while later along came a bird
can you see that bird
ah ha thought the caterpillar once more
here's a beautiful creature who knows how to fly
i'll ask him to teach me
so once again the caterpillar said
hello i've been admiring your beautiful feathers
could you tell me how i too could be beautiful
and can you teach me to fly
the bird looked at the caterpillar
and thought to himself slyly
that here was a very silly caterpillar
what's the matter
what's the matter
have you got something on your tongue
do you want a drink
what do you want
do you want a bart bart
yeah
oh do you want a cup of milk
want to be a big boy and have a cup
no
you want a bart bart
do you want some vimto
okay then
right
where are we
this is a very silly caterpillar
he is a silly caterpillar isn't he
because he can't fly can he
but he would make a tasty snack for his chicks
let's see if i can trick him he thought
i can't give you wings
and i can't make you beautiful
but i can show you the world
i expect you'd like to see the world
wouldn't you little caterpillar said the bird
oh yes said the caterpillar in great excitement
climb up on my back then
little caterpillar said the crafty bird
look
that caterpillar's climbed on his back hasn't he
can you see
and they're going to fly off somewhere do you think
ah look
there we are
look
the caterpillar did as he was told
and the bird flew off towards his nest
at first the caterpillar clung tightly to the bird's back
but soon he felt quite sleepy
and eventually he dozed off
and slipped from the bird's back
down he fell
through the air and landed on a leaf
but still he didn't wake up
soon he was wrapped in a soft brown papery cocoon
from which he would not wake up for a long while
meanwhile the bird reached his nest
look at the treat i've brought you he said to his chicks
they looked very puzzled
what treat dad one of them piped up
this nice juicy caterpillar
said the bird shaking his feathers on his back
climb down little caterpillar he said
but of course there was nothing there
now it was the father's turn to puzzle
while the chicks laughed at him
well i must have dropped him he said
i've never done that before he added
where are you going
what's up darling
okay
has got you
look
she's got a drink here a drink for you now
there you go
do you want that
yeah have some vimto then
be careful
it's a big cup isn't it
i've never done that before he added
he flew out of the nest and searched for the caterpillar
but he was nowhere to be seen
that's it
once he saw a strange brown papery parcel on a leaf
but in the end the bird returned to the nest
with his beak empty
look
can you see
that's the cocoon now
do you see that brown thing on the leaf
that's called a cocoon
a long while later the caterpillar woke up
i must get out of this stuffy wrapping
he thought as he pushed his way out
he stood on the leaf and yawned and stretched
as he stretched he noticed to his his amazement
two pairs of beautiful wings
spreading out of either side of his body
look
at those beautiful wings
that's his body there
that green bit is his body
now he's got two beautiful wings hasn't he
are they really mine he wondered
he tried lifting and turning them
and yes he could make them work
he looked at his reflection in a raindrop
and saw a lovely beautiful butterfly
staring back at him
so the ladybird and the bee were right he exclaimed
how foolish i was to be a jealous caterpillar
he declared to a passing ant
for now i am a beautiful butterfly after all

who have you made that for
is that for tea when he gets in
fraser come here
let me show you what's happening here
oh no
look
the bus is driving very fast
do you know why he's driving very fast
because
this is fraser's house
and fraser's in the house with his mummy
and then that's the road
and then the bus has gone and he's gone to the castle and gone there's a dragon in the castle
and he runs back
and he says fraser will you come and look at the dragon with me
and what does fraser say
you want to go and look
but can you drive a car
can you
can you
okay
you drive the car
are you ready
brum
and you get out the car
and you have a look
and you go
ah
ah
dragon
and so what do you do
do you run home
and
is that what happens
and then
and now
you what you've decided
is that you can't really get close to the dragon by going through the door
but if you go in a hot air balloon and you land on it maybe you can go on from above and you'll be able to see him
you can land on the dragon's house
and you can spy in
you can have your own little like that
do you think that's a better idea
so go on then fraser
you go up
okay
i'll do it for you
okay
so fraser gets in the tr hot air balloon
and do you want me to come as well
okay
and i come in and we go
up up and away
and what do we fly through do you think
what's in the sky
or we go
watch out for the
fraser watch out for the clouds
should we go up or down
fraser should we go up or down
down
oh oh it's a bit shaky
oh
but what's happening
look
what's happened now
the cloud's moved hasn't it
so do we go up or down
we go over the cloud this time
oh
and you gotta say to me now landing

the night max wore his wolf suit and made mischief of one kind
oh he's being naughty max
and another
his mother called him wild thing
and max said i'll eat you up
so he was sent to bed without eating anything
that very night in max's room a forest grew
look at that
all those trees growing in his bedroom
and grew
and grew until his ceiling hung with vines
and the walls became the world all around
an ocean tumbled by with a private boat for max
and he sailed off through night and day
and in and out of weeks and almost over a year to where the wild things are
and when he came to the place where the wild things are they roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes
and showed
yes they're terrible monsters
and showed their terrible claws
till max said be still
yeah
and tamed them with a magic trick
of staring into all their yellow eyes without blinking once
and they were frightened and called him the most wild thing of all
yeah
and made him king of all wild things
look they've given him a crowns
they've given him a crown haven't they
and now cried max let the wild rompus start
oh look
what are they doing
they're making a big noise aren't they
they're all jumping about and dancing
oh look
they're hanging from the trees now
are they being silly
oh
and now what are they doing
are they doing piggy
they're giving max a piggy ride aren't they
now stop max said and sent the wild things off to bed without their supper
and max the king of all wild things was lonely and wanted to be where someone loved him best of all
then all around from far away across the world
i'm not finished reading it yet
he smelled good things to eat
so he gave up being king of where the wild things are
but the wild things cried oh please don't go we'll eat you up we love you so
and max said no
the wild things roared their terrible roars and gnashed their terrible teeth and rolled their terrible eyes and showed their terrible claws
but max stepped into his private boat and waved goodbye
and sailed back over a year and in and out of weeks and through a day and into the night of his very own room where he found his supper waiting for him
look there's his food on the table
and it was still hot
wow
did you enjoy that
did you like that one
mummy had this when she was a little girl
where the wild things are
do you not like him
is he scary
he's telling them to be quiet
or say be still
and they all stand still and they won't move
