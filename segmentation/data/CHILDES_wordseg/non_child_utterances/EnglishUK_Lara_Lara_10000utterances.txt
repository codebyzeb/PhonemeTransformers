this was uncle richard's uncle richard's book when he was a little boy
it says richard h
shall we read
ready
here are three little
piggies at home with their
mummy
you're getting big soon
you'll have to go and look for a new home
so she gives them some
and some
cake and she says see that the big bad wolf doesn't get you
so they go and look for a new home and the man they see a man
do you know what that is
it's straw
can you say straw
and one and one pig says please give me some straw
do you want me to read or not
right
one pig says
please give me some straw to make a new home
and he says
yes
he gives the little pig some straw
and there
that's the new home
he's made he's made a little house all out of straw
he says
the wolf can't get me in here
and then the two little pigs go on and they see a man with some sticks and one of the pigs says
please give me some sticks
i want to make a new home
yes donkey
that's right
that's who's got the sticks on his back
and then so the man gave the little pig some sticks
and the little pig makes a new house out of it
there's his house
and then the next little the last little pig sees a man with some bricks and says
please give me some bricks
i want to make a new home
and the man gave him some bricks
and there
he's made a house
you see
and then there's the big bad wolf
that's the sun
and he sees one of the pigs in the house of straw and he goes
little pig little pig
let me come in
no no
says the little pig
i can't let you in
so he huffs and he puffs and he blows the house down
and he eats up the little pig
yum yum yum yum
and he goes to the house of sticks and he huffs and he puffs and he blows the house down
and he eats up the little pig
and then he goes to the house of bricks
that's the house of bricks
and he huffs and he puffs and he blows
he says
i can huff i can puff i can blow the house down
but he can't
because the house of bricks is a good house
then he tries to get down the chimney
see
he's up there on the roof trying to get down the chimney
then the little pig makes some soup and it's hot and the wolf comes down splashes into the hot soup
and he dies
and the house of straw was not good
the house of sticks was not good
the house of bricks is a good house it says
i like it here
says the little pig
and that's the end

well
that's the three little pigs again
just a different book

but postman pat just gets out his sledge and zooms off down the slope
post and slope
when the winter ground is hard wild birds need seeds so postman pat takes out a dish and gives them nuts and seeds
put the comma in the wrong place there
if the common is frozen hard pat finds it very nice to quickly get into his skates and glide onto the ice
george has made a snowman
so pat says
i suppose we'll use these buttons for his eyes and a carrot for his nose
there
right
when it gets to autumn and leaves begin to fall nearly all the trees have no leaves at all
in autumn when crops ripen we are grateful for them all

kneel among the flowers and watch the butterflies

orange is his favorite one but strawberry's also nice
no
we've read that one already
each saturday in summer he pat has a game of cricket
he puts on his cap
takes the bat
and prepares to guard his wicket
pat takes tom's model plane and starts to make it fly

pat planted some seeds and cares for them
then much to his surprise
he put them in the flower show and found he won first prize

we don't need the mobile on
we're going to have sleeping beauty
now
right
you ready
are we steady
once upon a time
oh alright
well
we'll come to that in a minute
once upon a time a king and queen wished and wished for a child
at last their wish came true
the princess was born and the king and queen were very happy
the queen decided to give a party
she asked everyone to come
she even asked the three good fairies
but there was one fairy that wasn't asked
she was a wicked fairy
no
i don't
you like
the three good fairies
yes
we don't like the wicked fairy do we
go boo hiss
and we go hooray for the three good fairies
hooray
when she heard about the party she her green eyes burned with anger
they will be sorry they did not ask me she told her big black bird
on the day of the party all the lords and ladies of the land came to the town
oh
don't you
they're nice people though
they're all bringing presents for the little princess
aren't they nice
they're nice people
the party had just begun and the three good fairies appeared
we have various little gifts for the little princess said the first good fairy
she waved her wand
where's the green fairy
she's there
see
her mouth
well
she's got her back to us
she's looking at the princess isn't she
can you see
pardon
on her front
well
let's find the little let's find the page where you can see her mouth
er
that's the wicked fairy telling saying that when the princess is sixteen she'll prick her finger on the spindle and die
look
there's the green fairy's mouth
the third good fairy said i still have i still have my gift to give
yes
they are quite little aren't they those fairies
well no
they're just further away
the little the green one and the red one are just further away
okay
right
the king had an idea
if there are no spinning wheels in the castle the princess cannot prick her finger
so the king's men burned all the spinning wheels in the castle
they made a great fire in the yard
i think amy likes this book too
are you ready
but there was one spinning wheel that was not burnt
it stood in a little room at the top of the castle
look at the story amy
sixteen years went by and the princess grew up to be very beautiful but she was also curious
one day she came upon some stairs
i wonder where these stairs go she said
she climbed and climbed and the stairs went round and round
and so she opened the door and when she reached out to touch it she
pricked her finger on the spinning wheel
suddenly she felt very dizzy and she lay down on a little bed and went to sleep
when the princess went to sleep the good fairy came and put a sleeping spell on the castle
the king and queen were having dinner so everyone went to sleep right where they were
their dinner is getting cold isn't it
they're all asleep
even the horses and the dogs and the chickens fell asleep
nothing moved and nothing made a sound and only a prince could break the spell
look at the story amy
but the wicked fairy didn't give up
she told her big black bird
what are they
what
at those
what
the chickens and the dogs and the birds and the horses
or the good fairies
they're the good fairies
look
shall we find the prince
yes
no
let mummy read the story please
otherwise it goes on forever and you never end up going to bed
alright then
so here's the wicked fairy making the castle a forest of roses around the castle
the castle slept for a hundred years
yes
yes
but lara we never end up finishing if you hold the book so i'm going to hold it
then after all those years
a rode by
well
where's the prince
no lara
because then you end up going backwards and forwards and we never finish
where's the prince
you point to him
there
and where's the prince's horsie
that's it
he saw three women
the good fairies
what's inside this forest he asked them
no one knows said the three women
no one has ever tried to go in
then i will try said the prince
take this sword said one woman
huh
it's a magic sword
right
well
we can both see like that can't you
before the prince could speak poof the three women were gone
the prince cut off one branch with the sword and suddenly the branches moved out of his way so he rode into the rose forest
he didn't see that a big black bird was watching him
the bird went off to tell the wicked fairy
when she heard about the prince she flew into a rage
i must kill him
i shall turn myself into a dragon and wait for him in the rose forest
when the prince saw the tail from the dragon he held up his sword
the dragon blew blew hot flames at him but the prince was very brave and he charged the dragon
and what happens
it died
the magic sword flashed with light
the dragon screamed and fell to the ground
there
yes
it was a nasty dragon
it was the wicked fairy
the wicked fairy's changed into a dragon hasn't she
have a look amy
there's the horrid dragon
so the prince rode on
and he saw the old castle
when he went inside he saw a strange sight
no one was moving or making a sound
you can't you can now
no
she didn't
she was just doing this by accident
well
she'll do it again if you put your head there
the prince looked around and saw some stairs
he decided to climb them
oy
he went to the top of the castle and opened the door
when he opened the door he found the sleeping princess
she was so beautiful he bent down and kissed her
suddenly the princess woke
you're missing the point of the story lara
look
suddenly the princess woke up
the spell was broken
when they went downstairs everyone was waking up
but
amy
you have saved us said the king
have have anything you wish
my only wish is to marry the princess said the prince and he did
and the prince and the princess lived happily ever after
and that's it
all done
no

she's mummy rabbit and she says now don't get into mischief
shall we read the story on the back
shall we
we'll have to move the jigsaw now so we can turn it over
think they'll all going to come apart now
shall we take them apart
well
we can't read the story otherwise
and the rest
right
ready
once upon a time there were four rabbits and their names were flopsy mopsy cottontail and peter
they lived with their mother in a sandbank underneath the root of a very big fir tree
now my dears said mrs rabbit one morning
you may go into the field or down the lane but don't go into mr mcgregor's garden
run along now and don't get into mischief for i am going out
then old mrs rabbit took her basket and her umbrella and went through the woods to the bakers
now then
a loaf of brown bread and let me see five current buns she said
flopsy mopsy and cottontail who were good little bunnies went down the lane to gather blackberries
but peter who was very naughty went straight away to mr mcgregors garden and squeezed under the gate
first he ate some lettuces and some french beans and then he ate some radishes
pardon
there he is
look
eating lettuces and french beans and radishes
and then feeling rather sick
bluggh
he's feeling poorly
he went to look for some parsley
yes
he's eaten too much
he's a big greedy bunny
he went to look for some parsley
but who do you think he should meet round the edge of the cucumber frame
oh help gasped peter
it's mr mcgregor
mr mcgregor was after him in no time
look
shouting stop the thief
stop the thief
peter lost his shoes and ran faster on all fours
he might have got away if he hadn't been caught in the gooseberry net
hurry peter
hurry
urged some friendly sparrows
mr mcgregor's coming
quick
you must keep trying
that's
er
sparrow
a friendly sparrow
he's isn't he's telling peter to hurry up so that he doesn't get caught so that he doesn't get caught by mr mcgregor
do you want to read again
hurry peter
hurry
peter wriggled out just in time
you what
you what
take your thumb out and talk properly
well
we are reading it
peter wriggled out just in time
he rushed into the tool and jumped into a watering can
mr mcgregor began to look under flowerpots for peter muttering come on out you wee beastie
i know you're in there somewhere
then peter sneezed
atissue
yes
he is
he was naughty
and he went into mr mcgregor's garden when he was told not to
he was naughty wasn't he
peter sneezed and mr mcgregor was after him again
peter who was quite lost saw a little old mouse carrying peas to her family
if you please mam could you tell me the way to the gate
was all she could mumble
presently peter came to a pond where a white cat was sitting
he thought it best to go away without speaking to her
his friend benjamin had warned him about cats
what're you doing
oh
right
but then peter saw the gate
he ran as fast as he could past mr mcgregor
slipped under the gate and was safely in the wood
he ran all the way home
where have you been asked peter rabbit's mother
and where are your clothes
that's the second little jacket and pair of shoes you've lost in a fortnight
then mrs rabbit put him to bed and gave him a dose of chamomile tea
but flopsy mopsy and cottontail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper

and the taxi takes them to their hotel
celeste and the children all go inside and baba talks to the man and he says you be careful with my bag

baba is sad but he says okay then
the boat's ready to go
captain wait for us said the children

so they go for a lovely little ride along the river
and as they go to the bridge zefir the monkey shouts look look up there
there's the moustache man and he's up there with your bag
the children all shout captain stop the boat
let us off the boat
the boat doesn't stop so arthur dives off
splash
he jumps in the water
i'll catch him he cries

and arthur climbs out of the water and as fast as he can he runs and he runs up the steps and he's all soaking wet and he sees the man with the bag and he says hey man with the bag
and the man doesn't hear anything
and he walks away
and he runs arthur runs after him
he says come back mister come back mister you've got baba's crown
but the man got on a bus and the bus went down the street
and the moustache man was gone
oh no
are they ever gonna going to get that red bag back do you think
he is
but he's gonna going to go back and see baba and the rest of the family isn't he
arthur's standing in the sun to dry his clothes and then suddenly all the family come back and they say he says
oh
i'm lovely to see you but i'm afraid the red bag got away with the moustache man
there's another red bag says alexander
he points to a man sitting on a chair
the man's giving crumbs to the birds

papa that bag looks just like yours
yes it may be my red bag

but we must be sure it's the man with the moustache
they watched the man a long time
i'm sure it's the moustache man says zefir

the baba family circles around him and baba says
er
i don't think we're gonna going to have time for both of them
this is a really long one
look how much is left to go

the man looks up
he's not the moustache man at all
oh
excuse us says baba
we thought you were the man with the moustache
now it's dinnertime
time for lunch
baba takes them all to a restaurant
but baba doesn't have anything to eat
look
his plate's empty
because he's all worried about his little red bag
and his crown
he needs it tonight
he must wear it to go to the opera
but how can he
no
he's he's doesn't feel hungry because he's so worried about his crown
he thinks it might be lost forever
why what
why he wants his crown
because he needs it to wear the to wear to the opera
he's going out tonight with celeste so he needs to put his crown on because it's very important where he's going
shall we have a look
see if he finds it in time
then arthur jumps up from the table
there he is
yells arthur
there's the man and there's the red bag and i bet he's got your crown in there
the man was getting into a taxi
what color's the taxi
that's right
he has got a little red bag in his hand
quick shouts baba
we'll chase him
we'll catch him
the baba family got into two taxis
the blue one and the yellow one
and they both said follow the red one
the policeman whistles
they went zoom straight past him
but now oh no
they're stuck behind a red traffic light
they have to stop
they can't move and the red taxi is gone
poor baba
he's lost his crown again
oh
that's terrible isn't it
why what
why what sorry
why has he got any any any dinner
because he's so worried about his crown that he couldn't eat anything
oh
he was so worried
yes i i i washed it when i was in the bath didn't i
and i've combed it now
just got to wait for it to dry
yeah
right then
they get out in front of a market
i think we'll have to forget about the crown says baba
so the children begin to run around and play
they hide behind boxes and play hide
oh
we play hide don't we
then they see another man with a small red bag
there's the red bag
and all the children run after him and arthur knocks over some apples
and zefir knocks over a box of smelly fish
well
the elephants think that that might be baba's bag with the crown in
and the man's picked it up by mistake by accident
but now the whole baba family chases the man with the bag
down the stairs of the metro they all follow him shouting stop please mister moustache
there's the moustache
can you see it
too late
they got stuck again and the man got on the train
bring back my crown shouts baba
but the man gets on the train and the train goes away
sadly they come up from the metro
baba says nothing
he is very very sad
and all the children are very tired
celeste says i'll put the children to bed in the hotel
and then we'll leave them and go to the opera
back in the hotel room they said night night to all the children
the three little ones were already half asleep
he's not asleep but these two are
and he's nearly asleep
look
zefir's in his pajamas
celeste puts on a lovely dress and she and she tells baba to wear her crown
thank you says baba but it's too small
i'm going to go to the opera without a crown on at all
ah
poor old baba
he's gotta got to go out without a crown
and he's a king
why what
why without his crown
because the man with the moustache has got has got it in the bag
you know the red bag
the man picked it up on the and it's got baba's crown on it
they go to the big opera house
look
there's the big opera house
and it's all beautiful
and they see lots and lots and lots of people going inside
oh dear
says baba
all the people will see me
me the king without a crown
i just can't go in there
then
bang
a man bumps into baba
a man with a bag
the moustache man
hooray
and they open their bags and baba says i can wear a crown but i can't wear a flute
the moustache man smiles and says
i can play a flute but i can't play a crown
so
the moustache man gives baba the crown
and baba gives the man his the flute
and look
baba went to the opera
really enjoyed himself and he got to wear his crown
can you see him with his crown on
there
look
there's baba
there's baba's crown and there's celeste
and that's celeste's crown
they're the king and the queen
that's baba's crown
the story's nearly finished

once upon a time there was a little girl who lived with her mother
they were so poor that they had nothing to eat
the little girl went up into the roof she was so hungry she began to cry
an old woman came up
why're you crying
i'm so hungry said the little girl
then you shall be hungry no more said the old woman
she gave the little girl a small cooking pot
then the old woman said when you're hungry just say to the pot cook little pot cook
it will cook some very good porridge for you
then little girl when you want the pot to stop cooking you must say stop little pot stop
the little girl was so hungry so she said to the little pot cook little pot cook
little pot did as it was told and began to cook some porridge
when the porridge was cooked she said stop little pot stop
the porridge tasted very good and the little girl ate every little bit of it
then she ran home with the little pot to her mother
now our worries are over said the mother happily
the little pot will keep us well fed
whenever they were hungry they said cook little pot cook
one day the little girl went out for walk
when she was out her mother got hungry and said cook little pot cook
the pot began cooking porridge
the mother began to eat it
it was very good porridge
she enjoyed it
she was so busy eating she forgot to tell the pot to stop cooking
the pot went on and on cooking more and more porridge
then the porridge began to come over the top
but the mother and the mother knew she must tell the pot to stop but she had forgotten the words
the porridge just went on and on and on and on and on
soon her house was full of porridge
and still the little pot went on cooking more and more porridge
soon the house next door was full of porridge and still the little pot went on
soon all the houses on the street were full of porridge
nearly all the streets in the town were full of porridge and still the little pot went on cooking
all the people for their houses came into the street
no one knew how to stop the little pot from cooking more porridge
it just went on and on
the people in the town from the town began to think that soon all the world would be filled with porridge
are you
just as the porridge was reaching the last house in town the little girl came back
then she could tell what happened to the town
please stop the pot from cooking anymore porridge cried her mother
the little girl said stop little pot stop
and the little pot stopped cooking
anyone that wanted to go to that town now would have to wade their way through a lot of porridge
that's it
all done

midwife came in
only to collide with dad who was waiting for her near the door
i'm so sorry
she said
it's these skates
i always have trouble stopping
the midwife got straight to work
she fished her stethoscope out of her bag and listened to the sounds the baby was making inside the egg
oh yes
she said
this one's ready to come out alright
mum and dad
mum and dad looked on anxiously
meanwhile pingu got hold of the midwife's hat
look at me it's pingu the midwife
but nobody was interested
so he went right up to the table
hello it's pingu the midwife
can i help
dad looked at him crossly
took off the hat and pushed him away from the table
this is no time for fooling around pingu
we're all very busy
now keep away and just play quietly outside on your own
i don't want to
pingu shouted
why can't i watch
it's not fair
shh
whispered dad
the midwife had now got out her spoon and was tapping the egg very gently
the shell was starting to crack
two orange feet appeared and mum and dad cooed excitedly
pingu couldn't bear all this fuss
no one was interested in him anymore
they only cared about that stupid egg and every time he tried to have a look at it they pushed him away
it was all too much and he started to cry
but still no one took any notice
pingu tried once again to see what was going on
but this time mum and dad spread out their flippers so he couldn't catch so much as a glimpse of what was happening
instead all he could do was pace impatiently up and down beside behind them
this baby was certainly taking a long time to arrive
and then suddenly mum and dad
suddenly mum and dad smiled happily at one another and stood back proudly to let people see the new baby
i've got a sister
said pingu
hello
i'm your brother
the new baby gurgled with pleasure and began to suck one of her feet
i think the baby has a dirty bottom
pingu told the midwife importantly
you're right
said the midwife
perhaps you can help me clean her up
the midwife wiped the baby's bottom clean and gave the dirty cloth to pingu
will you throw this away for me
she said
pingu took the cloth and put them in the toilet and then he pulled the chain
looking after a baby is hard work
he thought to himself
it was time for the midwife to go
thank you for everything
said mum and dad
anytime
said the midwife
and she skated out of the door
mum and dad bent over to admire the new baby
you'll have to stop smoking that smelly old pipe now we have a baby in the house
said mum
i know who might like the pipe
said pingu
and he took it outside for the snowman
dad rocked the baby in his arms
i think we'll call you pinga
he said gazing adoringly at his new baby daughter
no lara
amy's playing with that
mum gave pinga
oh dear
oh dear
you are tearful
well
put it in that hand
you have that hand
she must be hungry after all that hard work hatching out of her shell
dad started to set up his camera
what we need is a nice family picture now our new baby's here
everyone lined up in front of the camera
pingu put on his best camera smile and tried to look as handsome as possible
flash went the camera and here's the photo dad's camera took
don't they look a happy family
and that's it
right children
i think we'll take the paper out of your mouth
oh my god

on the way back from elsie grandma
on the way back from elsie grandma

that would be lovely

that'd be very nice
thank you
we'll go in the new car
we'll go in the new car
and we'll go and see elsie grandma
and then we'll go to the pub
is that okay
do you want to come over here then and we'll read it
she's so tired
okay
pingu and the new baby
who bought you this
no it was emma and jim and abi and cesca
one morning pingu was sitting reading his
when he heard mum and dad talking in excited voices on the other end of the room
we've already read this twice
it's it's that egg again
thought pingu to himself
mum and dad always seem to be fussing over that egg
so he just carried on reading his book
mum and dad had been sitting on the egg
why were they sitting on the egg
because they are
yes
keep it warm
and to keep it warm as well
but today was something better
i'm sure i felt it move
dad told mum
do you think it's about to hatch
oh my goodness
said mum anxiously
lara
what sort of animal is pingu
pingu's a
told you
yes
brilliant
dad got up off the egg and had a look at it
where's the egg
is that it
it was beginning to bulge and roll around as if something inside it was determined to get out
pingu looked up from his comic again
this time he couldn't believe his eyes
he stared at the bulging egg and knew that at last his new baby brother or sister would soon be here
did you did your baby sister come out of an egg
where did your baby sister come from
then at the same moment the kettle began to whistle so they all stopped and had a cup of tea
the washing's out
yes
it's not gonna going to rain though is it
the sun's out
and we've got the sun open in the new car
oh
it's ever so exciting
we've got the sun open in the new car
it's ever so exciting you know
suddenly everything seemed to be happening all at once
pingu went to answer the phone but dad stopped him
leave it pingu fussed dad
we're far too busy to talk to anyone
but i can't stand all this noise
said pingu
and he started to cry
because he couldn't stand all the noise
it was too noisy for pingu
what do you say lara
sorry
mum stepped in
she took the kettle off the heat and picked up the phone
we're very busy today
please ring back tomorrow
and then she went to comfort pingu
it's alright pingu
she said
and just think in a little while you'll have a little baby to play with
and then she had an epidural
suddenly there was a loud yelp from dad who was sitting on the egg again
oh
ouch
he said
something orange had poked its way through the shell and prodded dad right in the bum
bottom
go and ring the midwife and tell her to come quickly
we'll need her help to get the baby out of the egg
mum shouted to dad
in an extremely worried voice
dad rang the midwife who said she'd come round straight away
don't spoil it
while mum got things ready pingu decided to go outside and wait for the midwife
midwife
hurry up
he said
our new baby's about to come
about to arrive
in no time at all the midwife came rushing along on her skates
pingu opened up the door for her and she went zooming in
only to collide with dad who was waiting for her near the door
i'm so sorry
she said
it's these skates
i always have trouble stopping
the midwife went straight to work
she fished her
do you know what that's called
what she's got round her ears
it's called a stethoscope
she got it out of her bag and she listened to the sounds the baby made inside the egg
lara
lara
lara
you haven't shown daddy what we made for amy
what have you made for
is that a mobile
wow
it goes all the way down so she can touch it doesn't it lara
when she's on the floor
does she like it
she does
yes
she tries to eat the fishes
so who made that
yes
brilliant
mummy did a bit more than lara who got fed up after coloring two fishes
well
that's not bad though is it
that's very good
and that's all for your sister
that's very kind of you
whee whee whee whee
it's a work
do you remember where we went to that party
i went to that work today
do you remember the lady who hasn't got any hair
i went to see her
because because that's my work today
and i'm and the man will pay me lots of money for going there today
we'll have to wait and see
well i'll tell you what
shall i use the money that i get paid for work today
shall i use that to spend at the pub
and we'll have
you can have some ice or something at the pub
yes
with the money daddy's earned from work
is that alright
have you shown daddy your socks
what socks are they
wow
the other socks are on the radiator in our room
oh right
so this is er
those are out of the washing
so if you want i t you hit the right foot and if you want b b you hit the left foot
shall i read the story
okay
have you
that's terrible that is
poorly
it's getting better though
meanwhile pingu had got hold of the midwife's hat
he put it on and shouted at everyone
look at me it's pingu the midwife
er
everybody ignored him they were gently gazing at this egg
so pingu went right up to the table where everyone was bending over the egg and tried again
hello it's pingu the midwife here
can i help
dad looked at him crossly and told him to take off the hat
and pushed him away from the table
this is no time for fooling around pingu
we're all very busy
now keep away and just play quietly outside on your own
poor old pingu hey
i don't want to
pingu shouted
why can't i watch as well
it's not fair
shh
whispered dad
the midwife had now got out her spoon and was taping the egg very gently
the shell was starting to crack
two orange feet stuck out
pingu couldn't bear all this fuss
no one seemed interested in him anymore
they only cared about that stupid egg and every time he tried to have a look at it they pushed him away or told him to be quiet
it was all too much for pingu and he started to cry
bit of a crybaby pingu isn't he
yes
pingu tried once again to see what was going on
but this time mum and dad spread out their flippers so he couldn't catch so much as a glimpse of what was happening
instead all he could do was walk up and down impatiently behind them
okay
you haven't got mummy
mummy's over here
daddy's over here with you
this baby was certainly taking a long time to get to arrive
and then suddenly mum and dad smiled happily at one another and stood back proudly to let pingu see the new baby
i've got a sister
said pingu
hello
i'm your brother
and the new baby went and began to suck one of her toes
feet
and the new baby gurgled with pleasure and began to suck one of her feet
i think the baby has a dirty bottom
pingu told the midwife importantly
you're right
said the midwife
perhaps you can help me clean her up
no way
said pingu and did a runner
oh no
no
pingu wiped the baby's bottom clean and then gave the dirty cloth to pingu
no
not pingu
the midwife
oh yes the midwife
would you like to throw this away for me
she said
pingu took the cloth threw it down the toilet and pulled the chain
looking after a baby is hard work
he thought to himself
it was time for the midwife to go
thanks for everything
said mum and dad
anytime
said the midwife and she skated out of the door
mum and dad bent over to admire the new baby
you'll have to stop smoking that smelly old pipe now we have a baby in the house
said mum
i know who might like the pipe
said pingu
and he took it outside for the snowman
dad rocked the baby in his arms
i think we'll call you pinga
he said gazing adoringly at the new baby daughter
mum gave pinga a nice bottle of milk
she must be hungry after all that hard work hatching out of the shell
dad started to set up his camera
what we need now is a nice family picture now that our new baby's here
yes

and they take all their clothes off
and they climb up on the wall
and they get rid of their clothes

and there they see the ducks and they're going into the river
and they stop to look at the kittens and they pick up the clothes and put them on
oh my goodness

and off they go
and they do look silly don't they
and then tabatha twitchit comes down and sees her kittens with no clothes on

the wind was blowing hard at the southpole so pingu and pinga decided to fly their kite
isn't it pretty
said pingu as the kite swooped gracefully
make it fly higher
said pinga
pingu ran backwards and let out some string so that the kite would fly up into the air
unfortunately just as a big gush of wind came along
he tripped over and fell
oh dear look
he's fallen
i wonder what's going to happen
oh no
cried pingu
the kite
the kite hovered for a second and then came crashing down and fell right on top of the igloo
what
i shall put it on a table

i'm gonna put it on the table
instead of on the couch
so that you can sit on it if you want to

asked pingu worriedly
perhaps if you pull the string it will slide down
suggested pinga
pingu pulled on the string but the kite still wouldn't come down
pull harder
said pinga
pingu pulled so hard that the string fell off
and the kite was still stuck on top of the igloo
look
it's stuck up on the top and they can't get it down
he pulled the string
he pulled the string hard
and all the happened was the string snapped off
look
the string snapped off but the kite's still up there
let's have a look what happens
pingu glared at pinga

pinga went inside to fetch help

mum can't help

pingu went over to dad

she asked
i'm busy ironing
said dad
you'll have to wait until i'm finished
oh daddy's busy as well
oh
pingu went outside to tell pinga
pinga went outside to tell pingu that they would have to wait for their kite
just as she came out of the door pingu threw a large snowball to try and knock the kite off the roof
it missed the kite and landed right on pinga's head
and knocked her over
oh dear
now he's knocked her over
there's the kite still up there look
oh hello

pingu rush came rushing over straight away

he said wiping the snow off his sister's head
i was trying to hit the kite
that's alright
said pinga
mum and dad are too busy to help us so you'd better try again
look at the snowball up there look
pingu gathered up enough snow to make a really big snowball
and threw it as hard as he could at the kite
the kite came slithering down off the roof and landed with a loud crunch on the ground
oh
they've managed at last look
the two little penguins ran over to see what had happened to their kite
it was lying in pieces in the snow
oh dear
said pingu

oops
hundred and
once there were ten dalmatian puppies
pongo was their father
start over here
higher
you forgot these two
nine
ten
you forgot them two didn't you
once there were ten dalmatian puppies
pongo was their father
perdy was their mother
they all lived in a house in the city with two very nice people
one day the puppies went for a walk
a woman named cruella was going by in her car
cruella was a dog thief
as soon as she saw the puppies she stopped to count them
ten
she cried
ten dalmatian puppies
i must have them
oh
she's naughty
she's going to steal the puppies
two men worked for cruella
their names were horris and jasper
horris was short fat and dumb
jasper was tall thin and dumb
i want those puppies
she told them
get them tonight
then that night japer and horris sneaked into the house where the dalmatians lived
everyone was asleep
they put the puppies in a big black bag then they climbed out the window
the puppies began to bark inside the bag
pongo and perdy were woke up
their basket was empty
the puppies were gone
where are the puppies
cried perdy
i don't know
said pongo
oh look look
the basket's empty now
the puppies are gone
them naughty men's pinched them
horris and jasper
then pongo had an idea
we'll send a message to all the dogs in the city
maybe someone has seen our puppies
so pongo sent a message
the message went from dog to dog
a yip a yelp
dalmatian puppies need your help
a bark a woof a long bow wow
find our puppies
find them now
soon all the dogs in the city were barking
look
all the dogs are barking
bet that's noisy isn't it
when all the dogs are barking
in an old barn near the city there lived a horse named captain
a dog named colonel
and a cat named seargent tibs
that night they heard barking
it was coming from the city
it's a message
said the colonel
someone is looking for dalmatian puppies
non here sir
said tibs
then i then they heard more barking
coming from the house down the road
sounds like puppies
said colonel
i believe you're right
said tibs
then we must go and see if they are dalmatian puppies
said the colonel
why do we have to do that
asked the captain
because of the message
said tibs
they marched down the road and up to the old house
the barking got louder and louder
how odd
said the colonel
there is a light in one window
why is that so odd
said the captain
because no one lives here
said tibs
they went to the window and peaked in
the room was full
filled with dalmatian puppies
look at that
look lara
look at all them puppies
hundreds of them isn't there
yes
they're all in there
a man was holding a big black bag
it was filled with ten more dalmatian puppies
a woman in a fur coat was saying
now i have ninety nine dalmatian puppies
tomorrow i will sell all of them to the circus and the three of us will get rich
the three animals raced back to the barn
then the colonel sent a message
calling all dogs
every mutt and hound
the dalmatian puppies have been found
a yip a yelp a short bow wow
come and save them
come right now
soon the city dogs were barking again
it will
try it again
let's have a look
give me a hold of it a minute
there so
you have it won't work if you keep it like that
you've gotta keep it down like that
right
turn the page over again
at last the message came to pongo and perdy
the puppies have been found
cried pongo
we must go and save them
and they jumped out of the window
pongo and perdy ran through the city
the city dogs met them along the way
they told pongo and perdy how to get to the old barn
oops
you've dropped your pen
when the colonel saw them coming
he called
are you looking for the dalmatian puppies
yes
they called back
are you gonna sit over here and finish the story
they then follow us said the colonel
they are in the old house down the road
so pongo and perdy followed the colonel and the captain and seargent tibs
pongo and perdy went into the old house
they saw two men with their puppies
the two men saw them
well look who's here
said jasper
two big ones
we'll take care of them won't we
pongo growled and leaped at jasper
he bit into jasper's jacket and pulled it over jasper's head
jasper could not see where he was going
next tibs leaped into the air
meaow screeched tibs
yes

pingu and the kite
that's your name
yes
the wind was blowing hard at the south pole so pingu and pinga decided to fly their kite
isn't it pretty
said pingu
make it fly higher
said pinga
pingu ran backwards and let out some string
unfortunately just as a big gush of wind came along he tripped up and fell over
oh no
the kite
the kite came crashing down and fell on top of the igloo
how am i gonna going to get the kite down
said pingu
perhaps if you pull the string it will slide down
said pinga
pingu pulled on the string but the kite wouldn't come down
pull harder
said pinga
pingu pulled so hard the string fell off
but the kite was still stuck on top of the igloo
pingu glared at pinga
now what am i going to do
we could go and ask mum and dad to help us
said pinga
you go and ask them
said pingu
mum mum
said pingu
the kite's stuck on top of the igloo and we can't reach it
can you get it down
i'm busy reading the newspaper
said mum
go and ask dad
mum can't help
dad can you get the kite off the roof for us please
i'm busy ironing
said dad
you'll have to wait until i'm finished
pinga went outside to tell pingu that they would have to wait for their kite
just as she came out of the door pingu threw a large snowball to try and knock the kite off the roof
it missed the kite and landed right on pinga's head and knocked her over
ouch
said pinga
it's cold
pingu came rushing over straight away
i'm sorry
i was trying to hit the kite
that's alright
said pinga
mum and dad are too busy to help us so you'd better try again
pingu gathered up enough snow to make a really big snowball
and threw it as hard as he could at the kite
the kite came slithering down off the roof and landed with a large crunch on the ground
the two little penguins ran over to see what had happened
it was lying in pieces in the snow
oh dear
said pingu
mum and dad will have to help us now
we can't possibly fix it on our own
pingu went inside to tell mum and dad what had happened
mum please come and help
it's broken
no
said mum
i want to read the paper
wait until i've finished
pingu didn't want to wait so he asked dad
dad
come and help us fix the kite
you'll have to wait until i've finished this ironing
said dad
i've got a lot to do
thanks for nothing
said pingu rudely
and he stormed out
don't talk to your parents like that
said dad
but pingu had already slammed the door
they're too busy to help us
said pingu
what shall we do now
let's go and ask grandpa
said pinga
he's never too busy
what a good idea
said pingu

while hopper and squeeker went on their way
that evening wolf came along the road and called out to grunter through the window
let me in
i love fat little pigs
but grunter kept the door shut
i shall blow and blow i blow that house the house down
cried the wolf
and with three great bigs puffs he blew the house of straw to pieces
look
all to pieces
grunter escaped by running across the field and hiding under the hedge
do you want to look at them pictures before we turn over
that nasty wolf's blown the house down hasn't he
when porker and squeeker left grunty grunter they saw a boy gathering sticks
i should like to buy your bundle of sticks to build a house

said the boy
so porker took the sticks and built himself a stick house
well
look at it

not very nice is it
shall we see what happens
when the wolf came though the wood he saw porker at the window
open the door
he cried
oh no
answered porker
i don't like wolves
then i'll blow and i'll blow and i'll blow the house down
cried the wolf
he blew seven great puffs and the house of sticks fell to pieces
that's not very good is it
let's have a look
porker managed to scuttle out of the back door and hide behind a tree
squeeker walked along the road by himself
while porker was building his house of bricks and there by the side of the road he saw a man
it's alright darling
a man wheeling a load of bricks
squeeker was the youngest pig but he was the cleverest and he decided to build his house of bricks and a fine strong house it was
the wolf was feeling very hungry by now
two of the fat little pigs had escaped and he was still looking for his supper
let me in
he cried to squeekey
it's too late
answered squeekey
i am just going to bed
very well
replied the wolf
i shall blow and i'll blow i blow the house down
oh
see there's there's the brick house
it's a nice one isn't it
do you think do you think he's gonna going to blow that one down
i don't think he will
but although he blew and he blew the brick house was too strong to blow over
squeekey just laughed

the tale of mrs tiggywinkle
once upon a time there was a girl called lucy
who was always losing her pocket handkerchiefs
she said
have you seen them tammy kitte
the kitten went on washing her white paws so she asked a speckled hen
have you seen them
but the speckled hen went into a barn clucking
and then she asked cock robin sitting on a twig
cock robin looked sideways at lucy with his bright black eye and he flew over a stile
she climbed up the style and looked up the hill
yes lara
just listen to the story
then up the hillside she thought she saw something white spread on the grass
scrambled up the hill
up and up and up and up
then she came to a spring
and looked and saw a tin on the water
but it was so little the water was already running over
and where the sand was wet there were little foot marks of a very little person
lucy ran on and on
the path ended under a big rock
the grass was short and green
and there were clothes
but no pocket handkerchiefs
she knocked once twice and interrupted a song
a little frightened voice called
who's that
and what do you think was under the hill
a nice clean kitchen with a flag floor and wooden beams
just like any other farm kitchen
but it was tiny
there was a nice hot
at the table with an iron in her hand stood a very short stout person
her pink gown was tucked up
she was wearing a large apron over her striped petticoat
her little black nose went
and her eyes went twinkle twinkle and underneath her cap where lucy had had yellow curls she had prickles
who are you
said lucy
have you seen my pocket hankins
i'm mrs tiggywinkle
i'm an excellent clear starcher
and she put something
what's that
that's a scarlet waistcoat belonging to cock robin
this isn't my pinny pinafore
said lucy
that's a damp tablecloth that they used at
and this
her eyes went twinkle twinkle as she fetched another hot iron from her fire
there's one of my pocket hankins and there's my pinny pinafore
oh this is lovely
said lucy
that's a pair of stockings for
and there's another
but it isn't mine
it's red
that one belongs to old mrs robin
and it did so smell of onions
i've had to wash it separately and i can't get the smell out
what are those funny little white things
said lucy
that's a pair of mittens belonging to tabby kitten
i only have to iron them
she washes them herself
and what are you dipping into the basin of starch
that's a little dicky shirt front belonging to tom titmouse
now i've finished my ironing i'm going to air some clothes
what are those dear little fluffy things
those are the wooly coats belonging to the little lambs
will their jackets take off
oh yes
and look at the sheep mark on the shoulder
they're always marked at washing
and she hung up all sorts and sizes of clothes
small small brown coats of mice
one velvety black moleskin waistcoat
and a very much shrunk blue jacket belonging to peter rabbit
then she made a cup of tea
she was very brown and in the soap
and there were hair sticking the wrong end out so that lucy didn't like to sit too near
when they finished tea they tied up the clothes in bundles
lucy's pocket handkerchiefs were folded up inside her clean pinny pinafore and fastened with a silver safety
no amy
you play with that though it can't do you any damage
then they made up the fire with turf
and came out and locked the door
they hid the key under the door sill
amy
get off
and away they trotted and little animals came out of the fern to meet them
out of the ferns to meet them and they and the first to come out were peter rabbit and benjamin bunny
and she gave them their nice clean clothes
and all the little animals and birds very much obliged
as they came to the bottom of the hill there was nothing left to carry except lucy's one little bundle
lucy scrambled up the stile and said good night
and mrs tiggywinkle hadn't waited for thanks or the washing bill
she was running up the hill
and where was her white frilled cap and her shawl and her gown and her petticoat and how small she'd grown
and how brown and covered with prickles
why mrs tiggywinkle was nothing but a hedgehog
and that's it
no
i tell you what
we'll go to bed and we'll read monday runday
okay
okay
come on then

amy's asleep
fall over
oh right
what's the matter
oh dear
yes
i brought one down i think somewhere
where is it
oh
it's here
do you want the tale of tom kitten
right
once upon a time there were three little kittens called mittens tom kitten and moppit
they had dear little fur coats of their own
they tumbled about the doorstep and played in the dust
but one day their mother mrs tabitha expected friends for tea
so she fetched the kittens indoors to wash and dress them before the fine company arrived
first she scrubbed their faces
this one's moppet
then she brushed their fur
this one's mittens
then she combed their tails and whiskers
this is tom kitten
tom was very naughty and he scratched
tom
he was naughty
mrs tabitha dressed moppet and mittens in clean pinafores and tuckers and then she took all sorts of uncomfortable clothes out of the chest of draws in order to dress up her son thomas
tom kitten was very fat and he'd grown
several buttons burst off
his mother sewed them on again
when the three kittens were ready mrs tabitha unwisely turned them out into the garden to be out of the way while she made hot buttered toast
now keep your frocks clean children
you must walk on your hind legs
keep away from the dirty ash pit and from sally henny and the pigsty and the puddle ducks
i think amy's woken up
shall i get her
okay
hello
shall we go and read tom kitten to all our babies
this is my baby
shall we read a story to them
your baby's what
sicko
satto
right
right
here we are then
moppet and mittens walked down the garden path unsteadily
presently they trod upon their pinafores and fell on their noses
when they stood up there were several green smears
let's climb climb up on the rockery and sit on the garden wall
said moppet
they turned their pinafores back to front and went up with a skip and a jump
moppet's white tucker fell down into the road
tom kitten was quite unable to jump when walking upon his hind legs and trousers
he came up the rockery by degrees
breaking the ferns and shedding buttons right and left
he was all in pieces when he reached the bottom of the wall
moppet and mittens tried to pull him together
his hat fell off and the rest of his buttons burst
oh
while they were in difficulties there was a pit pat paddle pat
don't be silly lara
and three puddle ducks came along the har high road marching one behind the other and doing the goosestep
pit pat paddle pat
pit pat paddle pat
they're geese aren't they
yes
they are
yes
they are
yes
they are
they're
oh alright then
they're puddle ducks
you're right
they're ducks
they're ducks
they stopped and stood in a row and stared up at the kittens
they had very small eyes and looked surprised
and the two duck birds rebecca and jemina puddle duck picked up the hat and tucker and put them on
mittens laughed so much that she fell off the wall
moppet and tom descended after her
the pinafores and all the rest of tom's clothes came off on the way down
come mr drake puddle duck
said moppet
come and help us to dress him
come and button up tom
mr drake puddle duck advanced in a slow sideways manner and picked up the various articles
but he put them on himself
they fitted him even worse than tom kitten
it's a very fine morning
said mr drake puddle duck
and he and jemina and rebecca puddle duck set off at the road keeping step
pit pat paddle pat
pit pat waddle pat
then tabitha twitchet came down the garden and found her kittens on the wall with no clothes on
bet she was cross
she pulled them off the wall
smacked them
and took them off to the house
my friends will arrive in a minute and you are not fit to be seen
i am affronted
said mrs tabitha
she sent them upstairs and i'm sorry to say she told her friends they were in bed with the measles
which was not true
quite the contrary
they were not in bed
not in the least
somehow there were very extraordinary noises overhead which disturbed the dignity and the pose of the tea party
and i think that someday i shall have to make another larger book to tell you more about tom kitten
as for the puddle ducks they went onto a pond
the clothes all came off because there were no buttons
and mr drake puddle duck and jemima and rebecca have been looking for them ever since
and that's the end
can i read it again

do you think she should be sitting on his shoulder
or do you think she should be walking down the road
yes
yes well
this is a road sort of here
right
okay
and these are fans
i think she should be holding one of those in her hand
what a lot of stickers all on top of one another
i don't think we want them all on top of one another do we
give her a fan there
you put a fan you put a fan on that
i'm not sticking it on there
i'm just putting it there
what
she's she's a spanish lady

oh look

now
what's wrong with this farm do you think
it's an alien
what do you think is wrong with this farm
i think what's wrong is all the animals
are sitting together
instead of being in separate little farm bits aren't they
so
do you think we ought to
get the er megablocks
do you think we ought to make some fields out of those bricks
no
yes
okay
right
hello
no
right
there's a field
you put what you want in the field
what else is going to go in that field with the panda
penguin
i think the penguin needs a pond
i think the penguin really needs a pond
how can we make a pond
er
we could get one of those egg boxes and that could be a pond
right
that's it
now
what goes in a pond
penguin
is there another penguin
what about frogs
where do they live
do they
i think they live in ponds
here's the frog here

put it over there by your toybox
okey dokey

is it
is he going to go in the field as well
okay
okay
okay
er near us
a womble needs wimbledon common
which is near where more dadaw lives
and it's got trees on it
perhaps we should put him near a tree
i'd put it

there was once a queen
no
don't do that
are you gonna going to listen to the story or not
yes
right
there was once a queen who pricked her finger as she sat sewing one snowy day
she looked at the drop of blood which fell from her hand
she said
how i would like a little daughter with skin as pure as the snow
lips as red as blood and hair as black as a window frame
when a little girl was born that's just how she looked so she was called snow white
but before
pardon
that girl
yes
called snow white
but before long the queen died and the king married again
the new queen was very beautiful but very vain
and she would look in her magic mirror and ask
mirror mirror on the wall
who is the fairest of us all
she was very pleased when the magic mirror answered thou oh queen art the fairest of them all
what was that
neenaw
but as snow white grew up she became more and more beautiful and the queen felt very jealous and angry
one day she asked her mirror
mirror mirror on the wall
who is the fairest of us all
and was furious at the reply
snow white is the fairest of them all
that's the huntsman
she told the huntsman to take the little girl into the forest and kill her
the huntsman was a kind man and decided not to do as he was ordered
he took snow white into the forest and left her there
warning her not to go back to the palace
snow white was very frightened at first but the animals she met were friendly and she wandered happily in the forest until the evening
it was growing dusk when snow white came to a little cottage among the trees
perhaps someone will let me stay the night here
said snow white
it looked such a friendly little cottage
that she walked boldly up the path and tapped on the door
no one answered so snow white finding the door unlocked steeped inside
the cottage inside was just as pretty inside as outside
snow white found seven little chairs drawn up to the table
and seven little beds neatly arranged in a row
this cottage must belong to seven very small people
thought snow white
perhaps they will be kind to a little girl
she took a tiny piece of bread from each plate and a tiny piece of cheese
then she took a sip took a sip of milk from each mug
no
that's a rein that's a deer
that's not tilly
that's a rabbit
who
that's a bird
feeling weary after a day in the forest she curled up on one of the little beds and fell asleep
now the cottage belonged to seven dwarves who spent their days digging for gold and precious stones in the mountains nearby
every morning
nearby
every morning they went forth with their picks and their shovels and worked all day filling their sacks with gold and jewels
and every evening they lighted their lanterns and came back to their cottage in the forest
when they arrived that night they saw at once that somebody had been tasting their supper
they looked around and soon discovered snow white asleep in bed
how beautiful she is
whispered one
shall we wake her
asked another
their voices roused snow white and she sat up in bed looking in astonishment at the seven little dwarves
he's got his lamp
for snow white
when she told them her story they very kindly said that she could stay with them in the cottage for as long as she liked
