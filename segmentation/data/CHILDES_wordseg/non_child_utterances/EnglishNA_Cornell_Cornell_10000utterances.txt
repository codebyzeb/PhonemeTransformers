want me to set this over here
maybe in a few minutes you can have some more
okay the worst about this coming out
it doesn't hurt but the tape okay
the tape sometimes sometimes pulls you see the hair in around here
sometimes the tape pulls on it
okay and that's the only thing that hurts
you know how when you have a bandaid on and you take it off it sticks to you
and sometimes the bandaid hurts worse than the cut it's huh when it comes off
what just going to what
what's that
that's the bandaid okay
and so you hold still
yeah right where it is it's going to be a little bit of a cut
okay that's why we need the bandaid
okay and you can set it right back down
that's an awful little arm for it isn't it
that's the way you hold still
you okay
you want me to stop and rest for a minute
or you want me just to finish and get it over with
can we just finish
okay you can all done
it's not too many kids who wake up with a smile on their face
you know that don't you
you must be pretty special that's what i think
yeah
you want to start getting dressed
yeah
you sure
you sure you want to go home
okay
if you're sure
i'll put the rail down
have you your clothes
you get dressed sitting right here on the stretcher okay
you stay right up here and get dressed
and then you can go home in a few minutes okay
okay does that hurt
okay
does it hurt any more
terrific
okay now let's put this thing on
like i had to wear when i had jessica
they like you to wear their own 
i don't know why
they just do
you're a little scared
mamma is going to be with you
i'm a little scared when i go to the hospital too
and everybody tells you what they're going to do
and that makes it less scary right
no
no that arm band is just part of this
it's going to be a little bracelet
we'll take it off after we go home
you want to keep it on forever
hey how about taking your boots off
okay you don't want to get your nice hospital bed all dirty with your boots
and then how about taking your tummy bothering you
okay
you really didn't like that prick in your finger did you
oh my
just get ready
because doctor strom is going to say
where is paul parsons
i don't know
maybe when you grow up you'll be able to wear your own jammies in the hospital
maybe when you are all grown up you won't have to wear hospital jammies
when you come to the hospital maybe they'll change
things do change in the hospital
now this goes
this says rodeo
says rodeo
on the front
it's a little uh big
i don't know
i don't know what we are supposed to do with your clothes
do you
i suppose we can just leave them
oh i'll remember the number
i see a five on the
and we'll come back and get them after
so how do you feel
okay
no
that thing tickles under your arms
just in
you're going to go to sleep
and then you won't feel it tickle under your arms
leave your undershirt on
you hate that thing
very uncomfortable
you'd like to wear your own jammies wouldn't you
that would be better
i'd like it if you could wear your own jammies too
they probably would because all the ones in the hospital look like this
they're more like your night shirt
see they're not really like uh jammies
they're more like a night shirt kind of thing
boy's room
huh
yeah i think i that little boy downstairs i think is going to have his tubes fixed today
ears fixed
and doctor strom is going to fix it
aren't you getting cold
no
hi donna
are you going to tell donna what you're going to do today
want you to put your green night shirt
green night shirt
yeah
how come that gown
babies get them up
i'm patty
i'm just going to take your temperature and listen to your heart
okay
have you had anything to eat or drink this morning
no
not even any water
okay
you want to try it in your mouth
just goes underneath your tongue okay
it's important not to bite on it with your teeth because it is glass
you just have to close your lips over it
okay
we'll try it that way
okay just lift your tongue up
now close your lips
just that's a good boy
just has to stay there for about two minutes
alright
it's got to stay underneath your tongue
okay
open your mouth again
okay good boy
now just close it
now i'm going to listen to your heart okay
okay it was ninety eight point six
no problem with that alright
did you hear doctor strom had a flat tire
i'm glad we didn't
okay
you don't think so
what
that's true
can have lunch then whenever we go home can't we
if we go home early let's have an early lunch okay
okay
because we didn't have any breakfast
know what she said
she said after uh you get your tubes in you can have a drink
have you ever been in a hospital before
yeah for what
same thing
are you allergic to any medication
that's great
do you have any sisters
two
isn't that nice
any brothers
ah are you the middle
right in the middle huh
right in the middle
isn't that nice
right
that's nice huh
how old are they

just a couple of months
yeah
that's nice
that's great
do you take care of your baby sister good
do you have you eaten anything today
okay
do you have any questions you want to ask about
no
we have mask over
you're going to stay like that
right
remember that before

i'm going to listen too
can i take a blood pressure in your arm
okay
any loose teeth
no loose teeth
no loose teeth no
alright
we'll take you in a few minutes
very good
see you in a few minutes
yep
that's going be
that's another doctor who's going to help doctor strom
it's a very special bed
it has wheels on it and it'll fit right out the door
i don't think we're going to use it
no reason we can't walk right
we'll probably just walk right in there
i hear doctor strom but i'm not positive
oh my
it says rodeo
that's where cowboys race and bucking broncos and horses
that says rodeo too
the star says rodeo and the circle with the rope says rodeo
that looks i think that's a wild horse
and they throw a rope out
somehow you learned a lot things that mommy doesn't learn them right
i don't know where you could where you learned all these things from
you learned them on television
yup
yeah
wow
well at least at least they gave you
at least they gave you a shirt
that has nice patterns on it right
not just a plain white one
what honey
let me see
wrap it okay
oh what is that
and that's a saddle
you know what a saddle is
goes on the top of a horse's back
it's leather
like my leather purse
it goes on the back
you sit there
you put your feet in the stirrups
do you remember when we were in california
remember the horses
wasn't there horses
no where when we had the reunion
we stayed at a ranch
and there were horses
sure
i got one to bring home to show them
in my purse
i got two by accident
noise out there
oh a little baby out there
yeah
what did you smell in that room when we went in the laboratory downstairs
what did you smell down there
i think you're famous
put your name everywhere
right and you have paul books
daddy got us paul books
did she
poor doctor strom
flat tire
he's coming in to fix your ears and he's got a flat tire
we haven't had a flat tire in ages
and you have to put your car up
i wonder if he can fix it himself or get a tow truck to come fix it
how did your baseball game go
good
we should have washed your hands before we came here
don't you think
oh well
i think she's probably having her milk
oh
oh we've got to
wait
yeah
could be an artist like your sister
like melissa
i know
ummhm
umhum
want that blown up
want to go downstairs
what honey
what goose
no big ones
because jessica
yup
if you share it with her
with your little baby sister
we should have brought a safety pin
that's what i wore for a whole week
how old were you when you first got your ear fixed
it must have been three years old
and now you're four and a half right
yeah
what
oh no critters
no you're much too brave to cry for a silly blood test right
much too brave
which finger
which finger
you can't even tell anymore
maybe you have to be very very strong
maybe it has a lock on it
yes sneeze sneeze sneeze
what do you mean a half a dream
oh
isn't this a funny curtain
because you know what that looks like
there's a fan inside that's blowing
yeah they did
patty
somebody named patty
your librarian
is that the same one you had last year or is she a new one
the one last year got pregnant had a baby
before i did
and before emily did
oh there you know there is another snap here
look
it's on much better than before
sopo
what are you talking about sopo
there's no soap so why don't we wait and wash them when
well that's true
uhhum
uhhum
it looks like a very special kind of bulb
well you remember when you go in to have your tubes there's any big because i'm not allowed to go in that
with you
i can go everywhere except for in that room because doctor strom will be in there
you'll be sleeping
but whenever you're awake
i can be with you
wou you do remember if you wake up in there
if you wake up in there tell me if there's a big big light in the ceiling
no brighter
why why not
you got a cut in your neck
went to children's with you today right
i'm not sure if we can today
how many quarters make a dollar
you're absolutely right
and how many weeks does it take to get a dollar
and how many teeth gets you a dollar
how many teeth
a thousand
let me see your tongue
i'll bet they're waiting too
i bet daddy's taking jessie to the baby and going in the car
i bet at night it goes off when you're sleeping here all
no you better not
in a little while when doctor strom gets his flat tire fixed he's going to come in and listen to your heart and probably look at your ears like he always does right
he always wants to see your ears
not on saturdays he doesn't look in your ears
not on sundays
but on monday he does
think she's grown
what
why are you so sad sweetie
that's right
we'll have to buy you a new one
did we did we lose blankie too
did we lose your yellow blankie
i wonder if somebody another child found him
and took care of him
do you think so
huh
i don't know
it's pretty black up there
oh yeah
you mean we're right next to another building
i don't know why they put a window there though
how would you put a window
maybe i know why
this building was built first
and another building got built second
next to it
right
look
look
leap
i'm going out now
you're going to stay right here
you don't have any slippers
what do you see out there
interesting
oh my
you mean there's nothing but beds in here
this is just a big hotel full of beds huh
this is like grampa's hospital
no
why
yeah
good
that's true
it's true
kids around here huh
no kids in grampa's hospital except maybe you
is grampa's room nicer than this or not so nice
not so nice as this room
grampa's hospital is a brand new hospital
everything looks sort of fancy you know
pretty
this is kind of an old hospital
but it has nice doctors and nice nurses
huh
what are you scared of
what do you feel scared about
you just don't know
you just feel a little bit nervous in your tummy
well you know what
that's why i'm here
because i wouldn't want you to be sitting here feeling scared without me to be right here right
that would be sort of sad
that's why mommies get to come
to stay with their children
and for daddy to come
or both of us could come
why soon we'll all be done and we'll go home
and you won't feel scared any more
will you
i'm always scared when i go to the hospital too
when i went to have my babies i was a little scared even after
you know that
even after i had melissa baby and jessie baby and paul baby i was a little scared when i went to have that little baby
it was fine
it went just fine
no right down the street
just a couple of buildings down was my hospital
too loose
or we can cut it off when we go home
you know that we were here before
you were three and melissa was just five
she just turned five
they always do names backwards in here
can you read that
pretty clever
well i think you're pretty clever
it's the date
april oh that's your birthday
april
four means april
twelve mean twelve right
and that's your birthday
and you were born in nineteen
seventy
nineteen seventeen
no way
nineteen seventy five
if you were born in nineteen seventeen you know how old you'd be this year
fifty three
i have to stop saying four and one half
you know why
because you're almost five
not four and a half anymore
okay we'll say almost five
how about we say not quite five
right
you do
the tape recorder here
how come it's different
oh
is it an apartment building
you did
let me see

i think i hear doctor strom but i'm not positive
hey that's neat
oh i see a big stairway now
what is it
it's very nice

how many steps
how many steps do you have there
one two three four
five is really down on the first floor right
six
sits like a sits like a little bug
it reminds me of this
reminds me of the airplanes that fly
good stairs
it looks like keaton scribbled on it
i wonder how that works
that's a lot stairs
how many you got this time
when you turn it a little bit do you get more stairs or less stairs
when you do a little turn
more stairs with a little turn
do you think you could make one that had twenty
and make big ones or little ones
which ones
big stairs
yes i think it's ten
we're going to get you fixed up again
okay

well you can have it in a little while
see you can go right in there
let's pull the curtain
let's and give you a little privacy
hey look at this
this is where you have to make your wet because there's no bath in the hospital
we just have to put it like that right
terrific
you just have to put that on you
i wonder what they did with your nice rodeo nightgown
does it feel okay
alright we'll just leave you up there
we'll cover you up
when it wants to come it will come
good good that's terrific
do you want to get some drink to drink
what do you think you'd like
ginger ale or apple juice
ginger ale
okay
how are you doing
would you like something to drink now
what would you like
apple juice or ginger ale
ginger ale
just going to give you a little bit to start out with
couldn't go
put it right under here if you have to
boy you did well you know that
you'll be able to go home soon
yeah
you were thirsty
this is where you come after you get your tubes see
everybody wakes up here
how does it taste
good
yeah
hey you got a drink before i did
that's good
that's good
is that all gone
oh you drank that quickly
you drank that quickly
there's a star wars poster
is that r two
no kidding
from space
no kidding
that's a riot
that's a riot
you know what
i asked doctor strom if he needed if you could go swimming saturday
and he said yeah
and you know what else i asked him
if uh you needed to wear a bathing cap
he said all we have to get is a tennis band
it's like a head band
put that over your ears
put the ear plugs in right
and put the tennis just put the tennis band right around there
a sweat band
and that will hold them
and you don't have to wear a bathing cap if you don't want to
doesn't that sound good
so all we have to do is go to a store and find a tennis band
maria has a head band yeah
i'll have to write that on your medicine list
daddy's going to say what medicine
do you remember going to sleep
no he says he didn't go to sleep
you didn't go
you didn't giggle
no
okay
and you wanted your breakfast
do you remember that
you woke up and you said
where's my breakfast
and we said
you can't have breakfast this morning
because you have to have your tubes and your adenoids fixed first
you know what
we're right in the front of the hospital
and if i look out remember where i drove in and i took the i went the wrong way and i had to back up
remember that
that's where we are
where they're doing that building
where all of those places are that said no parking
pretty soon we'll walk right out the front door
they're all waiting i guess
we were lucky we were first right
it's a bed
and it has sides because sometimes the medicine makes you kind of jumpy and wiggly
and these beds are so little
it's not a crib though
it's just called a hospital bed
you feel pretty good
you still feel thirsty
what sweetheart
why don't you lie down
want a straw
oh my goodness those are that is a blood pressure machine
and this is called an i v
you don't need any of those things
that might be for oxygen
these are all the things that people might need
but you're doing so well you don't need anything at all
just terrific right
does that cool you off a bit
yeah
it might make him feel better
you're awfully brave you know
you didn't cry when you went off
said a little bit
like a few minutes
boy there was someone climbing around right outside this window here
you can get dressed and go home
but before you do that i'm going to listen to your heart
this young man has the same thing
he's not quite awake though
not as awake as you are
sounds pretty good
good
perfect
perfect
you can get dressed
you have to hold mommy's hand because you still may be a little bit sleepy
but mommy can get you dressed
and we'll have someone check you and then you can go
you did well
i think the only way to get that off is to snip it off
here's your blue card back paul
he did very well
yes that's more than enough
mommy
go outside now
go outside with it
what
i'm gonna go outside with it
whoops it's going a little all over
go outside
maybe we'll all go sit by the picnic table
why don't you do that okay
oh that sounds good
can i make you one debbie
will you join me
no thanks i just ate lunch
you're gonna make me feel bad here eating all by myself
oh no please enjoy it
that's right
will she be home soon
well she should be home about three fifteen or so
i forgot
the teacher keeps her one afternoon and works with her on her reading and i forgot about it
well that's fine
she's the one that actually did it the best so you might consider if it would work out with what you're studying the older kids worked out a little better
right yeah
i'm sure
they were willing to ignore it
mommy
button this
it certainly doesn't go with the salad i had for lunch
for me i'll take ice cream most of the time
will you show me the way back there
ahhah
it's small
it's nice though for someone who
i haven't had a yard in some years
oh you haven't
so this even looks good
oh yeah
put up the swing
mommy put up the swing
so how has your job hunt been coming
oh well i've actually
i think i'm pretty much worked out
oh good
i'll
i'm doing research during june and then i'll work in an office
mommy where's my tape recorder
where's my tape recorder
pardon me
what were you saying
june i have a research job up here and july august i'll go down home work in an office
now where was home
it was near new york wasn't it
that's right
in westchester
what do you think zachy
what did he say
would eat it
what does it taste like zachy
mommy know what
i said it tastes like vanilla
mommy know what
when i eat this it tastes like big big crumbs
bread crumbs
just about bread crumbs
bread crumbs
they're cookie crumbs
i think they got this idea from an ice cream shop in boston called steve's
have you ever heard of it
my sisters live in boston and they always talk about it and there's one car over by centralschool that has steve's ice cream shop in boston bumper sticker
this looks like an ice cream sundae
oh
and that's what they had is cookie sandwiches or something
they have like eight bins of different things
they have broken up candies and oreos and peanuts and then you can order anything to be mixed right into the ice cream
i love chocolate sundaes
i see
i see that at centerithaca there's a big
yeah
i really
i guess going away to boston i found out that i like purity just as well anything else at all
my sister always was talking about going to steve's place
there's a huge line
that's what she says
in fact this ice cream is sold some place in massachusetts
because i go frontwards
oh yeah
i thought they were just in ithaca
can i go backwards
yeah
well they are but somebody who sells fudge has switched and now they sell fudge and purity
at least they were a couple of years ago
they were selling this fresh fudge and then purity i thought was serving their ice cream up there
maybe not
see this is what happens whenever i put the thing out in the room
right
it sounds kind of garbled
we have a bigger speaker to tie in the recordings
yeah the four of the kids are all
yeah that's what usually happens
so it's up to you to figure out who's saying what
i don't know if it matters for what you want
yeah i think basically everybody
i guess crystal and fred their voices are pretty close but otherwise
are you just going to take the words that are used
well zach is the loudest

although sometimes p and downtown
early bird farms have lovely tomatoes but they're very expensive
they're field tomatoes
they're good
you get three tomatoes for a dollar
but the supermarkets and the watermelon is good
i didn't expect that it would be good until
i found the center i found that it has the nicest fruit
that's what people are saying
i haven't gone over there
i've heard that the lobster friday and saturday
lobster
fresh lobster
we get that once a year
expensive
they bring
they're very reasonable though like a dollar thirty a pound
but i've heard that they've got nice things
do you live downtown
no i live up on the hill but i just come down because we have nothing
really little
iga is
their produce is so bad
sometimes i go out to the p and in east hill and sometimes i try to get down here
what do you walk
usually
sometimes when the weather is bad
like bees and yellow
and sting

we have friends who are and i'm the only one who turns around down at the circle
cars don't
you have to you know i don't know if it's more trouble than it's worth
you have to avoid all these big wheels and trucks and junk down at the end
that's right
but it's nice for the kids
yeah it's so nice not having to worry about cars
there's very little traffic there so i allow them in the road since they don't have sidewalks to play with the big wheels
that's right
by belle sherman school
oh sure
little tiny road
got oh about ten families
you just don't go down there unless you're going to one of those houses
exactly
it sounds just like our road
i was really attached to it
it really is nice
i mean i like being there the only problem
i know yeah
the only complication on my road was once they got older and wanted to do things

okay
why
i i borrow books for myself
yeah
but the same books as borrowed for althea you can read and the same books you borrow althea can read
so they can dry proper
why should i have grease on my hands when i'm not even touching the grease

deedeedeedeedeedeedeedeedledeedeedee
what are you looking at
to see if the tape is okay
i want to look
i want to hear some music on the tape
in a minute
okay
would you give me a hamburger with muffin
upbedoopiedoopiedoopadeedoop
want a muffin
we have to be a little careful with that
that's alright
it's not a lot
here you go
of milk
i can hold it
ketchup
hi poop
nanope
hi this is matthew
yes
shurietape
it's my thing
this is mine
mommy this is mine right
no we're borrowing it honey
from who
from one of my friends at school
susie come eat
i'm making myself a little salad
too hot
might burn yourself
would you give me something to drink drink drink drinkie drinkie
where's your cup
i forgot
you forgot to set the table with your cup
yes
will you go get it please
it's all set
no i don't like these placemats
someone gave me the wrong kind of placemat
alright
which kind did you want
that kind
can we switch
yes
there
thank you
anyway i think that howard might have been kind of peeved but
about what
will you give me something to drink
you want juicey juice
no
cranberry juice
i don't know if we have any cranberry juice
do we have cranberry juice
where's my other my other big one
will you put some cranberry juice in my cup
sure
eric i'm going to turn this over
thank you
no
will you put a little more ketchup on my sandwich
okay
i think that for whatever reason howard wanted marty and it was really obvious that the students didn't
and he asked them if
that's right
okay
are you sure
yes
could i have the ketchup please
is this
what's
classified information
what's
alright
susie
what's alright
is there dirt
well i suppose it is but i don't think
what's in my
what's okay mama
what's the study
it's on
mommy
language development
tell me what's okay
it's okay to talk when the tape recorder is on
good
it's a study about language development and they study like how often you would use what words with matthew and how often he would use them
i don't think it's a very terribly
it's silly
i don't think it's a terribly well controlled study but
no neither are we
i just thought it would be interesting
and i really like this little gadget
what
i really like this little gadget
well you don't want that clipped on to just one person
you don't
not if all of us had to be picked up on the mike
i don't know
i mean i think you needed more instructions
well what brenda said was
that i should just have it somewhere nearby so
anyway i don't see how howard can ignore that kind of information
he asked them point who they would like better and they did not hesitate
i think he was annoyed because as i was walking out the door he said it's really hard for you to let go of this program isn't it
and there was no reason for him to say that
so david is going to interview them both on monday and then we'll decide
uhoh uhoh pook you spill your juice
matthew i'm so excited you're learning how to write
when did you learn how to write
i don't know
did you learn how at day care
do they teach you writing at day care
what
what
do they teach you writing at day care
unhunh
um
just learned how to do stop signs
at day care or at home
at day care
oh
there's a stop sign
make stop signs at day care
yes
is there one is there a stop sign at day care
it's on the door
ah
you got the
but matthew didn't write that one
no you didn't write that one did you honey
know what i think the cats did
ate the cheese they caught
i think so too
what do you think daddy
i'm afraid they did
arparpbeepbarppoop
anyway i'll just be glad when the whole business is settled
it's very nerve
should be settled by the middle of next week
but i wouldn't feel very good about having somebody that the students didn't feel all that comfortable with and didn't feel was approachable
how can howard ignore that
well they didn't say she wasn't approachable just not as approachable in contrast
doing this training session was really fun too
i really like doing small groups training
they seem to really like it too
and they were really picking up their reflections very quickly
people are somewhat tuned to that kind of stuff
they really do grasp that concept very quickly
i'm eating dinner okay
excuse me
is that fun to do honey
the toaster just popped
what is this
trapezoid
oh this is that tape
i'm amazed
i looked through all the boxes
what does it say
magic
so she's all moved out
um
she's all moved out
mostly
all packed up
did you move stuff to steve and suzanne's too
no
will you give me another hamburger and muffin
is there
yes
a muffin for matthew
yes i suppose there is
so what do you think of my spicy hamburgers
very good
what's in them
that chinese chili and garlic paste
that's all
good
just take about half a teaspoon per hamburger and mix it really well
isn't it nice
are you sweaty
i was very pleased with myself
it looks like you're sweaty
i am
how did you
the spices make me sweat
because they're so hot
they always do
whenever it is that i eat spicy food i get very sweaty
i know you do
i get that with everything
oh sweetie
what are we going to make for jens and nancy
i was hoping szechuan
i know but what
i don't know
we've only got one anyway that we really really liked and that's the the chicken
if we just try an experiment on a new one
nothing with bean curry
how about we give
wasn't bad
how about we
the next day
ssh
how about we give them those berries some berries like the last time
that's an idea
berries
the kind that we get from the park that has no swings or anything or climbers
yes
the park downtown
yes
maybe we'll do that
would you like to help
i called jens back and he wasn't home so i left a message on his tape recorder and said about three o'clock sunday bring a salad
sounds good
what about that pork and potatoes recipe
i liked that
wasn't bad
it's heavier than the chicken
so
i'm not sure they mix well
well we don't have to
it is novel
we don't have to make the chicken
yes it makes a lot too and i really liked it
i'll think about it
it's going to be hard for toby being stuck having students of suzanne's all the time
yes
although i suppose if either of them drive us into town hitch a ride then we could watch
but then she'll be in town all day without a
true
a house
this is true
how is she doing
she didn't seem quite as gloomy today
as bloomy
oh gloomy
oh that's good
she feeling better
some
i guess
spilled your corn
what weird weather
it was so nice today too
i know until i was almost done with work
a conversation to immortalize for posterity
think it will rain
might
i don't know
well it's supposed to be four hours on tape
matthew carried a bag of groceries from the store to the car
he did
then he carried the bag again from the car into the house and he put them away
he did
all by yourself
and i threw the bag away because i couldn't fold it
and tha
that's alright
just
that was very good
good for you sweetheart
but they forgot his back at chrissy's
uhoh
was there anything in it
um clothes
yeah well they were wet
he slept in them and they were wet
as i understand it he took off his shirt and cuddled with it all night when it got wet
you you cuddled your shirt
how come you wet the bed honey
i thought you weren't going to
that's why you didn't want me to send a diaper
what
that's why you said don't send a diaper because i'm not going to wet the bed
well i for i didn' i forgot that i was going to hold my pee in
aw did you forget
oh alright
good hamburgers
matthew made his hamburgers himself too i just gave him a big pile of meat and he made burgers out of it
he did
wow that's great
i told him he wanted to have spaghetti and i said we'd have burgers tonight so you could make lasagna for tomorrow
right
well i didn't i have ground turkey i unfroze
sausage
i didn't unfreeze the sausage
i should have i should
i could
well even i bought you i bought extra mozarella and ricotta because i wasn't sure how much you'd want to make and whether they'll make it big enough
yes i just thought that would be a nice thing to
oh definitely

you know what
those
what
broken up ones aren't very good anymore
those broken up what
lasagna springs

the doctor put his stethoscope on nicky's back to listen to him breathing
whooshwhoosh whooshwhoosh the air went in and out of nicky's lungs
then the doctor put his stethoscope on nicky's chest
thumpthump went nicky's heart

and nicky heard the doctor's heart go thumpthump thumpthump
why isn't he listening to the heart
he is listening to his heart
but why not his ba on his back
on his back

i need to hold it
fix it talk in it okay
okay

the next day

okay
the next day they were thinking about their trip
and they thought of something they would crept up into matthew's room and think of something
what do you do with this
that's just if you want to clip it on to something
like
come on finish your story
like a blanket
don't don't fuss with it honey just tell me your story
and and they crept into matthew's room and superman's room and then eric room and they went flying over the rivers and the oceans over the rivers and hills and mountains and trees until they got to the same forest
and they went down down down until they met the bears
and
teddy bears
yes
oh
some their their dad and mom
and they said where's your teddy bears
and they said they went for a picnic
they're still having the picnic
why don't why still
well they had it all day
well where are they
they're they're over there and still eating
so they went over where the the teddy bears were and they looked for them but they couldn't find they were at home sleeping so they went back to the dad and mom and said they're not where they used to be
so they put crept into matthew into the teddy bears' house and looked in their rooms but they weren't there
so they crept in daddy's room but they weren't there
they were they thought they were hiding so they went back along the forest more more and more and more and more until they met the smart teddy bears
and they said teddy bears where are these some more teddy bears and they said i don't know poop
and that's the end
oh what a good story
whoops
there's not much left
like that
well what are they going to do with it
what are they going to do with it
they're going to count how many words i say and how many words you say
and to see if there's any words that we say that are different from what other people say
and then that will help them understand how children learn how to talk
how did you learn how to talk
i don't know
do you remember learning how
no
do you remember not being able to talk
yes
what was it like
i don't know
how did i learn how to talk
did someone tell me

i think the way you learned how to talk is i would say words and you would listen and then you would remember them
like if i gave you your bottle i'd say bottle
and then i'd say say bottle and what would you do
say bottle
no you'd say bottle
first you'd say
no i'd say bottle
no you didn't know how to talk that much
first you'd said ba because you couldn't say bottle but you would just try and say the words around you
you'd say mama and dada and no
you'd go no no no no no no
i was like

this isn't coloring book
but you could still color it
did you know that you could color even when it's not a coloring book
how
you can just color in the pages that you drew
it doesn't need to be a coloring book
sure it does
you can color on anything
but but that's just a drawing picture one
you know
well look will you get me the crayons
will you get your own crayons
they're right over there

i think you put them back
no i didn't
well go check

will you please do it
no darling i think you can do it
i already asked a while ago to bring it in
who wants his back
me
right
did you color that
that's very nice
you did a nice job
they're not in that box they're not
i put them in my back
a whole mess
i need crayons
i didn't put them back in the box because the dump truck i'm going to go get my dump truck
okay darling
to clean them up
do you remember where you left your dump truck
do you
okay
and there's your dump truck
no it's the wrong
dump truck
dump truck
did you drive him up to your back
there's sticks in here
and rocks
there
lincoln logs there are plenty of those
oh boy you do have a big load in there
i didn't know you had all those things in your back
and lots to carry about
and crayons
and lots to take out
to get the crayons
i hope i remember where the crayons went
there they are very bottom here
the crayons
yes
yes
and i'm going to dump them out
okay
there's only a lot them now
that's not crayons
will you open my back back
sure
thank you
you're welcome
oh going to load the crayons into your truck
yes
and then what are you going to do with them
put them back in the box
oh that's a good way to do it
i like it better here
is that your favorite truck
yes
dump truck can only come back to you you know why
why sweetheart
because there's it's so bumpy and and it backs over there's no bumps
oh
it's a dump truck
because it comes
this is all these flat things to make the road
this is all these flat things to move him around
oh is it is that the road for the dump truck
here's here's the little road where they put these sliver things under the wheels
oh that's a good idea
sliver things under the wheels sliver
and the dump truck drives on them
and the wheels meet two of them three of them four because it's a long bumpy
is it a long bumpy road
and cross off cars and gates
we're just doing it in one big place
good
because the dump truck sometimes comes comes
oh that's a good way to make a road sweetheart
they cross it down
because bumpy
they cross it down because it's bumpy here
and they make big piles of six so no one can get crossed off
and everyone can't get past except the dump truck
dump truck dump truck
well that's good
what are you making
this is so the dump truck won't go across
is that for the dump truck
for the dump truck so it won't be broken anymore
well that looks good
that's because the dump truck can't come past here
so then they have to get this down right here
ah ho
this is down here so the dump truck can get past
oh that's good
who's driving
no one
i am
are you the driver
yes
are you pretending you're very small and you fit in that little seat
oh that sounds like fun
i'm all just like this
oh i see
like
i see sweetheart
bump bumpy
he's carrying them
oh
is he making a big road
he's going to drive it over and to the dump
which is over there to the crane
the crane is going the crane is the crane is going to put it
is the crane going to put it in the big box
he drives down with a big load
oh
and up again
makes a big noise
see why
see why it makes so much
how come sweetheart
why does it make so much
there really is a lot but the crane has to pile it up has to pile it up
oh i see
the crane piles it up
i put it back in the dump truck and the dump truck puts it in the crane when the crane comes back up
he's not going to play any more basketball then
no he can squeeze in response to a direct squeeze of the hand but he hasn't said a word yet
he's had head injuries and he was semiconscious but he is fully conscious now
they maintain that he can't breathe but that couldn't possibly be the case because he didn't have that all the time
the lung collapsed when they took him out of intensive surgery
then they they put him back in again
mommy i don't want to do that
oh we're just going to sit here during breakfast
we're going out to water the garden
stay here a little while
is this on at the moment
yes
i wish it were on while you were talking because that is exactly the sort of conversations we want to cover
this is on right now
yes
i just heard a lot from jenny that she feels a little guilty about rebecca's broken arm and she has no reason to feel guilty at all
i was the one who said last june after all
well she said rebecca said
i want one more jump
and i let her go ahead and do it
and well that's okay
well let is a different word than to encourage
that's true
well i encouraged her
when i was ten years old i had a cousin that i goaded into jumping and she broke her elbow right straight through
see i asked where larry was and yesterday he called
he says she swims and does everything
it may go and it may not
she does everything
it does not impede her use of the arm
oh i would expect that
we never realized it was that bad
we knew that if zelco didn't put it together again she would never use her arm fully
boy you are really talking a good story
you came home to carol
i didn't realize that it was
i knew she had it worse
well it wasn't the hyper extension you see the fiber hyper extending that actually tore a little of the bone
they had to pin the rest back
i understand she had to go back into a cast that she had taken it off on my account
good morning
good morning
we are all early risers and apparently jenny also because her sister is a bed so she never gets up until her sister gets up
did you come out here and react to your grandma
i asked how she slept and she said she slept well but dana takes up most of the bed
and dana is in the jenny is against the wall
do you know that in situations jenny likes small little spaces so this works very well
i may let her sleep on the is that one of the peaches that i bought
no that's one of mine
they are a little ripe you have to cut out some of the
your ankle is hurt
well here sit down and i'll take a look at it
i'll take a look at it
can i watch tv
not this morning
come on it's boring
tv is boring honey just right
okay i'm going to go watch it
no you can't watch
no you can't watch
can i have that
yeah
i'll get her a sweater
she's a little bit chilly
yes she needs something for the cold
mom i'm getting cold
well i'll get you a sweater here
there isn't anything good on
mommy made a mistake really jen
what time is it
ah no
no no no
it's only eight fifteen
this is candid camera not so candid now but
did you sleep well last night
did you hear me come in
well then you slept well
did you hear that you completely monopolized the bed
hey last year she did it
this year i did it
did you think to yourself she did it last year i'll do it this year
well i think that she was trying to get under the cover which was nearly off her
well her feet were out too
it was all up around her neck
yes it is around jeeky's neck
so i pulled it down
so there you are jeeky
you know what you did
but her feet were totally out from under the cover
you had all the covers
anytime the cover keeps being pulled away
you keep i think they had it around their necks
dana's bottom was beginning to show a little bit and jenny's feet were out
you call it cute dana
well not really honey it was just
jeeky when did you wake up
oh seven forty
that's about right because we heard her clock ring when she was in here talking
i wonder what had happened to elaine joyce since her husband died so suddenly
you know bobby van died very suddenly of a brain tumor
here she is on the cover of the preview section
she has a part in a new series
what do you want cheerios or rice krispies
whenever my stomach gets a little queasy i eat pretzels
evergreen
have you ever read evergreen
who is it by
melva plain
oh i had never heard of it
could you let me see this
i hate that girl
her name is dana plato
she is a terrible actress
she just makes a fool of herself on the show different strokes
so stupid
i mean i love different strokes but she makes it all queer
have you ever seen the show different strokes
doesn't she queer it all up
jeeky are you done with the funnies
oh what's next
oh she's going to show you it works dana
it works
the combination of your two things
i'm going in the water with that today too
that's mine
oh it is
did you get that for your birthday jenny
i got it this summer
dana the comics are right behind you
jenny's done
then i'm next
that's the highlight of my morning
i save it until last
i love those comics
they're light
do you remember last week's sunday smith dana
what
do you remember last week's sunday snuffy smith
they were getting to go on a campout and snuffy smith and the little guy
oh it was so funny
you know it's a bunch of hillbillies
and she was just crying
no stop your sniffing your mom
and they're getting in the mule
what's the mule's name anyway
and she says ralph you go along and i'll stay home for three days
and as soon they get out of sight she's rolling on the floor laughing saying three whole days to myself
i got such a bang out of three whole days by myself
they go slowly and then they start up like that
that's from grandmother kelly right
yours is too
yeah i know
you fill it backwards from the start
oh are we going to show them lego land
oh yeah she was talking about her space legos
let's go in the living room
i'll take my tea in there
i like to sit in there
it was jewish family and physically the old hollering kind
it drove me crazy
i was so tired by the time i finished i could hardly stand it
they would hassle each other you know the mother would
i never bother with authors
i could give you the name of a good book
did you get that one
it was an upper intellectual type
the theme looked like a good one and i picked it up and brought it home and it was awfully good
she had been an extremely successful author and she died at the age of seventy two
she had received several awards
she wrote an article at the beginning that she was the first woman who lived you could ever find
she walked out on her husband and wrote and her kids too
she was jewish too
but but she wrote with her grammar like they spoke in those days
she came over an immigrant from poland and she went to night school
so all that writing was just kind of put on
she went back to her childhood and you know poor grammar the way they actually spoke in those without an education
it was awfully good
i and i can't remember the name of it
i surely want to get it and read it
it was so good
it was a series of stories in one book
oh it was good and you would have liked it
i know you would have liked it
i don't like those either but that one i did
i didn't
it was serious when i picked it out
it was her whole life
see it went on so it fit together
i got to get away so i don't see it
she's not able to do all that work
i suspect that if he can't do it he would wind up physically much less well
that's a typical pattern when you can't do the stuff even a much lower level
well he's seventy two years old
but he has the capacity to sit down and sleep like that i do not have
that's right so presumably
but when you sleep over your coffee that's pretty bad
but presumably he does the same thing i do
when i'm working out in the yard sometimes i'll just stop although i know i can do it
i would pay a price
do you know where i got the idea from
well aren't you supposed to make things from these pictures
i know how to make it from looking at it
it's pretty easy
be careful
watch out for that
don't
give it back to me right now
i want it back
i don't care
don't
i'm not letting you do anything
i didn't ruin anything
it just fell out
but you let it fall
i told you not to let it fall
i didn't this fall
that guy just fell off
how is it any different jen
i didn't let it fall
did it break
but i didn't let it fall
i said the guy fell
it was loose
no it was not loose
i put it on tight
well it fell off
they're out there playing now aren't they
it's alright jen
you've got your knickers on come on
boy you know i got a mosquito bite on my face yesterday
come sit here dana
i'll fix your pony
feels good
find the brush
dad just goes like this
he gets it and then he throws it around the leg
well what does joe do
he goes like this
dad goes like real fast
well watch joe
i wonder who is winning
he sort of aims
doesn't joe look funny in blue jeans
he's cute
that was close
but look he did better than joe did
i bet they just have different styles don't they jenny
mom but he doesn't be careful about his aim
but there are no points alright unless you can win
that i don't know
i do not know the rules of this game
i'll play dana and i bet you nobody will get a ring
but i bet you nobody will
we found out that mask was too big
yes but you know what we've learned
we've learned how to pick one out
did you see kinny giving that lesson jen
was it to you dear or was it to dana
it was to dana
you stuck on the nose and see if it stays
that would have been the perfect place to have had a mask
wouldn't it have been jen
the water was so clear
which quarry did you like better
the second one
this one or the one last year
oh
i like them both the same but i really like the one last year because it was big
and no masses in the middle just one big place to swim around
and the other place had a shallow end too
and you could dive in the other one
i like this one because we were the only ones there
i know
and there were only two other people three other people all men besides us there last year
there were more than that
there was a boy sitting on the rocks and you borrowed their inner tube
remember that
that's the one i'm talking about
then there were the kids over up higher
there were those students up on top of the rocks
there were a bunch of students up on the rocks
but they weren't really there
they were diving
but they were there
you could feel that they were there
it wasn't
i like crowds you know ma
do you
but that wasn't a crowd
no it's true
it wasn't a crowd
jenny i have to find you another bottle
they're never going to score again
we play it you get one point for the closest person
but they're not scoring at all
no leaners no ringers no anything else
they'll be pitching all day
no they won't
not if they decided to do it my way
i don't have this high enough
i like penny
penny falls and i like her
penny is a sweet girl
how old is penny's mother
well she's twelve years old
you know woody has been awfully close mother
dad likes dogs
i can tell that
he always like to play
i want a dog like angie and like that black dog that larry has
did you like those spotted dogs that were out on the farmhouse
unhunh
they didn't chase at all
they didn't chase
i like magpie
i like cute dogs that run fast
i like magpie
i like those big dogs
angie's very well trained too
i can dress him
i can
do you know how to dress dan
yes jennifer
i don't know
how do you do it
you say dress angie dress and angie puts his nose through and then you kind of push it his collar
oh really
is angie in the white house that is across from us
are those same kids going to be back there next year
well actually some of them left
but the one who owns angie did not leave yet
why you don't like them
they are very noisy dana
they cooled down now
they're nice though
they may be nice but they're noisy
dana if she doesn't want it you can't do it
because she's letting it grow out now
besides when she's ten years i told her she could do as dana does
i want it down ma
do you want to keep bangs or not
yes
even though i do need a hair
you certainly do
shall we trim them today
they're almost in your eyes
if you want your hair cut we'll go and get it cut
i want about this much cut because i hate it when it always goes to one side or the other and i hate that
but if it is up over my shoulder it will just go back
why don't your pony down and see what you want from there
not really mom
it makes me too nervous
i remember you would go to the bridge club
yeah
i haven't done it in a couple of years though
you did it last year
as recently as last year
yes
the years don't go that fast
they do to me
oh yeah because you're getting to be so old
we could braid it or something so it wouldn't feel so heavy
would that help
mine has got a long ways to go
kenny's just about ten years younger than you
no he's just about thirteen years younger than i am
did you say thirty four in december mother
oh then you're only three years older than him
that's just like me and dana
you're three years older than who
larry
and he's the oldest
i'm the oldest
no i know of the boys
of the boys yes
and then how many years older than cliff
five
me and kenny are the same
so they're two apart
and cliff and kenny are how many years apart
eight
so you're thirteen years apart
i was your age jen when ken was born
i felt like it
oh i loved him dear and i
no
you guys have another baby
not at all interested in that at all
oh my dear it isn't a good idea at all
i'm sick of jennifer
i'm sick of dana
so what are you going to do about it
i thought about just making this in one braid dana
how about that
one braid yuck
that is so disgusting
one braid in the back
i like it
dana why don't you put your pony even lower then it wouldn't swing in front
yes it would
i hate it when it's lower because then it's not off my neck
what i like is to have it totally on
hey let's do that
no because i don't like that style
nobody will see it
but i don't like it
remember in gymnastics
how about we braid it and you wear it just the way you would in a society party
no
i do not no
i think jo you could with me tomorrow and get your hair cut too
i did it
you did it
yes
are you sure
but i don't if it stayed on
he thought you were applauding him
i think he would hear it ring
yeah but sometimes they come right like that and they don't ring
it rung
does that clock bother you at night
you would think it would but you get used to it so fast
i'm going to stick all that hair up
he went a little farther
joe almost did it
oh i hope penny isn't in any danger
how old is penny now
but if it bounces and then goes on to the ring does it count
yeah
absolutely
like if it bounced here and then goes on
i think joe got a ringer
anytime you've got your horse around the stake no matter how it got there you've got a ringer
too far
joe's are a little bit short
and daddy's are usually a little short
they're sort of about this far apart
could you go around the other way
not really
but you could have gone just around altogether
i'm voting for both of them
you're voting for both of them
do they usually count it up
oh sure
it's a competition
it is
sure
any game is
hey you know we have to figure how to work that game of yours
mine
oh yeah the gold thing
yeah we really do
it looks interesting
i'm going to play first with dad
no with me
no with dad
karen and i were going to play first
do you have to play first on everything jen
yes
with my toys i do
i like that game
i want some breakfast some breakfast some breakfast
look your bowl is there and there are two boxes of cereal in the corner in the kitchen
forget them
cheerios they're so nutritious
i hate cheerios
they have no taste whatsoever
they don't need taste
they're packed with vitamins
well eat some rice chex
have you tried rice chex
i love rice chex
how about corn flakes
no flavor in them
i need something with flavor
corn flakes
frosted corn flakes
dana we don't get sugared cereal
what are you talking about
things have not changed
you've got to pick that up girl
i'm going to clear everything up all the garbage
i want my tennis shoes
i think they're in the bed actually
well i don't really know the way
you're thinking of a prism
there is a prismatic effect in there but it's not really
dana named him and i don't like the name
if you can a rainbow on this thing then you can try
why not jen
why don't you just let me do it
no no no no
this is mine not yours
i know but you might just want to give me one and have you have one so we could have a little war going on
no
these are both mine
i have an idea
what if when dana uses it she can call it whatever she wants to call it
but you have your name for it right
but your name would be the real name
then you're going to have fun having a war without two people
god you're so mean
you could have so much fun but you're totally blind to it
it probably won't work on that plush rug
i don't believe that jenny you know sometimes you think that
he just goes
can i play with it
and he ran it out of batteries and i tried it and it didn't even work on solar power
keeran's ones worked
he was using his blue and he asked if i could use the blue car and when i came in
i don't know about that
i tried it and it didn't work
my dad said it was the batteries but he goes
i know how you feel somebody breaking your car on the first day
dad won't do it
i already asked him
dana said she already asked you
i was just waiting around
in the bed jen
ma
the butter is not melted
it was the best i could darling
try it
see if you like it
how was the cereal by the way
yucky
grandma is watering her trees
what time do you think we should leave
about eleven thirty
that sounds about right
if she had a pocket it would be perfect
should we get you a shirt with pocket jen
do you want a bribe so we can play your game
that's from dad sorry
that's from me
so that dad and i can play
oh excuse me dad
i'll give her one of each color
well i thought i you were giving her the whole thing
i'm not that stupid
i won't give her the whole thing just to play some stupid game
if it's stupid how come you want to play
because i'm interested
what conclusion do you draw from that
what conclusion do you draw from what dana is interested in
no don't dana
no
i not an egg
make like an egg and scramble dad
play me a game
are you crazy or something
i know it's too much
you can close that little window over there
jennifer i don't want to play your little game
you know it's going to rain
it's very humid out
i have two prescriptions i would like you to refill please
you know he runs around from spot to spot when i go in there you know
i killed one the other night
there were two
you know you have a cricket in your bath
he was a fraternity boy
you know all these things
you were on this morality trip back then
i think that if they lived in this area that we would happy to get together for holidays
of course we would see a lot them
and we'd get along just fine
i think that what we have in common is more than what we don't
he's very nice
i have found i got a very good reception from
well he would say all sorts of political things you know how france going down the tubes
they just had the elections
oh he's very conservative
but after all he is in fact american
you know i find it weird seeing really wholesome otherwise people smoke
like the chairman of the u c department is a very grandfatherly type
garland smokes
when did she start doing that
well we all did a bit in college
she got addicted and you didn't
well are you sorry that you stopped smoking
i wouldn't have done it
i would have done what i wanted to do
how's that
granddaddy didn't smoke did he
never
so this was a sort of wild living phase uncle bruce went through
that's right
it was one of those great sorrows of grandmother's life
that he went into wild living
well that he smokes
well it turned out that he isn't much into wild living
you wouldn't know talking to him now
did he remain methodist
or is he a catholic
no
i don't think so
is donny a catholic
yes
assuming kids are raised catholic
did anne remain a methodist
milton is methodist
i don't think they've been inside a church for a long time
when rene was visibly pregnant and not married they shot her off to lasvegas telling them they had to get married and preferably by a methodist minister
on the other hand i think maybe grandma said that so maybe it was
and it all worked out beautifully including the baby
grandma had conniptions and i think grandma took the attitude that she was standing by renee in this terrible tragedy
what was the deal
that they were living in sin for a long time
no
not renee and robert
that wasn't fashionable back in those days
what were those days
a long time ago
kids are in their teens now
mid sixties
she got pregnant while she was a college freshman and this was during the summer
the baby was born christmas day
and it was during the summer that it was discovered she was pregnant
christmas day really
she just had this one year of college which was his senior year
he was a year younger than me and had a kid
no half a year younger than you and have a kid
but she doesn't need it
she's smart enough
what did she end up doing
nothing
a nice housewife living very very
he was a senior so he graduated and he's a contractor
so she's one of the very last of the fifties wives
that's right
but you remember she's very much like her mother
renee and ann are right out of the same mold
they're beginning to look alike
they're really incredible
the easy going style
so renne the valour kids must be pushing middle age at just this point
middle age begins at fifty five
she got one foot over thirty already
sam was born in nineteen forty four
renee was born in nineteen forty four
oh my god
that's approaching the magic moment
listen the amazing thing is that pam had a child rather that late and everything is fine
isn't it
no
nowadays more and more women are having their first child at the age of thirty five
but that's dangerous
no it isn't
it's not dangerous until after forty
it's dangerouser
i wonder if the statistics will back you up on that
i think that if they do this amniocentesis women over thirty five if there's real reason to believe that they might have problems
i think a normal woman at thirty five having her first child they don't do it with
they may do it more routinely for women having their first child after the age of thirty
is that a dangerous procedure
apparently
i didn't realize that
i thought oh how marvelous
but apparently there's a
why can't they just stick a needle in
well they do
but maybe the needle might go into the wrong place
oh come on
they have all sorts of better scanning devices
i don't know
i've heard that you have whether it's important to do this or not
i don't want to have a needle stuck in me
but it certainly is marvelous for people having their first child after forty or having their first child with a complicated medical history after thirty five to know that your child is not going to have any defects
any
critical ones that they worry about
i thought that there were other genetic defects
it would show any variation in the chromosome structure right
constant comment i think my mother had that fifty years ago
hi
my name is dana
i am thirteen years old
wait a minute
shouldn't it be on record rather than play
it's on record
hi
i am dana kelley
i am the narrator for this story
i am thirteen years old and i will introduce you to the characters who will be talking
this is jinky
say hi jinky
hi
and this is woody
he is god knows thirty nine
say hi woody
and this sherry
she is thirty eight
these are the people you will be hearing on this tape
now dana be quiet
dana that was very nice
thank you
mommy can i have a pill
a what
pill
mom i'm not kidding
what did she say
i'm not kidding
she asked me if she could have a pill
but it's true
what kinds are there
do you want a aspirin pill or a stomach pill
which kind of pill do you want
that's what i don't understand
i want a stomach pill
why do you want a stomach pill
my stomach hurts
are you sure about that
i think she's just nervous
jennifer do you want the microphone on you
no
what we're supposed to be doing is having a normal conversation
okay
can i have a tissue
did you get it jen
the pill just sort of slipped down
well i bet everybody is going to feel a little bit funny until we get used to it
the problem with having an archie comic is that you won't speak
archie comic books are the kind of reading that ten year olds like
says the narrator
from now on i'm going to keep my mouth closed
is that why you got the small mouth award
you can't get me on that mommy
well now i'm going to read archie
why do you want to read archie
did you know that baseball is best on radio
i think so too
it really isn't as good on television
except for an occasional great fight when you really want to see
well that's like gymnastics
gymnastics is great on television
yeah gymnastics wouldn't be too good on radio
but that element of the sport is the same when there is simply a fantastic contortion of the body or body control or something like that
oh i just realized something
the microphone is on
it was on before when you were
do you know what's on tonight
no
i won't hear of it
do you know what you did earlier this evening and what you did earlier this evening
i'm not saying i want to
i'm just telling you
it's monday night it's shirley and laverne
i watched that once
it's stupid
i wonder if there is any way we could only get c bs occasionally
yes
do you know that soon we will be able to get public television
here
in the air
without the cable
we are soon going to be putting a super antenna
i don't want public television
who's putting that up
i don't know
but they petitioned the city to put it up and i guess it's just caught up in red tape
who petitioned the library
i don't know what it is
it needs an antenna that the zoning plans and it means that whether you'll be able to get public television whether you're on cable or not
because they'll pick up the signal and rebroadcast it
i don't know
well what do you mean we'll be able to get every channel
no just public television
we'll be able to get public television which has some pretty nice stuff
like what
then if we could just unget c b
stupid concerts with people of the public
no
they have on these great movies these great old movies
they often have wonderful series from england
that's right upstairs downstairs peter whimsey the mysteries
they're really good
you know i kind of miss peterwhimsey every once in a while
all i remember is the rumpoles
how about that great science fiction show doctor who
it's on here
it's been on here for the last three years
i don't know
it's hard for me to know
i hate public television
he said you were doing so brilliantly he was going to put in six more rubber bands
jen would you like some salad
want some more brocolli
i want some dessert
we've got little oranges
we have peaches
stop it jennifer
i'm so sorry
no we have them both
does it not taste good
it tastes terrible
is this what they call a hands experience
jennifer you're doing the dishes tonight
no i'm not
yes you are
make me
i'm not doing the dishes
no that wouldn't get the dishes done
really i'm not doing the dishes
really you are
i said i didn't want to come to the table
but notice where you are
you are at the table
that's true right
dana do you want more rice
don't put the top back on
don't put the top back on
that's only with coke
well dana we have figured out that jenny's team cannot possibly do any worse than first place
oh my god that's terrible
if they lose every game and one of the teams wins all of three of their games
dana the only issue is whether you're going to get four five or six points out of three games
i don't think they will though
no i would just like the green team to tie brit's
no i would like the green team to beat brit's
yeah so would i
it's not brit's team
that's right
we are identifying it as brit's team but it isn't brit's team
we should say julie's team
no
we should say the cone team
yeah and also
yeah the coneheads
who scored the goal in the game
it was the coach's daughter
no it was not
that's the library person
that was the bosworth girl
oh that's even better
see they do
the green you're talking about the green
no about the person who scored the one goal
that's not true
it doesn't matter
it doesn't really matter
no i was telling you that they put up a strong front line which meant that we should be able to control it in mid field
weren't you trying to get four forwards against them
no
who was it then
much better to run a defense person against them because i'm hiding people in the center not up front any more
we did better against them when i hid people up front
am i crazy
we're talking about soccer
am i really doing this
talking about soccer
about kid soccer yes
daddy i've got a good idea
do you think that we should go to watch the girl's high school soccer team
i think that that would be fun
let's keep an eye out for
by the way j j's got a party going
i want a haloween party for once
every year it's j j's party
oh does she want something else
oh no
have you even listened to half the things she's wanted in the last hour
we don't have that much paper
even with the university supplying it
oh come on
i don't think you have that much brain dad and you're pretty smart
he is
that depends on whether i give her everything she asks for or not
if i do i'm pretty smart
hey dad will you go out and get some ice cream
yeah dad you're pretty smart dad
and if he doesn't
what were all the things that were wrong with our car mom
i'll show you the bill then we'll go through it
no it was exactly what either what i knew was wrong or had to have checked
okay because there are little oranges which you can have or peaches
we don't want any
i might be willing to go and get some ice cream in a while but i'm not going to do it right now
probably after dishes right
are you kidding
we just got a humongous bill for the car
well we're lucky
we got everything up to the catalytic converter
the catalytic converter just cost us three hundred fifty dollars
on the bottom of the car there tail muffler pieced into the catalytic converter
oh my god
i'm glad you didn't get the car
we should have had the car in there a long time ago really
nope when the whole thing snapped it was all gone it was because it was rusted through
are you talking about the car
year i just had the whole thing replaced
you got a new car
no no no a new muffler
as well the lights
also a new light
what about a tire
were they able to resurrect that tire
they resurrected a tire and they put the four snows on
and they put what
the four snow tires on
and they did the lube and oil change
and the air filter apparently was almost disintegrated
maybe that was the sound we were hearing
no no no the air filter was
no i don't mean that we heard it disintegrating but that we heard that it wasn't doing its job
that could be
it was the engine really i'm pretty sure
that could be
since the oil was dirty and we had to get a whole new set of sparks
oh my gosh
well that's not bad but then they retuned the when they put in the new sparks they also retuned the valve the valve timing
sparks
the sparks are spark plugs
what do the spark plugs do
they provide electricity or energy that you need when air and gas are going to get mixed up and burn
so its like a match on a piece of paper
you've got to have the paper and you have to have the air and you have to make it pop someplace to make it burn right
the spark does that
in six different places in the car its going boom boom boom like little explosions inside the car and its pushing a big it's pushing what's called a piston just a thing down and that thing down is turning a wheel
that thing that's turning the wheel eventually turns the wheels of the car
and that's how a car runs
sounds pretty primitive doesn't it
yet when you stop to think about it we get an awful lot of mileage and speed and stuff out of something that's a pretty primitive system
how much do chevrolets cost now
eight thousand dollars
we went by the car show at the
eight thousand dollars is right
that's not much
that's a stripped down chevrolet too probably isn't it
jenny that was the little chevrolet
that was a car not even as big as our car
our car would be ten thousand dollars would you say
our car no
our car right now is costing me
it's still a very good buy
i thing it's costing at least this past year i don't know the new modern prices
this past year it was costing a little over eight thousand dollars for that ford fairmont
we paid forty five hundred dollars
well do you realize we can't afford to ever buy a new car
it's true
this is it
we'll have to walk to peg and
no we'll have to take very good care of our car
are you serious
no
i'm serious
i think of the abels and certainly the people we know with a car
certainly of the people we know the abels could afford a new car if they had to
but right now a new car would cost them essentially as much as their boat did a couple years ago right
oh i don't know
well their boat was ten thousand dollars and
dad why don't you just use a spoon
i get some too
yeah
yeah it has to be divided evenly
the person who divvies it up is the person who gets second choice don't forget
gets second choice
don't use your fingers
yuck
jennifer the just drop it into bowls
just kidding
what
where can i punch him
i touched both bowls dad
dad come on
don't
she's doing her best
don't fuss
come on
she is
i'm not
okay i won't touch it
good
dad a larger spoon would make sense dana
okay you're getting the ones that go on the floor
that's a requirement
i don't care
i said i'm nothing special
you don't know which is yours
dad we have to start thinking about halloween really
okay
come on
jenny you pick the one you want
keep in mind that two of them are going to dana
wait
why are you giving her that one
okay
i'm taking this
you didn't have to put them in there
you're right
i didn't
take them out
do what you want with them
i don't care
what for generations have called martyrdom
martyrdom
oh wait a minute
wait a minute
there are exactly six left in the can which means four for jinky and two for dana
these oranges taste like poison
don't eat them then
mom i'm still thinking about the marriott hotel
marriott
the marriott
is that what you said
the marriott
oh that was a nice
the one in kansas city
did i tell you
no the wonderful one in syracuse
mom and dad grandma where was that
remember the one in kansas city fell down last year
i don't think that was the marriott
was it the marriott or the hyatthouse
yeah i think it was the hyatthouse
yeah hyatthouse
it had such a wonderful swimming
wasn't that the one where you walked in and it was so warm
yes
it was delicious
well that's not quite the word for it but
want a bit of my cabbage
no
it was like a sauna
the whole room was
want any more of the
no i have it
dad you know how hot a sauna is
the whole room was like a sauna
yeah but then you don't want to leave there that's the problem
so you get dressed in it so you'll be warm then
i would think something between that and what's out at the sheridan would be about right
is the sheridan cold
well the water is cold
is the air cold
no the air is kind of warm
mom i thought the water it was warm
we're talking about
no no we're talking about when we've gone swimming there that one time in the summer
we were all freezing
remember you were going to give me a little something if i wouldn't get out of the water
was i really
yes
and i never got anything
you didn't need anything
now i think he's the sore sort
you didn't have those lessons
you didn't know how to swim
i didn't know how to swim
no you didn't need the lessons because you didn't know how to swim
they taught me nothing
i don't agree jenny
i think they did teach you something and if you'd paid attention you would have learned even more
one thing that kept you though jinky is what they did is they kept you in the water when you had just learned to swim
that's the swim
they were trying to teach me to dive
you know how i learned to dive
watching j j dive
well very often only people who really think they
i was so embarrassed that i couldn't dive that i just dove
you still don't dive right
when we'd go to butter over this summer she never dove
she she has the notion of diving
i know how to dive
i know how to dive
it's not a jump
nope
when you roughly get in head first
i've never seen you dive
i've seen her dive at that cass park
yeah
i was diving all the time dana
you were doing it at the farm
the swimming pool at the farm
the thing of it is she doesn't have the kind of spring so that she goes up and down so her feet come straight down in the water
i do it like a
well you don't do it even then you leave your knees bent
you're doing pretty well jennifer considering that you've had no instruction
you're now at the stage where someone could really teach you how to do a pretty one
you think
dana does the same thing as me
i know
is j j taking swimming lessons this year
he's past shark
boy standards have really come down
hush a minute
what lessons was he taking jenny
it's junior lifesaver i think
is it through the y
yes
i haven't even passed
no honey it's at the high school
okay we've got to call the y and find out about their lessons
not about their competitive teams but the lessons
you guys i haven't even passed
i just passed intermediate two years ago
now i know how jay swims and the whole notion that he that any kid underage well even jason's age
jason can't
jason can't swim very well
well i know that but what i'm saying is that i don't understand what's happening
i don't think the programs a good program is what i'm leading to
he's been taking swimming lessons a long time and he's gone straight ahead
i mean a person just can't go there for a long long time and not pass something
i think you're probably right
i think he really is learning something
well what we wanted to find out about are those lessons
jenny's not interested in the competitive business
not until i get to something like shark
i'm interested in the competitive business
you needn't tell me that
i can guess that
i think dana can you arrange to go with rachel one afternoon
yeah
okay now here's one of the problems we're looking at
jennifer let me just explain this to you
the lessons usually are one day a week
jenny that's on the computer
every time dad starts talking you go professor
what
sorry
you can start over if you want
the and the swimming team thing is every day
mom stop doing that it's really distracting me
well don't let it distract you
well why
okay
did you hear what i said though jenny
yeah
okay
so you have to decide how often you want to swim
do you want to swim
once a week
once a week
okay then it's alright
i'm soon going to be up to him
in about a month
maybe not jenny
that's true
if you're not it's nothing damaging
they should teach me how to dive with my legs straight
so we've got to find about the y lessons for jinky and we've got to find out about the y's competitive program for dana
no
the high school's competitive thing
it's in the high school
no its not
but it's the y program
rachel isn't in the y program
yes she is honey
rachel's in the y program out at teagle
that's the competitive team
the lessons that they give at the high school
yeah
the high school is so warm
it's even warmer than the small pool in the right
oh goody maybe you'd just like to take lessons in it right
but it's got a basketball net and a diving board
i think i'm about ready to turn in for the night
oh i wonder if the news is coming on
for what
for what
turn it off if you're going to have that on mom why are you listening to the news
because something may have happened that i want to know about
yeah there have been so many assassinations that you begin to suspect that he died
mom you said that you'd loan me ten cents
now
now
now
but i don't have it now now now
my god you don't even have it in the kitchen
i hate it the way you tease that way
it's not funny
well you don't do that
don't touch her dana
why'd you do that
wait a minute
wait a minute
dana you come over here
you clear the table and you do the dishes
i don't clear the table
that's her job
it's nicer to get it over with quickly
i can't wait until halloween
what do i want to be for halloween
how about a chimney sweep
what about a letterman
what were you thinking of
letterman
how about orphan annie
what about letterman
letterman
that's a joke that wouldn't go off
i don't think that anybody
when you did it it was very much the central focus so because electric company had just appeared
you should be a cornell
just be a cornell professor
that will freak people out
are you a professor
yes
disgusting isn't it
no
he's bo derek
i think it's going to be a long squalid summer
it might be considered a squaw winter

no
i'm amazed
how about big ones
she meant one of those bigger ones
still not three hundred
no couldn't be dana
yogurt is like five hundred
three hundred
a carton of yogurt is probably more like two hundred
that's why people eat it when they're on diets
that's got a lot calories
but it's very filling and it's very nutritious
yeah but the taste
do you not like yogurt
i like it but
do you ever have a chance to get it for school lunch
no
too expensive for me

i didn't realize he had two doubles in minnesota
that would be yesterday
did they win in minnesota
they said his overall average for having done so badly even with the first ten even twenty games or eighteen games his overall average for the second part is now two hundred seventy
it's better than one hundred ninety eight
well no his combined average is now about two twenty
the first half it was one ninety eight
yes that's right
isn't that awful
yes
especially since winfield didn't
winfield's having trouble now
winfield's has been going down
dana you like winfield
and you know who's going up
reggie
mumphrey
mumphrey
mumphrey was already high too
mumphrey
where did they get mumphrey from
he's the one who made two two wait let me say it two triples and a home run
i know
where did they get mumphrey from woody
they got him from the same team that winfield came from
houston astros
oh no san diego padres that's right
well i know that's where winfield came from
yeah now the other thing is that a
what is
do you do they didn't trade him
boy they were stupid to
he was a free agent too
oh he was a free agent
yeah
do you that reggie picked up on friday night out there in front of us over thirty one dollars and put it in his pocket
how did that get reported
in in tonight's paper
well we saw him do it
oh no and then he got something like twelve dollars the next night but on sunday he had been getting so many hits he got a home run on saturday he had been getting so many hits they only threw him one dollar
ninety
okay
why did they only throw him one dollar
ninety
he didn't need money any more
he's going to have his contract renewed
that's right
really
oh he's a free agent so he if he goes on the market somebody like the white sox who have a short left field fence will pay him a million dollars even
so even if he gets to the point when he can't play the outfield you saw the way he was running the bases there he loves to run bases and he's fast but he doesn't do any outfield as concentrate
who reggie
i think he's a great outfielder
and that's it
and i think as a who was it ralph boston said quite correctly that's part of his part of a sign of probably being a fairly savvy guy a smart guy
it's really boring in the outfield
it's hard to concentrate during the season
that's what i hear
i stink in the outfield
i like first base better
i like spencer he's first base isn't he
no spencer was traded
watson's first base
spencer who
jim spencer was traded away
jennifer will you eat that over your plate
who who was he traded to
i'm not certain detroit maybe just not certain
i think
the tigers are doing okay this year
the tigers are good this year
why is it that nobody likes my vegetables
look over there to your left
we didn't even realize they were there
would you have eaten any
yeah
we never like vegetables
we don't like your kind of vegetables
i like your tomatoes
yeah your tomatoes are good
want another tomato each
yeah
yeah
i want that one

yes mother dear
but no sleeping over that i changed my mind
rebecca too
yes
dana lifted off and you saw what happened right
oh yeah
i didn't want her to sleep over so it really doesn't matter
that's right
if it did matter she would have put pressure on me and i would have backed down
really
probably i can't really hold out very well
you hold out good to me
okay
i really don't think but on some things i hold out very well
i can be very firm
rebecca canceled on them why can't

all my life
yeah it looks nice it suits her
okay now jink i have to
jinky you have to put your feet down i have to have your back the back of your hair away from the back of the chair otherwise i can't get to it okay

mumble mumble you're supposed to do those things for self dana
i do
you don't need me to reward you for that stuff
am i all done
want me to go over it
go over it quickly
use a different brush to go over it
oh look at that
oh woody look
woody
yes
turn around let me see your face
you do have bit of a problem
i'll just try to brush it out rather loosely right now and i'll take it piece by piece
look at it
no i do not want to hear it
want to see
that's why i'm doing it right
yeah
must be plugged in
oh it sure is jinky
i really think you should start washing it about every four or five days
i told i told her because of itch
it looks so wonderful
because it was itching i thought she should wash i told her to wash it twice this time and she then she should wash it again in two or three days
i'll wash it tomorrow morning
i'll wash it tomorrow morning
you don't need to do that
yes i do because it its it's still itching
but will need to wash it again in a couple of days
i really know her mom
are you ready
isn't that charming
it's charming mother
now turn your head sideways jenny
now get your hands out of your hair
scratch me
okay jenny have you got your
that's where you touch the brush pretty hard
in the
put yours away use your comb
like that
no
yeah i know
could i just
no no no
touch the brush
no you can't
i have to finish there's a long job in front of me here
it feels so good
it looks so good
today is tuesday right
don't do that
it wrinkles up your face
ouch
my face will wrinkle quickly
dad i'm sorry
we got we got a bad place
we got a bad place now
everybody's worried about getting their period
i don't give a shit
i mean i don't give well
dad please be careful
okay okay
we have a real knot in the hair here
now i'm going to pull apart again
so you kind of hold it up there and help me out okay
good we're really this now
you kind of hold
will you show me the rat
well it's only half a rat now
there are two half rats
hey just take it out
well you can't just take it out
you have to comb it out
ouch
okay
take bit by bit
look at this small bit that i'm taking
that's it
well take a little bit of it
well we got this part
now what you need to do jinky is to hold your head back toward me a little bit
and turn to the side more
turn this way more
that's it
and back this way
i want you right up there
i want you good
the problem is there is another problem with this you know doing your hair and that is as we
hey oh no ever find me you scratch it undoes it jinky
which will jinky no
i can't help it
dad you going to have to tie my hands to stop me from itching
how about tying you to the chair
i know the padlock to my bicycle
go get it
no we're okay
itch itch on the other side for now
but the other side doesn't hurt for when my hair on this side
okay we're getting it
no we aren't
yeah we are
well most of it isn't bad
remember the first bit i did had nothing bad in it
i don't believe that dad
you may say that but it doesn't feel it
well now we're getting a lot electricity is what we're getting now in the hair and that makes it more complicated
i want you to keep your head to the side so i will keep it to the front
i've already done part
that's very important okay
i like the way mom does it
she holds it while she
okay i am holding too
that hurts
well this is very very messy hair
that's why it hurts
no it isn't
it's because you're brushing it too hard
that's why it hurts
she said that with fervor right
honey what if i put the brass candle on the piano
that'll be alright
you might as well give up and just braid it up
no we've got to do now it we're ever going to get it done
actually i have a fair amount of it kind of done jenny
maybe the first fifth of it done
look at this
look at this
the whole brush full of hair we can actually go through now
now let's try to take this
go underneath
that feels sort of good too
go up near
yeah what you like is that
jink take this part in front
just hold it there for a second
don't do anything else with it yeah
see it it's possible that i can kind of tease most of these small rats just by brushing very lightly through the hair and then doing the same thing underneath
well should i try that
underneath it isn't going to be the best
underneath it really isn't the matter
yeah it does
it's not as much as outside as outside
that's true
go check out the lamps when you're finished jink
is cutting my hair
where
no no no
i can do it
that's not the question
i don't want her hair cut
stand up and turn around jinky and let daddy see
it really needs to be cut with this
well i think it has two feet to go before it needs to be cut
look
my thought was
turn your head back jink
that we shape it so that it woody look so it was all even in about right here
that's okay
add two more inches
add two more inches
no she's already said that that's what she wants
add two more inches
you mean up higher
no lower
subtract two more inches
i need a comb
that is what i need
i shall be back
it's just the same as what the beautician did last time
i can do it as well she can
yeah it's true
i had that much done with me
your hair is longer than mine at this point
right now i had last year on my birthday i had my hair cut
i think she was carrying too much hair
when added to her weighty years it burdened her
okay no faces
jennifer turn your head down
you know who i thought looked really cute of the babies we saw
out of lucas and michael and matthew
do you remember which one out of those three i thought was really cute
which one
guess
lucas
lucas
michael i mean matthew
you both think the others were matthew and lucas
you're both wrong
i thought michael michael john was so cute
yes he is cute
okay hands off jen
hands off
when you're done you're going to that for an hour
no i'm not
i just trimming it
it kind of
big cheering crowd here
wow that was hard
mom likes to do this
dad yours is like
no it's not
it's good
okay jink i need you to go the other way
i need you to turn
hey i need you to go this way now
okay good
look how good he's coming along with my hair
jinky i need you to turn all the way around and turn the chair around
jinky get up off the chair
get up off the chair
oh over here
okay we'll start from here up front
turn all the way around this way
that's it
start from the front
keep your hand off her hair dana
i'm sorry i'm sorry i worked very hard to do this
i wasn't going to ruin it
but you can't tell
this side isn't and it's
oh it's horribly worse
really
no it's not
we'll be done within five minutes
jinky turn your head this way
come on now i need cooperation
this is the tricky part right up in here
just a minute
move move your chair up towards jinky's
can i get up
not too much
be careful there okay dad
i can see it
there's there's some rats here
be careful
okay
okay
now move this over
we're okay
i don't know if i feel okay
see if it works i should be able to run my fingers through too
get a comb instead of your fingers
no
just put your
jennifer you must stop scratching when i
in my hair and don't feel that all that dirt gunk
turn back this way now
i still have this difficult part to do
jinky back farther even
that's it
see what i'm trying to do
rather than do it all at once just do it bit by bit
you know i can cut dana's hair but it might be a disaster
what you're cutting or dana's hair
dad
you're done
almost
i've just got to make sure it's straight
i would say jink we're moving right along here
oh my god dad look
let me see
stop for a second dad
no no please don't jink keep your head turned
i don't want to lose it
just a few places
we just keep working on it here
ouch
don't use your fingers
oh that's the test
if i can get my fingers through it's pretty straight
i'm getting my fingers through pretty well now
a few hang here
turn back
then you have to bury that okay
i have a thesis chapter to read tonight
don't cut too much more mom
i'm not honey i'm just it
okay
don't cut any more
just a bit
she has to make even
see your hair has a twist in it kind of sticks out a little bit
it's hard to see to see thing is
yeah it it really not a good idea to cut hair when it's clean
well and or unless it's very wet
okay turn around and let daddy see
that's good
that's good
is it short
no
it really looks a lot better
its about this far below your shoulders
jennifer would you keep your head
would you keep your head
what do you mean how was it before
it was straggly
it kind of hung down like those with
oh i think that's terrific
i did a good job
yeah it makes her look very girl
better than the beautician did
i think so
we didn't want the beauticians on our block
jeannie wait i'll show you how you can see what i've done
come on
going to set up a double mirror
oh my god my hair is too short
it is not dana
it is not
you look most of most of your life with shorter hair
actually it will grow out pretty quickly
can you see the back
it makes it look a lot thicker
yeah
okay jennifer you're done
you have to braid it now
but not a little
what's
mom
oh golly it's nice
it looks behind is it
keep your no no keep your hand out
keep your hand don't you do that
i'm just
you do one thing better than me
i'm better at cry
i'm better at my mouth
i'm better at being myself
i'm better at bullshit
that's true
if this french question isn't true then it's alright
certainly is
i'm trying to get all the way through all the hair
okay
turn around this way now
hey be careful
stand up
i found some underneath that wasn't done quite before
it's pretty clear
we're getting it
we're coming right across
hold head back please
hold your head back please
oh no

i know
okay do we have
we cut off about four inches didn't we
do we have a comb we can use for jennifer braid
four inches about
let me have the comb
we'll braid it right now and we'll be done
i would say four inches on the longest stride which probably won't be two inches on the side hair
yeah you've got to do my part aren't you
now i want you back back i want you straight back
isn't that nice
swing
is it too short
does it make you unhappy
no

unless it gets about this much longer you can cut it
you want me to trim it tomorrow night so that it will be in good shape by the time school starts
my hair
no your fringe
yeah
you know how ruth does it
or maja
she cuts it about to there and wants it to curl
isn't that gross
it's alright
maja doesn't mind
you know when you're about five or six years old or seven there are many more things you can do with hair than when you're thirteen
come on dana
you know why bill went off went off the little dive when he was three
because he didn't know the feel of it
now ephraim he would know the feel of it
come on dana
i went off when i was three
unhunh
yeah
we weren't in ithaca
come on
i just still have to get this last little bottom piece

that looks good
okay do it right down there
just at the bottom
now now look that messes it up
i will not do it jink
keep your head
okay okay
if you don't want to do it don't do it
but if i want to tell you to do it i can tell you to do it
but you don't have to do it
thanks
fast
now hold it
now what i thought i'd do
now all you have to do is get inside and press
that doesn't do anything to the hair
okay now jink hold this hold this part of your hair down there
turn this way to me
where are your baubles

i'm doing it softly now
so i turn my head
i hope that's okay with the master of the house
it's not
or the big shot
oh getting lippy in your old age kid
keep your head to the side now while i
i'm not in old age
you're older than me and you aren't old

unfortunately
i think i have
turn your head to the side now a little more
to the side more good
thanks
keep it to the side please
good
oh jink don't do that
can you keep it to the side jink
thanks
i am
dad can you tell the difference when i'm looking at this science book while you're braiding
i would rather that you wouldn't while i'm doing the braiding
i'm trying to do this to get all the both sides equal and all three strands equal on both sides
why won't it stop itching dad
turn this way for me now
now hold it
all the way back
i'm going to have to comb it again
i'd like for you to move your shoulder forward and your head back
that's it
i wonder if i've got fleas in my hair
now see how easy this one was
wait let me find the other bauble
i know it's not on the piano
you found it
yeah
okay shoulder forward shoulder forward head to the side
it's kind of hard
i know
and also
and keep the comb off the hair
it's just on my bangs
no no
i have to do this again
so you brush my bangs
i have to do this again
i have to distinguish between the bang and the rest
hope this sets the pattern for the next week or so
what's wrong with doing my bangs longer
jennifer be quiet
now
keep your head to the side
that's good
you always have to have your way
yeah
i did it because you talked to me
except mom i don't understand why my head hurts
it always itches
it still itches honey
yeah it does
alright i'll tell you what
we're going to go see the doctor
right here
right here
just feel it with your fingernail
doesn't it feel like some dirt
no darling
you've gotten it good and clean
there are no bumps there is no dirt
could be
it may just be because you've just washed it now
but mom it's been happening all month
i know it has
you're going to the doctor in about three weeks and we'll find out then
three weeks
i can't wait three weeks mom
well i'll look at the drug store tomorrow and see if i can find anything for itchy scalps
ask go to the drug store and ask for prescriptions for scalps
it hurts it itches on my bangs and the top itches back here under my braids at the center of my head on these sides
smack in the center of your head jink
you have beautiful braids
okay jink
lean back now and let me take a look at you hair now where it itches
does it itch right along there
yeah
if i had to guess i would guess
wait wait
look
see it
yeah
what is that
i don't know
let's assume that it's only yes they're crawling all over
look at that woody
yeah
i see
let's assume that they're mites
yes
wash your hands now sherri
i've got mites
i don't know
i've got no idea what mites are
let's look them up
i'm going to wash my hands first
no wonder i couldn't get them out
they're teensie weensie
okay honey you have a reason for itching
i want right
now wait now wait
now that we know and have seen them we can do something about it
i don't want to sleep with mites
how many are there
about a hundred
no
one thousand
i that
what did i do
sitting here i'm going to knock the hell out of you
if you say any word right now
i know right away what you can do
you could knock the hell out of me sure
okay that's enough
jenny you got a hit
i know what you were doing at rebecca's
you can tell right away
watching television
no we weren't
i don't believe you
look i'm very hungry
let me eat my food
oh it's grub it's grub madness
i hate this toast
a good meal
have i eaten enough
i swear to god at rebecca's house we were doing silly crazy whatever it's called it was red and what happens is you know what it does
were not interested
i am interested
what does it do honey
do you know what it does
pay no attention to her she
anyway it's so good it's so neat
okay you put it in water make a of water
you can squirt it in water and it makes castles under water
guess what
you can scoop it out out of a spin
can you guess
perfectly dry and you pour it and it's like a sand sandy all sandy and then when it hits the water it's gets all ploppy and looks like goop
what is it
i think it's it's sand that has
salt in it or something
it's kind of thing it maybe it may be that it has this thing around it
it has this thing in that will not mix with water and there it forms a resistance around it
that will not let it get wet and then it will resistance when it comes out of water
i don't know
it might just be plastic coated i don't know
it couldn't be plastic coated because then it wouldn't get all gloppy when it was in the water
i don't know
how about a styrofoamie sort of thing that doesn't get gloppy when it's in water
it's sand when it's out of water
what's it called
and we kept doing it and doing it and doing it it was so boring
you called me
without being one piece of cake
it was terrible
i mean she made it and it was really good but it wasn't the kind of cake
that you like
it was zucchini bread
it was her first zucchini bread but i'm still hungry
i hate this toast
that is enough dana
get up and do something about it then
throw it away
it away
excuse me woman
somebody eat this piece of bacon
it's just a little scrap
i know
that's why i ate it
you said you were going to eat it
you said you didn't want any
so
throw it away
i think you're looking for a fight
that was my piece of bacon
jenny no jenny

two tall towers
wall in the hall
well here here's a wall right here
the wall is getting taller and taller
it's a tall wall
don't fall off tall walls
the tall wall falls very nicely
how do you make a bed with blocks

you need to have four posts right
and then you need to have a mattress in the middle
you could make the mattress out of these skinny ones
that's right
line them up next to
you've got to realize that you're dealing with a symmetry freak here
the mattress has to be very even or it won't pass inspection
yes that is a red one

good show brendon
you're going to be army engineer i can tell

hello how are you
doing well
honey
no
okay
yeah
uh no
maybe
right out in front
well trish will be here if i'm not
she's at the green star right now
oh
well she's working somewhere so track her down
so i'm watching the kids
and then and then when she comes home i'm going up to school but actually do you mean an hour and a half or for an hour and a half
oh okay
oh well
so i'm expendable huh
let me just check the sides to be sure
okay hold on for just a second
no honey honey
okay
hi sweetheart
good
no we don't have a radio
we for the gales
no
i don't know ask andre
okay how's it going
barb barbara salomon stopped by
she lives around the corner and does day
and vaguely knows of the tucker's
and she just left her name and number and suggested that sometimes if you guys are going stir in the cold weather that you get together and form a little social support group
yes
real well
he brought over some of his own toys today
a couple of leggo style trains and um a of blocks
battery operated
and there seems to be an awful lot less competition between them today
i think we should recommend to kathy that she always bring some things of his or leave a few
yeah
and just rotate them
because they're getting along really well
brendon has nudged joshua once in the last hour and a half and that's it
that's possible too
he might not feel as much competition
because right now they're playing with blocks and crayons
that are not joshua's and they are still doing fine together
okay we'll see you soon
love you very much
take care
byebye
that was mama brendon
she's going to be home in an hour
joshua look for another one just like it see
look here is another yellow wedge
see there is more than one of each kind of these blocks honey
and so if joshua has one and you want it before you take it you should ask him before you take it
duplicate
what's the matter honey
want to share some of joshua's toys now that he is sharing yours
how was your day at school joshua

oh dear
brendon if you do pretend spraying you can clean anything you want

that's all
i think we ought to take him upstairs
why don't we bring brendon down
because he was
oh

yes
we have him at a play group at cornell

do you like to play with brendon

eric and jane were friends and they both liked to use tools
when they put all of their tools together they had a hammer a screwdriver a saw a pair of pliers a measuring tape a wrench two flashlights an oil can a drill two paint brushes and some paint
eric's mother gave them a tool box to put the tools in
it was too heavy to carry so they put the box into jane's wagon
let's use our tools to help our neighbors
eric suggested
that's a good idea
said jane and they started off pulling the wagon down the sidewalk together
miss campbell had just finished putting up a new mailbox when jane and eric reached her house
they showed her all the things in their tool and miss campell asked if they would use their paint and brushes to decorate her mailbox
eric and jane painted it white with bright blue stripes
miss campell was very pleased

i'm making this
you going to put some blocks on brendon
i'm making this for me

why don't you let him put the block up
oopsie
okay
i'm sure that's
that's alright
that's alright you can build it back up again can't you
um he's recording them for somebody who's doing a what
language studies
children's language studies
the same study that we did last year
they did it oh last year too with josh and brendon so this guy asked him to do it again so now they have an updated version of the
quite updated because it was a year ago in the fall i think

that's going to tip
you want to straighten it up a little
shove the blocks over towards josh
that's right
it's not tipping as much any more

foundations keep things from tipping over
by being very strong and very heavy
