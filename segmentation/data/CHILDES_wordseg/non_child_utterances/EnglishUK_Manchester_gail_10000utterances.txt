fishing in the canal
well
not
looking for something in the canal
and we might see olwin
would you like to see olwin
she'll be at work
you want to pick up with olwin
that would be nice
she'd like that
but she'll be at work so it might be embarrassing if you run to the front of court and give her a big hug
but you can try
and who else'll we'll see
we'll see did we see mummy's friend on the tellie
peter didn't we yesterday
he was talking about it
on the tellie

it was just on the tellie
an ordinary program

are there any bubbles in there
it's a bubble is it
i thought it was an onion
oh
uhoh
that's not what you do is it
what do you say
it's alright
what do you think
well
you can pretend it's a bubble if you want
perhaps you'd better get everything out of that before you sit in there
because you might be squashing things
do you want to get out and take everything out first
no
you can get back
no
you can get back in
but tip everything out first
yeah
are you
where're we going on holiday
can you remember
france
what did you say
where're we going on holiday
with mummy and daddy and andy
where're we going
that's right
yes
no
the ones with flags weren't there were they
the ones with flags were at the new waitrose
at granny's
at newark
but they do have little trolleys at centre parcs
but we're going somewhere like centre parcs called oasis
and i don't know if they'll have little trolleys there
they'll have a big swimming pool
it's like centre parcs but it's not the same
it's very similar but it's in a different place
and it'll be posher
and nicer
maybe
maybe
well
yeah
put it in the trolley and then in the bag when you've paid the lady
or the man
think it'll be a lady
we'll go swimming
we'll go swimming
what else do we do there
we'll go to see uncle mark on the way aren't we
you willn't swim with mark
we'll just see mark
mark's got a big clock like our clock
do you remember it
where you have to knock on the door
and you knock on it don't you
and he opens it for you
knock
you look at the pendulum going tick
and when we went to see mark last time
we went to see father christmas on a train
do you remember that
round and round train
no
it wasn't a round and round train
it was a proper steam train like thomas
and father christmas came to see us
and then we got stuck in snow
do you remember that
do you remember that
it was terrible
the car was slipping and sliding all over the place
and we nearly crashed lots of times didn't we
crash like that
and then on the way back we're going to see chris
what does chris make
a car like that one
what does chris make with you
what do you do
what do you do
that's right
we're going to see him
he likes in leeds
and then we might go to eureka
you know eureka
you you wouldn't like to go
it's a museum where there's lots of things for you to do
um i don't think chris will have many toys but we might take some with us
lady's toys
chris might have a few toys
i think he's got a paddington bear
that his mummy made him when he was a little boy
yeah
you want to look at chris's bed
what
the one he slept in when he came here
he's going to make you a special bed on the floor
well
i don't think it'll be like that one
bit bit bigger than that
and um we might go shopping in leeds again
because mummy likes it there
and spends lots of money
would that be good
to go shopping in leeds
we might see uncle daniel
but he never turns up so we may not bother
knock on the door
whose door
daniel's door
well
i don't know if we'll bother telling him we're going
because he never turns up in time does he
he's a bit dopey your my brother
did did you know that daniel is mummy's brother
like andy's your brother
daniel's my brother
what's caroline called
well
i've got a brother
oh
called richard
richard
and richard's a doctor
oh
that's your brother
do you think andy might be a doctor one day

are you going to be a doctor
a lawyer
just a gail
good girl
very sensible
becky
do you remember becky
becky's mummy's cousin
she's at college learning how to be a doctor
so one day she'll be a doctor

it would be a long way for her to come
not next week
no
i'm coming
because where are we next week

we're away so caroline can't come
because we're a long way away
yeah
so
daddy's going to
pretend to eat it
oh
daddy will be pleased to have a holiday willn't he
because he's been very very busy
he was a bit fed up
well
what did you say
becky's learning how to be a doctor
she might do one day
i don't think she's ever been here actually
she's at newcastle
that's where she's learning
and do you remember simon
that's becky's brother
he's gonna going to be a speech
when he can get a job
i don't think he'll come
doesn't seem very likely
maybe one day
he hasn't got a job at the moment
he's looking for a job
and who else do you know
no
you can't get in that one
because you'll squash all the books
which includes the library books
can you tell caroline who wrote go to

we though oh how do you know that

let's shut the door to keep the cold out
the tiger
did you read that story in the paper
i don't know why i tell you these things
a tiger bit off a man's arm
chewed it all up
that's a bit horrible
don't think he fits
i think you might just have to put him in rather than click him in
have a look at his feet
has his feet got holes in
might work mightn't it
but his tail's in the way you see
oh
his tail gets in the way of clicking him into the holes
never mind
he'll just have to rest there willn't he
oh
what a very high tower you're building
andy would love to knock that down wouldn't he
think by next week he'll be crawling towards that
oh
oh dear
you didn't need andy to knock it down
it fell down on it's own
what can't you do
well
actually something happened to the man didn't it
what happened to the man

never mind
silly me
you did it today
no
you didn't do it today did you
yeah
you did it at your old play

you'll have to come away
caroline willn't willn't be able to hear that when she has to listen to it
you're too close
don't touch it
no

because from here you can see the point little pointers

what do think
they're putting in new pipes you know
make our radiators work properly
they are
and you know what they did the other day
we didn't see it
but the men that were digging
there was a pipe under the ground with water in it to bring water so that you can flush the loo and have a bath
and the men chopped through a pipe
and the water went everywhere
and it flooded into some people's houses
just down the road
some people opened their front door and all this water came rushing in
no
but two people rang mummy and they thought it was at our house
no
we were lucky
it was just down the road though
i didn't
i i said to them no
there's no water round here
it was only about fifty yards away
yeah
that would've been a disaster wouldn't it
it would've rushed in
and it might've got in their tellie
and all our carpets
on the buggy

it was a bit of a disaster but they mended it in time
and you have to find him under here

and got it
oh
that was clever
do you think we need our tree chopping
you know that tree used to be absolutely enormous
our tree did
before we came it used to be as high as the house
and they chopped it down
and then it started to grow again
before we lived here
absolutely enormous it was
it was taller than the house i think
and when the cut it down they had to close the road
they had to say no cars can come down this road because we're chopping this big tree down
that must've been good mustn't it

do a really cross face and don't smile
don't smile
it is a bit tricky for you when you've got a funny mummy like you have isn't it
you see if mummy can not smile
i can't do it either
let's try again
neither of us can do it can we
you lasted longer than me you funny girl
let's do it again

you know
mummy's seen some hippopotamus
i did
i saw some when i was in a boat
and they were swimming all round me
yeah
you have to be very careful because they've got huge mouths
they could eat you all up
and they could tip you out of the boat as well
did he
yeah
i did
did he say pardon me
did he
i didn't hear him
said pardon me
pardon me tiger
what're we gonna going to have for our dinner in a minute
can you remember
you can
what did we buy from asda
oh dear
what did we buy from asda for our dinner
got writing on it
that's one thing that you're pretty good at
cutting
when i went to play to help out all the other children couldn't do it
i was most impressed
i remember when you first learnt how to cut
not that you cut anything very beautiful
but at least you've learnt how to do it
and those scissors are pretty tricky because mummy can't cut anything with them
although i think we'll have to take them with us
well
we'll take them with us so that you can do cutting
but what might we need to wrap up when we're in majorca
some presents for
i don't think there's much point wrapping them up before we go is there
so if we get there and we can buy some paper
no
majorca we're going to aren't we
and who what did mummy just tell you and it made you laugh lots
who did she tell you was gonna going to take you to the airport
john
in his taxi
yeah
you thought that was crazy didn't you
we're going in john's car to the airport
not mummy's and not daddy's
and why was there a knock on the door very early this morning
what did daniel come and tell daddy
something that you'd done
on what
yeah
and you'd left it down all night didn't you
last night you did
because mummy let you play in the car while i was sitting on the doorstep watching you
but i didn't notice that you'd wound the window down
on the other side did i
and somebody could've come and pinched beatty
couldn't they
so john's gonna going to come very very early on saturday morning
with his taxi
and we're gonna going to put your car in it
andy's car
and then mummy and daddy are going to get in
and he's gonna going to drive us to the airport
will that be fun
yeah
daddy'll sit next to john and i'll have to squeeze in the middle next to you and andy willn't i
like i did at gagi's
tell you what
we've been to tunbridge wells haven't we since
are you
that'll be lovely
what
what do you think he'll do with them
will he put them up on his wall
are you
now
what did we do in tunbridge wells
who lives there
can you remember
is that where gagi lives
what did we do that was very special there
we went to the enchanted forest didn't we
oh
and what did we see there
coaches
in the car
you mean those caravan things
those that those people lived in
with the little cooker in
what else did you do
you went in
yeah
yeah
and what were those flowers called that we liked
that's right
and what did you say to mummy which was ever so sweet
what did you say
that's what you said
you said do they ring didn't you
the bluebells
we couldn't hear them could we
they creak do they
oh
think the flowers could hear them ringing
no
then we went in that big tent
what was in that big tent
there was a fire wasn't there
was it
there there was smoke went out the top didn't it
that's right
there was a man playing his guitar wasn't there
remember him
and sing
was he singing as well or not
no
i think he played the pipes didn't he
what else did we see
we saw those little houses for all those animals didn't we
by the river
do you remember
they had little front doors
they were a bit magic weren't they
what did we think lived in those
a bit like was it a bit like tales of and brambley hedge
it was really good wasn't it
and what else did we see flying at the beginning
just when we set off
did we see an eagle
we did
yeah
yeah
i think he did
no
i do
yeah
what doesn't gagi like
she doesn't like frogs does she
although she's got lots of toy frogs in her house hasn't she
and what else did we do
oh
where did we go and play
where did you go climbing with daddy
on the
on the rocks
yeah
mummy used to climb there when she was a little girl
it's really good fun
did you
didn't didn't you get stuck
or not
i didn't want to go down
well
i was holding andy wasn't i
because i'm always frightened of getting stuck
what else did we do when we were away
oh
what happened to mummy
what we went to see that old man who's called uncle daniel
but not daniel pots
a very very old uncle daniel
and what did mummy lose
and then we they found mummy's purse didn't they
so mummy was very pleased
but then what happened
yeah
did you think the doctors did it
yes
and mummy was ever so pleased because they rang to say they'd found mummy's purse didn't they
so i went and bought a box of chocolates for them to say thank you for being so honest
and when i looked in it all my flipping money had gone
so i lose faith in humanity for a moment there
i was busy saying to your daddy ninety nine percent of people are very honest
i think you can
try again
and whose house are we going to this afternoon

but it hasn't arrived has it
we were going to give him a special tent weren't we
but they rang us and they haven't got any
we'll have to get him something else
but to do that
think he'll still like a tent to play in
oh
think that's cheating a bit isn't it
what do you think daddy'll do with all those bits

oh
do you think he'll want all those on his wall

he thought they might be lucky pajamas

side by side
because then they're the same
you've already got some side by side on look
