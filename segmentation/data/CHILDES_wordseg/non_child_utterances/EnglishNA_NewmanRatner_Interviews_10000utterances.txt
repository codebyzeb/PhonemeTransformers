sure sure
okay um
which what are the toys that
um probably the food toys
i think she's been starting to eat
she's been getting her she's starting to eat solids
oh
so she's been um probably the last month she's been eating actually not month and a half she's been eating solids but she's getting introduced to food but
it seemed like she's real interested in all the food toys
so
um she liked peas and the spaghetti
a lot
um she liked the bread
bread peas spaghetti
what else did you like
she liked the frog
and she actually was interested in the book but she wanted to eat it mostly
tried to actually read it to her she got mad so
do you have any of these books at home
uh we have mister brown
and the foot
have those two
um
and we have a book that's similar to this
with like the fur coming out of it but not this one
oh
yeah
and we have a book that's similar to this one too actually
but yeah we have a lot of books at home
yeah we have one that's very similar to this one but it's not not that one
and then we have the regular good night book
we have a lot of ones that are sim either those two we do have or ones that are similar so she's seen them
um
but she usually likes to look at books a lot um
we read a lot with our older son so um
i think she liked it that but half the time she wants to eat the books so
so i know it it's with my son it took us awhile he eventually he would like just listen to the story and not eat the books but
oh
i we realized yeah for awhile they just wanna eat so
okay
um
um
so would you say she prefers books
um
at home i'd say normally she prefers books because
i think because it involves um she's she's much more people oriented than our son was
and like my son would've been very happy to sit and play with toys for awhile
okay
and it took us a long time to actually get her to want to play with toys a lot longer than my son she kept wanting to look at people's faces
we sat her down to play with toys she just wanted to look at to look at us
so if we were reading a book i could put her on my lap and have my son over here and i'd read her a book
and she could look at the book and look at the our face
um but toys she'd sit down and just didn't
so finally
probably two months ago she started really liking getting the hang of toys
and now she finds interest once she could sit up she um liked them a lot more and she could sit with her brother
and she thought she just was the coolest thing she could sit and play with her brother so
so normally i'd say she likes probably books more than toys
um and some and when we're all when it's when i have my son and and her together she'll she'll sit and she'll listen but today she just wanted to chew on so
um
which did you
you know she probably was the least interested in the stuffed animals
but she played with this too
she liked the frog for a little bit but then she just really wanted to play with the um all the play food
so
yeah i know
you know i thought when i came out i said i thought she might like them because she liked faces a lot so i didn't know if she would like but
she was all about the food maybe she's hungry and trying to tell me
um do you think she recognizes any of the foods
um
she
the only one that she might recognize would be peas
because she's eaten peas
the other ones she's not really eaten very much of
she was i wondered if i was wondering if she'd recognize this one this is what we ate for supper last night
oh okay
so i didn't know if maybe that's why she gravitated to the spaghetti she was getting noodles we were giving her little bits of noodles last night
yeah
for supper so i don't know if it's the peas and the spaghetti are the only ones that she's eat actually no actually no she probably she liked the bread to and she's had that
the foods that she picked are the ones that she's had and then a couple things she a couple other ones but most of the ones she spent the time with the peas and the spaghetti and and that
do you have a doll
um we have a doll
um it was my son's
and she just recently has really been interested in um
the in the doll
um
so
you're kinda goofy
what do you think
there was another kid here you didn't even know it
are you sharing
you wanna hug
funny girl
yeah
you had all this food and you didn't realize there was another kid here
little baby doll
yeah
yeah we got a doll for my son when were expecting her
so to help him and we thought you know i was like well when i'm busy with her like i have to change her diaper like oh you can change the babydoll's diaper
oh yeah
so he felt that he was doing something too
oh
and um so we got it and he ended up we decided it was he ended up deciding to name it baby steve
so my husband was at first was kinda like are you giving my son a doll
oh
and then after he saw with it for awhile he was a little worried but then after awhile he kinda you know occasionally the doll would come out but it wasn't like a constant
oh
it wasn't his absolute favorite toy but it was one that he would bring along with him
okay
and um
and my husband eventually got over the the shock of his son playing with a doll
okay do you guys have any play food at home
okay
we do
we have play food we've got stuffed animals we've got books we've got all the
okay
we've got all this stuff so
um
yeah my son likes playin he was in a phase where he wanted to play kitchen and well he wanted to play in our kitchen so we got him um food and kitchen stuff and stuff for christmas
okay
he gets it out occasionally and then she likes to play with it too
so um
oh okay um i think that's it is there anything else you can think of or
um
i can't think of anything
i know i was like i can't think of any
i know with um
you know with her and t i know with our son it took awhile
i don't know it took awhile for us to get to the point where he would like play like really play with the toys like he would sit and he'd like kinda look at them a lot and that's what she seems to do too
oh
um
but um
and with
i'm trying to think of what to say um
no
that's okay
but
what do you think luc
oh i know what i was going to say on the questionnaires that i had filled out
like one of them was asking if we if i like if she understood a word or if she or and then it like if she understood and said a word
and i didn't check off very many words i'm there's not too many words that i know she really understands
okay
um she watches us for everything
right
like she really really watches us
but i haven't been able to discern if she actually knows knows
right
like i'm sure she does but i can't pick out which ones she actually knows so
um
um
you know
i think it's still pretty early we have another set as um they get older
yeah
so
later on she'll when i di i did some of these studies with my son when he was younger and i remember at a time he was at a certain point i could pick out easily you know words that he knew or words that he you know words that he could say them or not
yeah
but she's still not to the point where i can pick out what she can say what she knows
well it'll be interesting in a couple months she talks more than my son does
he he talks a lot
oh
like as of now he talks a lot when he's around like our family
um he doesn't talk very much around people he doesn't know but around us he talks a lot
and how old is he
um he'll be three next month
oh
um but she is um she's always been very she makes a lot of noise
ah
well we don't know what she says but
okay
that's all the questions we have
okay sure
oh you're welcome
okay i think we made it through most of the toys
yeah that's great
really great
um and now i just have a few questions
and i won't write down the answers
i'll just let the microphone pick it up for me
oh okay
um the first question is which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most
well he liked to manipulate this book a lot
i think he definitely likes the physical manipulation of that
and he tends to like things
usually actually one of his favorite toys is a ball
so he seems to like things that he like that he can hold in his hand like this
um i don't know
i would say he's not that real big on stuffed animals but probably the the little things that he can manipulate in his hand
that's probably a real long answer for a simple question
no perfect
um which is a good toy for his or her personality his personality
ah haha anything that is mechanical in nature and anything that he can kinda chase after
things that use his fingers and things like i said balls
ah but of the of the toys that are here
i think this bucket and this book because they're littler things that he can kinda look at and take in the crevices on them
okay great
why do you think it interests him
he just seems to have a nature that is constantly interested in ah moving things around
he himself and little objects and things like that
he loves to shake things and bang things and
okay and you already touched on which of the toys seemed to interest him the least
um i know you said stuffed animals anything else or
i don't know
some expert is probably going to watch this and say
oh that mom doesn't know her kid at all
haha not at all
um no i mean he didn't seem he likes stuffed animals usually like what i was doing with his face
that's he likes how soft they are but
uhhum
he's not i don't think he's into them for the look of them
maybe when he gets a little older
so i'd probably say the stuffed animals interest him the least
okay and why do you think that is
i think it's they're sort of inanimate
okay
which book did or would your child prefer to read aloud with you
definitely this one because he likes
if he if he's willing to sit and look at a book
and probably we didn't get to this one
but he probably would have liked this one a little bit
he likes the touch and feel and the lift the flap thing
that's that seems to be more his interest in books
okay and were there any items you think your child didn't know the name of
all of the above no
ah didn't know the name of
probably the majority of these he does not know the name of
i don't know i try very hard when we're playing to kind of tell him the names of things
but i think it's all still connecting up there
alright okay
and do you have any toys like these at home
we do
i actually don't play with toy food with him very much at home
i obviously do books with him
and he has stuffed animals that we play with
and ah yeah we my older daughter plays more with the toy food than he plays with the toy food
okay and do you think your child prefers books or toys
yeah i would say toys
okay and do you ever play with pretend food or pretend to feed dolls at home
well we'll do
i have a three year old daughter
so we'll sometimes have tea parties
and we'll do things like that
or he'll see her doing that
but i would i would not tend to sit down with him with this doll and like pretend to
also he's breast fed exclusively
so he doesn't really know that much about bottles
i mean he's taken a bottle a few times
but no it wouldn i wouldn't think to do that at this age
maybe i should
who knows
not implying anything haha
um and let's see
you got winnie
so that is that
okay
okay so which of the toys did he seem most interested in
um the it seemed like the food and the book the peekaboo book
which one would you say is best for his personality
oh um i don't know
likes sit down and read books or is he more like active he just likes
he's fairly um he's pretty active
ah he just started crawling
so now he can go towards stuff that he wants
so that's been a big change in the last couple of days
um usually he has his sister play to play with that's kind of in his face
so that's his favorite toy haha
and then why do you think
i think it's funny because we have a set of food at home that he plays with a lot
and um we have a peekaboo book at home too that's really similar to this one
so he might have recognized them
and we have a waffle too in our set so
which of the toys did he seem interested in
um the stuffed animals
ah we don't we have them at home
but he never really seems interested at home either
so maybe that's why
um and he kinda liked the clock
which we have foam shapes at home too
so i think he liked that it was the same texture as what we have
but um yeah he didn't really seem interested in the stuffed animals
which book did he
the peekaboo book
were there any items knows the name for
i don't think so
not yet
um and you said you do have books similar
yeah yeah
and if you had to chose between books and would you chose books
probably the food
it's a better texture for him to eat haha
haha does he play with any dolls at home sister's
um he doesn't really seem into them
she kind of hoards them
we'll leave we'll leave that open and see yeah
sure okay sure
closer to the time we'll call you
okay good alright
do you like that one
we should get a clock
we should get a clock for you guys at home
okay i think we can i mean she can continue to play
um i we were just gonna ask you a couple questions
about the play session
um which toys do you think she enjoyed the most
uh she liked the bumble bee
yeah what do you think she liked about that
um i don't know i guess the silly
and you know i made the noises for it and the tickling
and she really liked this book we have one at home
you do it does it is it the same title
um yes but it's um it's a cloth one
it has like a little different but um of all the colors and stuff she likes bottles and stuff she has that stuff at home
any stuff she's familiar with
were there other things that she was familiar with that you played with
um she has a baby doll at home
uh it's not really the same but uh
yeah baby doll
and um some stuffed animals and stuff and keys
we might have some keys
i don't know i don't remember
i noticed you were playing with a puppet
yeah i don't i don't have a puppet at home
no do you think she identified with the animal
more than like a with a or do you think she doesn't know that
um she doesn't know what a kangaroo is no i don't think unless my mom has told her or something but
i don't know that she knows what a kangaroo is i'm gonna take her to the zoo like in may but
um pro knows it's like an animal it's soft
you know when i first showed her her baby doll like she just started like laughing like it her baby doll looks like her
so i think she recognized that it was like a doll type thing
and with animals i think she recognizes those so like
oh no sorry you might wanna clean those toys
oh yeah did you see any did there seem to be any toys that she was not interested or least well what do you think she was least interested in
um like i guess i tried to show her this book a little bit and she kinda seemed like she pushed it away and she wanted to look at this one
i think she reached out for it at one point
and like i i took away the bottle at one point and i think she was looking for it like i put it right here
and i dunno she likes stuff that goes in her mouth she's teething she has one tooth
so do you think she prefers books or toys over
um my mom reads to her a lot um i'm not sure i try to do an equal balance of both
maybe toys things that can go in her mouth and stuff like that
well she seemed to be pretty good with the book sitting through it you know so at the
yeah that was fun and she'd like hold it and turn the pages and stuff
yeah that was nice
um does she was she playing similarly here as she would at home with the types of toys that she was playing with
yeah yeah i mean um yeah i guess so um at home it's like there's more like cars and stuff like that in the basement
and then upstairs more like just like stuffed animals and different things so it's like we don't have like them all laid out it's you know anywhere in the house there are different kinds of toys but um
does she play with dolls
yeah
okay i just heard the cars and things so i was just wondering
yeah she she does have a doll at home
okay okay so um do you think there are any toys here that she would recognize the name of
um the dog
like she might know dog
because especially when i make the noise and like uh um like bird or something like that you know you make the noise
and there's nothing here that's completely new or she wouldn't know the name of
yeah maybe the kangaroo
and if i had presented like the zebra or something she didn't really know that
you know where the doggy is woof woof
woof woof
well great
good job little will
i'm going to ask you some questions about the play session
and i'm not gonna write anything down because we have the audio
so um
what toys do you think seemed to ah interest the most
um probably the spoon
i think he loved to chew on it and hold it and
um you know anything he likes i mean that's that's something very s something that very familiar with
and something that's fun to hold and to chew on and
these he plays with these at home
um somewhat and
um probably just things that are just squishy that are he l that are nice things to hold in his hand
and texture feels fun he likes to chew on them he's teething
uhhum
um i think the baby is was he definitely had interest in the baby because he likes faces and um
his little br my mother gave his big brother a baby doll that um he doesn't really play with
but um around the house
and so i think he just likes faces so that's definitely of interest
um ah in contrast which ah which of the toys did you see sorry which of the toys interested him the least
well this this thing i think didn't the texture didn't feel good on his his face when i was kind of playing with it so
he made made a really disgusted face
um um i don't know i think anything he likes things that make noise and things that are um
movement so if you know the tower he likes the towers and
um the book didn't seem to interest him at all
particularly
do you think um any of those books you know in a um a day obviously when you weren't aren't here any of those books would interest him or
um i would say like books with faces babies he likes to look at that
um he certainly is read a lot to
but more because i'm reading to his older son before bed
and he's sitting on my lap too
and um so um maybe he has the second child syndrome
j t little wills don't don't sit chew on this
um that he um doesn't get read t doesn't get as much personal attention as his older brother i think
k so in t me re picking out like age appropriate books it just doesn't happen as much
we read good night moon a lot
this is not good night moon i know but
um so i don't know
are there any toys that are similar
i know you said you have the kind of a baby doll at home
are there any toys at home that are here or any toys here that are similar to ones that you have at home
um well he has a sippy um
he's familiar with that
he ah we don't have any play food or anything like that
but i mean in terms of the shape like i mean we have um
he has blocks
his brother is playing with legos the duplos a lot
i don't know if the shapes are not really similar
keys we have a set of keys
he has a set of toys keys he does
um right you have some some keys that look a little bit like this
so um i know you said that you don't have much um toy food at home is there anything anything besides the sippy that you think he would have recognized
he would certainly recognize all of these as toys
things that he could would be fair game anyway
but um we have we have little beaniebabies
but he doesn't take much interest in them
he doesn't touch them or stroke them or pick up
i mean he he's chewed on th picked up and chewed on before
um and at this point do you think that there um are any names any names of these toys now that he would recognize like if you you know it seems like you know baby you know that kind of a familiar thing are there
spoon for sure
um probably um cup
um plate for sure
book for sure
probably about it
i mean toast
i didn't play with this
what's the matter wills
what's the matter
um maybe some of the animals maybe he would rec like
i mean um horse or teddy or something like that maybe
but that's about it probably
okay alright well great thank you so much and we can go and get the mic from you
haha um so just in terms of the things that he did play with here what do you think interested him the most
um
it's ha it's hard to tell because he seemed to
it's hard to tell
i think anything he can put in his mouth really
that's really what he cares about
um and he definitely seemed to you know once he saw this he recognized it each time it showed up so
um
he seemed to like that
he likes bright things
you know so he was going towards the bright animals
okay
but i don't i don't know that he had a favorite
i think it'd be easy to substitute
ahhah so you think maybe the things that he could put in his mouth
the animals he didn't so much put in his mouth
but the things that he could hold
i mean but he liked this a lot
i took this away i guess
look at that
oh maybe not
he didn't really put it in his mouth right
no okay
i wonder why well i don't know
i actually wasn't watching you too much
he put it in his mouth a little bit
so do you think that's why he liked it too or the color
or what do you think
well just based on the other things he likes he definitely likes the bright colors
um and able to put it in his mouth
so it had two features huh
haha two reasons to love that one
yeah i see that you do
but then if i give him this again he might just take this again
ah do you have toys like any of these things at home
um i ha nothing like this box at all
um we have lots of stuff stuffed animals um rattles things that you pull and they vibrate stuff like that
so i have a basket that's about this size
and what i'll do is sit him on the floor and put the basket in front of him
and he'll just pull stuff out and put it back in
but i don't play with him
i let him do that
um but if i play with him normally what i would do is i do pattycake and this little piggy
and i'll tickle him and
blow on his belly
that's the stuff what we do a lot more of
right not so much toys per se
not so much toys
but more more stuff like that
or reading or something like that
did you um i didn't see did you take a look at any of those books that we have
i pulled the foot book out for a moment
and started it
but he didn't have any interest
haha
is that something you have at home that one
no i have the good night moon at home
but we have a couple doctor seuss in you know this size
yeah
cool um do you think he prefers books or toys or
toys to definitely to books yeah
i try and introduce books a lot
and he doesn't seem to like as much as i do haha
maybe by next time
you never know how things will change
um i think you already said he doesn't play with pretend food and
no we don't have anything like this
um the most he'll do is when i put him in his highchair i give him plastic bowls and cups
and so he plays with those
he bashes and throws 
haha
haha he throws them
do you do that
throws them and likes to make noise
yeah definitely
i heard you make a noise
i heard you make a noise
it's fun isn't it
yeah yeah you can't do a lot with your voice
do you have any dolls baby dolls or anything dolllike besides the stuffed animal type toys
no
it's like teddy bear and a monkey things like that
you have a monkey
that's his favorite
really
that's his favorite
it's green and blue
and it has these hooks on the end on each of its limbs
and so it hooks onto everything
and he'll just play with that forever
you mean you can put it onto like a chair
uhhum it's like a sea thing
i have never seen that
does it have like a
is it a plastic hook
so it's it's a furry animal and then just its appendages are
so you can hang it
yeah
so it looks like it's hanging from a tree or something
uhhum it's real cute
he likes that a lot
what do ya got there
cheese
um let's see
i'm not sure this applies at this particular age
but were there any items that you think he didn't really know the name of
um well probably he probably doesn't know the name of a lot of them
that's what i would sort of think
you know um
he doesn't
i mean i don't think yeah
i don't think he knows the name of a lot of the stuff
pertain more to the kids as they get older
i thought i'd ask let's see
and you said that he likes things that are bright colors and likes things that he can put in his mouth
uhhum haha that's usually what ends up with the books
so that's why he we don't do books as much because he just puts in his mouth
and they're made out of paper
haha
um is there oopsies
did you go down
do you wanna get up
there you go
oops there you go
um was there anything about how he likes to play that you've seen at home or here that you'd um
there you are
that i didn't ask that would be good to know
um
what he likes how he plays that kind of stuff
i would i mean i think the biggest thing is if he's ever by himself it's definitely he likes different things
he'll get bored
and he'll go onto the next thing and go back again
um ah i think that's
does he like playing by himself
he like yeah i mean i work part and um some of the days from home
and my babysitter didn't come on wednesday
so i had him for the day while i was working
and i put him on the floor with a blanket
and he just played for a good hour
actually which was which i was impressed with haha
yeah
but he really is more of a
actually i let me modify that
he does play with himself
but he would prefer to interact with people by far
haha
but he's not gonna fuss every time he's by himself
no yeah yeah
wow that's pretty good alexander
that's pretty good
okay well i think
unless there's anything that you thought of that i didn't ask about what he likes
we'll um revisit it when you come back again
okay and i guess that's all i have to do i can turn this off
i have a little follow up um questions questions
i can play with caroline
okay
while you're jodi can
oh sure can i is it okay if i let her out of here
can come out
come with me caroline
mommy's gonna going to answer some questions
ask you some questions
okay
gonna be writing anything down we're gonna use the tape
okay
transcription
okay
so which of the toys seem to interest caroline the most
um i think the um cookie that she ate
and maybe this towards the end and the kangaroo on only if i was working it
okay and which do you think is a good toy for her personality
um
maybe the bumble bee
she likes things with faces and then she also likes things too that are like tactile
okay
so which of the toys seem to interest caroline the least
the books
the books
and why do you think that
i think it's uh my older daughter was like this too and like for a certain period of a couple months
she's just too um antsy to to sit and look at a book
like if if you could be mobile and use a book she she would be better off i think
okay so one of the questions is do you think she prefers books or toys
toys definitely
okay
yeah
if you had to pick a book which book did she prefer to look at with you
uh of the ones here
um
oh honey
the book that we were looking at before you guys came in she liked a lot
it was like a pop up and a tactile one
but then this tactile one i think i think her being in the in the seat
made it hard for her to sit
do you want me to take her
what happened
what happened
that was a close one
i do have a binky with me but i don't know where i p
oh no it's in here
alright you
um and i'm also guilty of not reading too many books with her lately
uhhum
um because i because it's hard
she squirms out of my lap and stuff
so
okay
i'm not sure if that was what you were questioning me about or not
um do you have any toys like these at home
um yeah we have a lot of soft toys
um we don't have any puppets
i might try puppets
and her older sister plays with all the play food and stuff which she of course doesn't you know do pretend play
but she mouths a lot
and we do have books all over
but she's not interested in books at home like on her own either
does she ever play with dolls at home
um she climbs on them haha
okay
but no not yet
not in any meaningful manner
that's about it
okay
thank you very much
you're welcome
for coming
ugh
that's good
and um i'm just gonna ask you a few questions
and um
i'm not gonna write any of this down
it's all being recorded but it's just
i have questions about the toys that you were playing with
so um
which of the toys seem to do you think seem to interest katarina the most
um
the i guess familiar like the dog the bee the frog
um and then i guess the baby
and the spoon maybe
um which do you do you think um any of these in particular are good for her personality or
well she loves puppies
so
that one i think and then i mean she has a baby at home but we don't play with it much
so i mean but she at she likes the faces and stuff so
i think that probably was
the good the good one haha
in uh which of the which of the toys um that you played with do you think that she had the least interest in
um
i guess
well today some of the books which
i dunno she didn't seem to be too into the books and then the foods
just she's not i mean we don't have anything like that we have spoons like she eats with but we don't have toy foods at home so
she probably wasn't as familiar with those
yeah um
and then which um
which which book do you think uh interested her the most
i think the peekababy one she liked the most today
um
er
do you think there's any that uh she specifically re uh recognized the the name of like at home if you're
um
baby
puppy
and and uh ball
for sure i think
uh okay and uh
ball
were there any of the items that you think were maybe new to her that she didn't recognize either the toy or the name of the toy
um
well i mean any of the food items
probably
and then
i mean of course i think i probably tended to gravitate towards ones that she knew more
um
i mean kangaroo she wouldn't have
known
the name of
do you have um
cause as i noticed that you were playing with the stuffed animals a lot did you do you um have any kinda of those stuffed animals toys at home
we don't have any of these exact ones she does have
stuffed animals but we actually i mean we don't
play with the stuffed animals so much as like
usually like
i give them to her like in the car seat or whatever
um i guess we play with her maybe her stuffed puppy a little bit
but
yeah
alright
and um and then which
uh
which books um or toys at home does does she play with
she she really likes this one at home
um
and at home she has a lot of musical instruments so she likes those and then she has balls she really likes balls to so
okay and um
i know that you said you don't you don't really have much of the pretend uh food and everything at home but out of those ones you think it was it was pretty much you know the spoon and maybe like a little cup
yeah she and she yeah i mean the things she actually has like a cup and spoon
probably are the ones she recognized i mean she seemed to enjoy the peas which she hasn't actually seen peas like that
you know per see but
no i mean i guess she's mostly still a baby but at this point so she's not eating much of that um
does uh and you said you do have a baby at home
well she has a baby doll but i mean she doesn't play with it that much
i mean
she um she has um little tiny mini baby dolls but like she has one
similar to this but
yeah
we don't play with it if she sees it its in her room and like she's like talked to it before but
oh okay
she doesn't she doesn't like i don't i guess bring it out to play with yet because i just feel like its so big for her haha maybe i will cause she likes it but haha
yeah cause you you were right when you first brought it out its almost as big as her
yeah haha
well thank you very much for that information
and
can you say bye bye to the baby
giovanna can play with him a little bit
so do you think there were particular toys that he liked more
he liked the bee
why do you think that is
um he likes soft things on his face especially
and i think this really interesting texture was interesting to him
i know if i put my hair on his face he loves it
of course then he grabs it
but he loves it
maybe not quite such a good thing to do here
but no he likes he likes soft textures
and he likes kind of funky textures so
yeah i noticed you tended to go toward the stuffed animals
and so did he not like say the food items
yeah
do you play with any food items at home or
uh no we're mostly soft stuff still
um he'll grab something especially if it's got an edge and just do it real quickly
so i don't want him to
it's more of a safety
safety thing yeah
going with the soft stuff
yup
um were there any one toys that you thought he particularly didn't like
no we didn't try very many of them
i just picked to what we generally play with at home so
but i don't think there was anything he disliked
are there particular ones of these that you actually do have yourself
uh i don't see anything familiar
i mean we have stuffed toys but
but not those particular toys
and we have a book like this but
does he generally prefer books or toys
or does he play a bunch with books
um he plays with books
and daddy reads to him every night
but he just kind of sits there
like he doesn't really play with them
we've got mostly feely type ones and pop books and stuff like that
but he he prefers toys and um things that dangle
um what about dolls
do you have any
no we don't have any
um i think there's one in daycare
one of the girls at daycare have one
but we don't have
and that's not something that's ever interested him
some kids really get into babies
yeah no not not yet
it seemed like he was struggling to get to things
well that's something we do at home too is we put things kind of far away
so he has to work to get to them
um we're working on moving and you know locating and crawling and stuff like that and direction driven driven
you know if he wants it he has to go get it
so if we're home we actually if he wants his pacifier we'll put it just out of his reach
and we'll make him you know kind of crawl to get for get to it
and sometimes he decides he doesn't want it and goes off to another
which is fine too because we're not he likes his pacifier
we you know we don't care either way
i don't want a two year old with a pacifier so haha
but mostly just getting him to
to move and to yeah
and to to put the
if i go get something
and then it's over there then it's over here
then he can go get it
are there particular books
you said that your husband read to him every night
are there like favorites in the family
um doctor seuss
he like um hop on pop and fox in socks and a couple of those
i think daddy prefers those more than he does but haha
i think my husbands favorite book is still fox in socks so
you seem to be getting into that now huh
okay
you seem to be getting into that now huh
haha you gonna start crawling
yeah he gets up
then he goes down
but he does the army crawl
check it out and see how
pizza
pizza
yummy yummy
there's cheese
that's good and then what we're gonna do is come sit here
and i'm going to ask you a couple questions
great
sorry i tried to keep the ones he uh
alright
okay so which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most
um tags
tags okay
um which is a good toy for his or her for his his personality
ah he really likes to chew stuff
so stuff that has like little things sticking out he likes to like eat it
okay why do you think he's interested in those
um just from experience that's what he likes to do
okay which of the toys seemed to interest your child the least
um books although at home he likes books
okay why do you think maybe these books
i think that there's just other other interesting stuff
okay which book did your child prefer to look at or read with you
ah none
okay what about at home
um he loves we have an animal book at home he loves
um we have a teletubby book at home he loves
whatever i sit and read to him he loves
ah were there any items you think your child didn't know the name of
well like a lot of those animals he didn't know the name of a lot of animals
a lot of your food i mean he can make up his own
well he doesn't talk
what about understanding
ah i mean he doesn't really know what ice cream is
meat cheese but we can pretend
or like peanut butter
but i pretended it's baby food
that works just as good right
right
he doesn't drink a bottle but
i'm sure he could figure out what to do with it
okay right we just have the juice and he
the cup he does drink from a cup
but he doesn't drink from a bottle period
so um but i'm sure he could figure it out if ah
look see he puts it right in his mouth
um and you already answered this do you think he prefers books or toys
um toys here
um do you ever play with pretend food or pretend to feed dolls at home
and what do you do if you
um no with him i have not
um so he doesn't play with dolls at all at home
well he has a two year old sister who's playing with dolls all day
so like she'll like line him up with the dolls and feed all the dolls and pretend to feed him
like i guess he kind of plays with dolls but
he's n he doesn't really play with dolls on his own
and that is all we have for you
besides like suck their fingers and stuff like that
or if they have tags then he really likes them
okay it's been fifteen minutes
so that part is done
how did the toys taste
good
so then we just have a few follow up questions
i'm not going to write down the answers because i'll just let the microphone pick it up
um the first question is which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most
uh the plastic food
related i mean you know this bin
okay
and which is a good toy for his personality
um that is a weird question
yeah some of these are kind of not questions
i i mean i thought that you know the these block things were good he i he likes to knock things over and pick them up and eat them and then knock them over
so the that that worked that worked well
he usually is much more mobile
um but i guess everything was so fascinating you know
and kind of right up in his
which of the toys seemed to interest your child the least
um i would say the books and the other baby
okay
why do you think that is
um i i think maybe he he often he might associate books with going to sleep
um and i don't know why he's not interested in the other baby
i mean he's an only child
uh we don't see a lot of other babies
so maybe he doesn't really realize what it's supposed to be
i don't know
either that or he's a sociopath
i have no idea
which i hope that's not the right answer
because he did kind of bite the baby on the head so i'm not sure
well he's also biting so
we'll call it a kiss
a love bite
that's right
um if he did like books which do you think he would prefer to read or look at with you
um let's see
i think that he um probably this peekaboo book
okay
just because it is a little bit more interactive
but um when we when we read books he generally does try to eat them still
um the only one he really doesn't eat too much is good night moon
but that's because we read it to him right before we put him to bed
so i mean he definitely would have thought that was bedtime
and not been happy about it
were there any items you think your child didn't know the name of
oh pretty much everything
yeah we're not he's very physically advanced
we're not so sure how smart he is
good thing he's got good hair
thank goodness that's what my mom used to say
thank goodness you
do you have any toys like these at home
um no not really
we have blocks you know traditional blocks
um i do let him play with a lot of the kitchen plastic kitchen utensils
no knives
just for the record
no sweetie
that's not a toy
i know
doesn't that look like something fun to put in your mouth
it's not
trust us
oh you're so silly
um so um not really
we don't really have
he's got things that
he's got a little drum a little wooden drum that makes noise that rolls
but i would say we don't really have anything like this at home
except for the kitchen stuff
okay
um i think we already answered this but do you think your child prefers books or toys
toys
okay
do you ever play with pretend you have pretend food
do you ever pretend to feed dolls at home and what do you do
no
we do not
and i think you already answered this
he doesn't he does not play with any dolls right
uh he has um uh he has a couple like these kinds of stuffed animal style but not like baby dolls
he doesn't have a baby doll
mostly did you see how he greeted the kangaroo
no what did he do
um he hugged it
he went really he got all excited and when and then put it in his mouth
we have a we have a kangaroo uh puppet hand puppet at home that has a little joey in the pouch too
so he
look it's rooroo
hi jojo
so that was kind of a familiar he didn't react that way to the other stuffed animals
and somebody's getting tired
are you
snuggle
do you want to get that thing over there for me please
can you go get it
look can you go get that
you sure
okay
but i do want to talk to you a few minutes about it
sure sure
you wanna come out for that
yeah
she's
okay okay you're out
don't worry
i think
there we go okay
okay hold on
there there you're okay
oh isabel
oh my goodness
oh
there shh shh
wanna crawl around
oh you're okay
there
there
there
okay
there
that was a pretty quick turn around
yeah
get a distraction in there
so um are any of these toys ones that you actually have at home
that she's particulary familiar with already or
um the food
um you want in particular
in general
uh like the peas
we have these the same exact peas at home
um some of the plates
i dunno if she'll go after those
um
i take it they're for her sister
the spoons yeah
she has an older sister
and then she has some stuffed animals
although she has lots of stuffed animals
i don't think she's ever played with a baby doll before
and then you know we read her books
but nothing
isabel not in your mouth
but not um
we clean them after each baby so
okay well not too bad then
um i don't think we have these exact books
but um
you commented that good night moon was the new one so i was thinking
oh yeah the numbers
yeah
i haven't seen the number good night moon before
we have the original
most people have
yeah
does she actually play with the food items
or is it mostly just that her sister does and they're in the house
no she'll play with them
but she just kind of handles them
and looks at them and
goes on to the next
are there particular toys that you think match her personality better
that she tends to go for or tends to be more interested in as a general class
um ones that light up and play music
seem to be those seem to get her attention the most
or anything she can put in her mouth
that's pretty typical
but yeah
why did you pick the particular stuffed animals that you did out of all of them
cause you di yo you were choosing among them
yeah um the brighter colored ones
i just thought they would you know especially with the hair
here with the different material
that would get her attention a little more
but definitely the brighter colors
something to kind of attract her attention
but you picked the chicken
the chicken
yeah well then i started going with the animal sounds
thinking that she might enjoy or
it's harder to really teach her anything at this point but
you know
get started early with the animal sounds
are there particular games you tend to play with her
peekaboo
this is one of 
um that's pretty much i think that's the only game i can think of that we play with her
and we tickle her
um but yeah i think probably peekaboo is the only that she can really identify with
just a second
okay
uh which of these do you think she liked the least of all the things you played with
uh the stuffed animals
or no the clock actually
she didn't have any interest in the clock
you mentioned frio is frio a
oh yeah it's my parent's poodle
she sees frio prob a few times a week
but it's a black poodle
does it have the the french
yeah yes yes
but i don i she probably couldn't identify with that
probably not
um in general does she tend to prefer books or toys
toys
i'd say toys for sure
i mean with books she'll just eat she wants to put them in her mouth
so
and what's is there a favorite book that you actually tend to read her a lot of the ones at home
or is it just whatever
no it's prob whatever we're reading to her sister
is what she's gonna to be listening to
so they're probably um right a right along this line
maybe a little more advanced
yeah if only that was real
yes if only
um anything in particular that you think i should be asking and i'm not
about what things she likes and what things she doesn't
uh
or anything else you can tell me
about like playing habits
yes just playing habits
uh
i think you know having an older sister really gears her
you know her sister gears her more towards what they're going to be playing with
you know she'll pick up isabel and put her in front of the kitchen
or put her in front of her stuffed animals
and just start showing her things
so i think that's um that's probably that prob gears her more um for her playing habits
and i don't know we ha we haven't done i mean this is this is pretty typical just like kinda putting her in front of a bunch of toys and kinda letting her have at it
um yeah and everything goes in her mouth
at this age that is very difficult
everything goes in
um she has a piano at home
like a little kid little baby piano that she loves to bang on
um and then her seems the other toys that she likes are the bouncy seat
she can jump up and down in that
and yeah anything that lights up and plays music
and she also likes to stand
um like we have a little play table
that she can
that she can stand on
or stand and hold on to yeah
to keep her balance
she really likes to do that
but um yeah she doesn't there's nothing else
other than that
that's pretty much all of her her playing habits
okay
well that's all i have for you
okay
when she gets a little older we're going to come back and do this again
right
at which point one of the questions will be things like what has changed
okay
like if she suddenly got some more interests or if she started liking different toys
right
yeah
yeah hopefully
but at some point she'll be moving around a little more
there's not necessarily any right answer like some kids tend to be more into st like some kids are just really into stuffed animals
yeah
yeah
and some kids are like well all i care about is things i can put in my mouth and some kids are
right
yes
yeah
yep
so here's
let me take that from you
here you go
part and
if you just leave your microphone on and i can ask you some questions
okay
that way i won't have to write anything down
perfect
um and you'll just a second
continue to eat his plate
hopefully he'll just play and be happy while we talk for a minute
um so which of the toys or kinds of toys did you think interested him the most
anything he can stuff in his mouth right now
and so what were those things
did he i wasn't wasn't watching him
he had this in this in the mystery meat the keys
um he tries to eat books a lot at home he didn't try that as much here
did you read a book this time or looked at a book
we looked at a book yeah
we did goodnight moon which we read at home constantly
there's the front
yeah although this is the counting book so
o
it's different then
i actually haven't seen that one
i haven't either that's why i wanted to read it
i was like oh this is for me
o okay
um so yeah it was the one we usually have but we also have the mr brown book but we don't read that as much at home
but he's not as interested in books as noah was at this age
cause she would turn the pages like she knew exactly what was coming next like she had certain books
he has a couple of books at home that he really likes consistently and the other ones he gets real wiggly in
he's ready to go
i mean
he likes over things
yeah
so when anna and i are reading he's always th but not necessarily attending to the book
okay so
so
you would say that um at this age he likes toys better than books
yes
okay
yeah he does
okay and um you said he likes the things he puts in his mouth
are there certain are there any of the toys that um that you think are good for his personality
like you said your daughter was more into books and he's not is is
um
there anything um here or even at home that you think
he has a couple of truck things that he thinks are really cool
like he'll roll all over the house and he does consecutive rolls to get to certain trucks
is that how he gets there
yeah he's and he's starting to do that um he pivots nicely on his belly
so he'll pivot and roll and he's starting to do a sorta backwards combat crawl which is usually you know emerges backward before
it goes anywhere forward
yeah so we keep finding him jammed under furniture
whoops
but yeah there are a couple of trucks that he tries very hard to get
okay
yeah
yeah
yeah
which of the things here did you think interested him the least
um he's not real big into stuffed animals although he thought the frog was pretty funny
so that's what he was giggling about was the frog for some reason
but he's usually not real big on stuffed animals
do you think he recognizes like the the fact that it is a frog
do you do frog stories or frog ribbits things
um no more than any other critters in our house
i mean we've got stuffed animals out of our ears
you do
and books yeah
i mean we probably read with anna a lot i mean probably an hour a day and he's usually around
but i don't think he particularly knows
okay
this is this and this is that
or animal sounds that go but he thought it was funny when you were doing that
i think he thought the jumping was funny i don't think he necessarily identified it as a frog
so i think the action to him
is more funny than the critter itself
so
so you showed him the frog
and we did the otter sea otter with eating and he didn't think that
no
that was at all entertaining
o
i didn't try the baby with him but
i don't know he's never permitted the baby at home it's annas
oh i see
um so you said you did the goodnight moon is that right
um alright and which one of those do you think he would prefer to look at with you something familar or
i don't know he's also we got a couple of these caring cats books that are peek baby books
and he seems to some days he really likes them some days he really doesn't i don't know
i don't know we didn't get to this one
peek a boo
we have a couple of peek a boo books from the library that he thinks he'll get the giggles for one of them too
do you play peek a boo with him
yes all the time and some days he thinks it's hilarious and some days he doesn't care
oh i see
so
i see
it depends on what he feels like doing
just mood
yes exactly
i mean there's this one book that consistently he was just getting the giggles like just
cracking him up and then three days later he was just over it
did you tell her that huh
yes so
you funny
i know he's a goof
um do you so you you have you said you have stuffed animals
um any other toys that are similar to what we have here
we don't have any f toys like this we have a lot of um like rattles and teethable things you know baby rattles that are
out for him little link chains and rattles that go on the ends of the linked chains and that kinda thing and he'll play with those
okay so this kinda stuff the food the plates and stuff that's new to him
we have plates
we don't have food which is interesting so
so can
we have plates and cups and he actually he has he has been doing that
anna has a little set with cups with little handles like little tea cups and tea saucers that are plastic similar to this size
and he's been into those lately and there's a water like a teapot that we use as a watering can that he's been trying to nab from her
sorta like
similar
yeah
but long spout so he gets the spout in his mouth
it's good to
oh i see
chew on
he really went for the um
the plate
plate this time
lets see
but i don't know that's cause it's a familiar object or because it fits nicely and it's easy to hold
right easy to hold right
cause it's light
it's hard to know
it's it's interesting in this study to see sometimes there's a big change even between the seven month visit and the ten month
there's a huge developmental leap
yeah and sometimes even four weeks
yeah
sometimes people we have
oh buddy
a ten a ten months sorta around visit and
a eleven month and sometimes there's changes in two weeks if someone sees them two weeks later so
yeah it's amazing what they learn and how fast
yeah
um so so i suppose he's a little young to do pretend play feeding with dolls that's the question that probably
probably better for a
little bigger
yeah
and um does he is he interested in dolls at home
do you have some
um in so much as he can chew on them
okay
not really as a an item in itself i mean it doesn't he doesn't seem to recognize
the face or anything like that
yeah he doesn't get excited like that like he does with himself in the mirror
you know it does have
right
that same level of woohoo
right
involved
okay
it may happen part of it is that everytime he touches a doll anna whacks him so he might have been
negative association
trained nicely to stay away from dolls
he'll learn to be pretty tolerant though
that's what i've found
yeah
little ones tolerate a lot that's just
you have to right
we just hope you get bigger than her and pound her back some day
that's right
you gotta make sure they can't do that too
paybacks buddy
um so you would oh i already asked you that he would prefer toys at this age
if if he was on your lap would he wanna be read to or turn or would he want to turn the pages himself
he wants to turn the pages himself
okay
yeah
o i think that's about it unless you have anything that you think is um noteworthy that i didn't ask you about his interest in toys and stuff at this age
um i don't know we have a dog and a cat he's very interested in them
they're good toys
and the dog follows him around constantly because he always has food in him he's a puky little dude so the dog follows him and licks puke off of him day in and day out so he's very
we have one of those too
interested in the dog
yes i mean it's good to have a dog
so totally disgusting but
too bad we couldn't have a dog in here for you too bad
i know we could of brought taloula in
that would be fun too
he just he loves his sister he loves daddy you know his familar people he just lights up like a christmas tree when he sees them
we didn't have either
no sorry
no we didn't sorry just toys
just stuff
well i think um that's about it
okay
then
cool
and i will just
lets extricate you
and then extricate you
he loves feet
loves feet
loves shoes
you actually can keep that on
i just have a few questions for you
oh sure
you don't wanna eat my shoe
yes he does
yummy
okay
gonna give you some
wanna hold the pizza
can you hold that
good boy
i just have a few questions for you
sure
um so which of the toys um was he most interested in would you say
the fake pizza
why why do you think that
his sister have a lot of ah fake food at home
she has a little kitchen set
and the food is in a bin on the floor
and he's able to crawl to crawl to it and knock the bin over
and get the food out of it
so he plays with the similar stuff at home
okay um which of the toys seemed to interest him the least
the stuffed animals
animals
yeah doesn't really care for them
no
okay
just no interest
they don't do anything
they don't taste all that good
okay would you say he prefers books over toys
or toys over books
he prefers toys over books
okay and if you had to pick a toy that you would say is good for his personality what would you pick and why
um for his personality
like in general or what you have here
from what we have here
um i guess the pizza he likes it so much
he's in a stage where he's
well obviously sticking everything in his mouth
and it's squishy
and it's the right size for his hands
and it's colorful
okay
and i guess the plastic doesn't taste bad
do you think he recognizes the names for any of these items
um he might
he might recognize baby he has there's a baby doll at home we play with
and um
what about the food
food
i don't know
i don't think he knows the specific names
but i try and as he's interacting with things tell him what things are
okay and let's see what else we have
do you have any of these exact same toys at home or books or any
um we ha the fake pasta looks like stuff we have at home
and the ice cone and the peas
probably got them out of the same type of set
we have mister brown can moo
but i don't know if i've ever read it to him
okay
um and we don't have any of the stuffed animals
okay and then i guess you said he was recognizing
yeah he h well he's got a bottle
so he was picking it up and kind of trying to suck on it the same way he does with his bottle
and we have you know we have fake plates
okay
we have s fake pizza
but it's not li it's harder plastic
okay i think that's all we have for you today
actually
that's a pretty interesting carpet isn't it
uhoh
hey look
doing the obstacle course now
you're a happy girl though
such a great job
yeah
so donna what do you think um interested her the most in terms of what we have here um types of toys
oh
the amount of toys
she seemed to like these a lot
just the shaking and
think it was
just making sounds and stuff
i think i think it's
are there any that you see that you think are good in particular for her type of personality the kind of kid that she is at this point
um
i think she likes she likes things that she can manipulate a lot so that's why i didn't really go for these i didn't think that she'd be into
you know something to just look at and hold
um although i think she liked feeling the textures a little bit
i see
but uh
but do you think
but she she seems to be more interested in things that she can kind of manipulate
and ac actually at home she just likes to play with like pieces of paper and crumple them up and
um i know she likes to put things in her mouth a lot too but she yeah
she likes things that she can kind of do something with
uhhum
at your belly
so the toys that she could make a sound with do you feel like those were that type of a thing and she probably likes that for that reason
yeah
i think she she seemed to be more interested in that
does she
she likes things that she can shake and
i was gonna going to say does she have any toys like that at home
yeah
yeah
yeah we've got little teethers and things
i think i left the one in the car that i that i brought with us but it's like uh um a teether and it's got little rings on it
and um so she can kind of shake them and she can feel them and move move around
the rings around and stuff
yeah
she likes that
i think i know what you're talking about there's
yeah
they're making some really good things for babies these days
yeah this one's like a a butterfly and the wings are kinda crinkly
oh so they make a crackly sound
yeah
oh okay
yeah
she likes that
she likes that
um did she see a book that she liked in particular in the book bin did you think
um she didn't really seem to go for one in particular
i mean she i think she looked at that one with the ducks on the cover maybe
a little bit
a second or two longer so that's why i pulled that one out for her
but
does she have a favorite book or books at home that you have that she like she likes to look at with you
um
not really
i have you know it's really sad i have so little time to spend alone with her uh i have two two and a half year olds and uh
that's understandable
that is
i was just wondering if she's attached sometimes
she also still it seems like she likes um some of the cloth books we have that have also again squeakers and crinkly things and things that make noise
oops
around the side perhaps
i'm not writing anything down donna we're getting it on there so i don't have to write
just attach it over here
okay
that's right
yeah
oops
oh oh
you wanna check everything out
um so i was gonna going to say it sounds like she
you wanna want to check it all out
prefers toys over books would you say that's
yeah
true
um at this point yeah
i
see if she'll look at the
i don't know that i've spent enough time reading to her that she's maybe hasn't been exposed to books that much
maybe uh one of the subsequent visits that will be more clear
yeah
you know we'll see how she changes over time
um
yeah
do you
it's also funny for me i i know um usually when i play with her i'm holding her like this
right
so it's kinda funny for me to to have her in front of me and
exactly
it was a little bit unnatural for me but um
i see okay that's interesting to know
so if you did play with her she'd be more like this
a lot of times yeah i spend sitting with her like this
yeah
and uh she often doesn't just doesn't like being put down
so yeah i think
she likes
she's just in a in a really good mood right now and she's you know
she sure is
so she did fine with that
she's feelin pretty secure
yeah at home a lot of time she cries if she's put down on the floor maybe she thinks i'm gonna going to go run off and do something else
she likes to be close to you
yeah she does
um this is she might be too young i mean we're just wondering if if she's interested in pretend food at all or um those kinds of things or dolls anything like that at home
uh
i mean you already told me that she really likes things she can manipulate so
she can
yeah
yeah
kinda like this
she can play with but she has a little um like uh it's a humpty dumpty just like a little soft toy
it's got a hole in the middle of it so she can kind of hold on to it and she seems to like that but yeah mostly she likes
you like action huh
she likes action
you like to shake and make noise and see what will happen if you do this to that
is that what it's about right now ellie
that sounds about right doesn't it
she's got something it's like a soft block and then um i think it's got
uhoh
trying to 
uhoh
it's like it's got a little bell inside so when she shakes it it it kinda kind of jingles and then it it's got different little textures on it and things
i've seen some like that some of them have things on the sides like a mirror
yeah i think it has a mirror on it
and it's got a little flap
oh
it just has like a pattern on the outside and then when you lift the flap there's a picture of a bear underneath
so she sometimes likes that one
she likes to play with that one
very cool
yeah
cool
well are there any sort of toy related um things that i didn't ask you that you think are are pertinent to what she's interested in at this point
toys or objects or things
i think she ends up um kind of crawling amongst her sisters' toys a lot so she um
you're influenced huh
yeah she is very influenced by the two year olds and um
you know so a lot of the like smaller plush toys little teethers and things that i had when her sisters were infants um i just haven't even really taken out for her because it's just too much stuff
so she's happy enough crawling among their things right
yeah she is and they have a lot of like cars you know not not things that um you know have small pieces or anything like that
right
just things that
things that um
things you might not normally buy for a seven month old
but she's getting exposed to them anyway
yeah
well that's very good
okay well that's all i needed to ask you at this point
okay
so we can
and you did such a great job ellie
couldn't have asked for a better happier baby
yeah
yeah
have to remember that to bring a bottle with me next time too
okay
okay
um okay so which of the toys did he seem most interested in
the keys
the bee
the um measuring cups
okay which toy would you say is good for his personality
um the bee
um he likes to grab things and put it in his mouth
and then growl and talk to it
so he seemed to like the bee the best
okay and as far as the other ones like why do you think he's not
oh this he went for this because i think he liked the noise
and i was surprised he just grabbed the whole bin over
um i don't know
and i guess i don't do stuffed animals that much so
i didn't really grab for that a whole lot
okay so would you say that's the what he was least interested in
yeah but i don't know if i really gave him an opportunity to uh really play in there
i think he was most interested in the things he could put in his mouth and shake and
yeah
um which book did you would you say your your child prefers to that you read to him or which
um you mean here or in general
in general
well both here and then i don't know if at home you
um he likes the ones with baby faces
baby faces okay
ones that he can chew on
are there any items that you think he knows the names for
i don't think so
so most things he you wouldn't think he knows the name for
i don't think so
nicky wanna play with the bee
nicky where's the bee
no i don't
what's that
he's on a mission
yeah
um do you have any toys like these at home
um yes
we have books
we have dolls
we have stuffed animals
um we don't have like a bin of toys that he gets into
okay
do you think he prefers books over toys or toys over books
toys over books
okay
do you ever play with pretend food or pretend to feed dolls at home
no
yes he does play with pretend food
his sister's pretend food
but we don't pretend to eat
he eats eats
does he play with any of his sister's dolls
yes
he rolls around with them on the bed
don't you
okay well i think we're good
seemed to interest him the most
do you think
i think he was a fan of the peas
and the keys
haha the peas and the keys
and why do you think
and actually the the plush toys too
i'm surprised that he wasn't interested in the books
at home he loves his books
really
oh why
but he has he has specific
i'm sorry what were you gonna ask
no i was just gonna ask like why do you think he was more like interested in those
i don't know
i mean clearly the keys he's interested in because he can chew on them
and he's teething
so anything he can chew on right now
and they make noise
when he shakes them
not really sure about the peas
that's my guess
and he also was going after the plush things more than he does at home
he has lots of stuffed animals that he generally ignores and goes more for the books at home
so who knows
do you think probably because these stuffed animals are like new to him maybe
they might be
and i think i know with his books at home he he definitely has favorites
and those are the ones that he always that we read over and over
because the none of these were
i actually thought he'd love this one we have where is baby's belly button
but maybe since these were different they weren't he wasn't as drawn to them
oh okay
but these being different were apparently interesting to him so
out of all the stuffed animals which one do you think he had most interest with
um what was the first one
that chicken
where is it
here yeah
yeah
haha is this a funny chicken
don't gag yourself mister
so out of all the toys which one would you say he liked the least
oh the least
yeah
all the toys that are here
or all the toys that he played with
all the toys that are here
i mean some of them he didn't even look at
he was re he seemed really indifferent to the baby doll
haha
um
what did you like the least jack
do you feel like he played with a lot of the foods
i was gonna say the food stuff he wasn't that interested in
i mean with the exception of the peas
yeah
the food probably the food stuff in general he was least interested in
do you think if you said any of the names of the items would he recognize them
not at this point
i don't think so no
i mean
if you said like peas would he know that's peas
cookies is cookies
the only thing he would probably know is if there was
well i actually just noticed this
like he might recognize this he does he has a cup
that he drinks water from
but i i i would be
no i don't think he would recognize the names of the other foods
okay and do you have any toys like this at home other than like just the stuffed animals and books
um stuffed animals and books
we don't have any of this kind of food stuff no
okay and you were reading that book to him
wh do you see if there were any items that really interest him in that one
in this one
i mean it's the flaps
the flaps
yeah
like which flaps did he like
um i think he liked the ones that were
like he liked the umbrella
and he liked the he had trouble with um the curtains
he liked this one the ball
he's a big fan of balls
that's why i was trying to make this into a ball type object
because he seems to really
be a fan of balls lately
yeah i would say the ball in here and the umbrella
okay
were the two that he were the two flaps he liked
okay would you overall say that he's interested in books or toys
i'd say that he has a runny nose
here or at home
here
here
toys
toys
and at home you would say books
well
it's hard to tell
i would say it's probably much more equal at home
okay okay
and have you ever played pretend food at home
we haven't
you haven't
you like to watch mommy and daddy cook
with real food
and we explain real food to you
but we don't have plastic food
so do you think he'll recognize any of the foods at home
um outside of dog food
haha
probably not yet at this point
i mean he he watches us
and he's very interested in what we're doing
but i don't know that there's recognition yet between you know
milk
and flour
and chicken and that kind of stuff
okay and i'm assuming he probably doesn't play with any dolls at home
um well i'm not gender i mean we don't we don't have any just because he's the first
um but i will say that we were at friend's house a few weeks ago
and she has a son and a daughter
and they got lots of trucks and lots of dolls
and we don't have either
we don't t we don't have trucks for him yet or dolls
and he was very interested in the trucks so
haha
okay well that's good
we have st lots of stuffed animals
but we don't have baby dolls yet do we
no we don't
okay and that is it
you love these
you love these keys
reach them
okay
it's been about fifteen minutes
so haha i'm just gonna ask you a few questions
sure
i'm not going to be writing anything down because i'll just transcribe off the recording
okay so the first question is which of the toys seemed to interest her the most
well she certainly liked the spoons
um she also really liked this bumblebee
yeah
i think those two the most
and which do you think is a good toy for her personality
ha i think the spoons
she likes banging and slapping
she does that on the water when i take her swimming
splashes it up in her face
doesn't bother her one bit
and she also does that with her puppy
she like hits hits her
haha the we actually have two puppies
but the smaller one doesn't mind renee doing that at all
and the bigger one just kinda walks away
haha so one where she can be like that is a good toy for renee
yeah haha
which of the toys seemed to interest her the least
i think the plain boxes
like this one and this one and this one
these seemed to do nothing for her
i mean there are obviously other ones she ignored
she never picked this up
in terms of the ones she actually looked at and didn't pay attention to
it would be these
which book did you prefer or which book do you think your child would prefer to read out loud with you
that's a good question i didn't look at any of the other ones
i picked my favorite
oh i don't know
we do have good night
i don't know
i'm gonna guess mister brown she seemed to like the sounds
but that could be projecting
haha okay were there any items you think she didn't know the name of
oh i don't think she knows the name of any of these
i really don't
haha do you have any toys like any of these at home
i don't think we have any food
we do have stuffed animals but um only a couple
we she has a little pink doggie and then a bigger bear
but like these per se
not really
i mean her little pink doggie isn't far off from you know being like that but isn't exactly like that either
so no not really
and books we have plenty of books
do you think she prefers books or toys
toys
but she likes both
but yeah toys
she likes chewing on books
she likes chewing on toys better
haha do you ever play with pretend food or pretend to feed dolls at home
no we don't
um does she play with dolls at home
hunhunh
no
okay
and that's it
we probably got enough at this point of the play session
but whenever you're ready here he can just hang out i guess and play with that stuff
i just wanted to ask you a few questions about what you thought
okay
that looked like a good lunch
um let's see well first of all what do you think he was most interested in
um i think the i think the baby caught his attention
just it was you know something similar
i think he likes looking at other kids so that that kind of caught his attention
we don't have dolls like that at home
so maybe that was another thing that was new
yeah we don't have a baby at home
so you think maybe because it was different
i think it was it was different and it was it looked like another
i think it was something that he kind of recognized
um and he could he could relate to it
i don't know
like it i think it i think that caught his attention
you were saying penelope
oh we have a a friend of ours actually they were the ones that recommended us to call here
um and she looks you know very similar to that
so they play together sometimes
okay is that your playmate
okay so that's penelope
so you said you th so okay
so you think that was some something that looked familiar
he could relate to the baby and the baby for that reason
i think so
and then what other toys do you think that he was interested in
um this toy and i think it's because of this funny you know
he touched it and he was really looking at this part of it
i picked it because of the colors
he usually likes that
but he seemed to always whenever this part was just sticking up he
he would go for it
yeah
so i think it's just a interesting look and texture to it
and it's easy to grab
that's true it's easy to pick up
he sure does seem interested in that
what do you think interested him the least out of everything that you guys looked at
well the other thing i wanted to mention is something like this where he can pick it up and bang it
like he likes things that they make that
i think i think at home too he's like that
if it makes that noise he likes to usually he'll take it and he'll bang it on on the table
um i don't think he
the stuffed animals kind of
like he would pay attention to it and then he'd go onto something else that made noise
so um you know i tried to bring more of these to the table
and he would look at it for a second
and then he seemed to kind of move on
i think noise and texture
you're trying to reach it aren't you buddy
here you go
yeah
and also i noticed that the pitcher has a handle
maybe that's
yeah
the pitcher yup he liked to
and you know like his like his sippy
he was he puts everything to his mouth but
he was doing pretend drinking
i think so or he just recognized the handle
and it was easier for him to i think the big thing is it was easier for him to pick up
yeah that's cool
did you i think you looked at a book didn't you
is that something that he's seen before
is that one you have at home
um yeah we do it at bedtime
it's alw maybe he associates it with sleep
but it's always during naps and bedtime
when we do the books so
um and usually he likes to look at them but not that particular book
yeah i didn't see him really look at the pictures
or he's just not into books right now
um maybe yeah i don't know if he's just that into a book right now
i usually have him sitting here
and i don't know if me showing it to him maybe had something to do with it
but he's always in my lap and i have it in front
it's a little bit different situation
yeah i'm not sure if that's it but
okay here you go
you sort of mentioned a few things
i was going to say are there any items that you think he recognized but also recognized the names of
i know you were talking about some of the animals
um do you think he would recognize the name of any of those you showed him
i don't think so
i haven't seen signs of that at home
so i don't think so
okay which ones did you guys look at
i can't remember
we looked at the frog
um the rooster
the zebra
and there was like a reind deer of some sort
yeah a deer
but um like the rooster there's a toy at home that sings a song about a rooster
and then the frog we have a book about a frog so
and you were making animal sounds for him
yeah
does he like that
yeah yeah especial or if we read a book he likes the different different sounds for the different characters
or you know different sounds for the animals
so he seems interested in that
um so you said you don't have any dolls at home but it sounds like you have books that you do at um sleeping time
do you have any of the dishes or um stuffed ani like little um beaniebaby type animals
yeah we do
we have um we have some stuffed animals at home
and he'll play with them
and usually again that's um
like when we go down when he goes down for a nap or at bedtime we sit on the floor in his nursery
and we look at books and little stuffed animals and he just
maybe that's my fault for breaking stuff up into
you know the downstairs play stuff is very much the loud the banging stuff the things that make music
and when we go upstairs and he's ready for bedtime we play with stuffed animals and books
yeah
if it works for you guys it's fine
um do you think he prefers books or toys or do you think it depends on um what time it is
um you know what i actually think that i think he does prefer things that make noise
and um yeah that that definitely gets his attention
and i forget what did you say about the pretend food
did you do you have anything like that at home
um well this one
there's a actually we have a a spoon we have spoons this size
and there's one that's purple
he loves to whenever he's eating he loves to play with it
and i let him i say you know you can play with it and then you have to take three bites and then you can play with it again
so i let him play with a spoon periodically during meals
um and then there's things like tacos
like my husband likes tacos so that's why
um but like i think the spoon was pretty much the only thing that like i kind of let him play with at mealtime
i don't like give him the dish
yeah that's what i thought he might recognize
yeah and he doesn't do dolls at home
um what other category
do you think he recognized any of the food items you talked about like tacos
no i don't think so he's still um he's still eating just like the pureed stuff and yeah
i just was playing
i don't think he recognized it yet
um and then just let me ask you about does he have any nicknames
i think i heard
his nickname
yeah
ja jackaroo
yeah jackaroo and booboo
and then you were saying some words in another language too
yeah um tagalog
so we're trying um
i know random words so whenever i remember them i try and use them
and then we have a book at home um that i read to him at bedtime
and it's it's english and tagalog
so it talks about like how to say the word in in a different language
so you're going to be trying to do that as he grows
yeah yeah i don't know it well enough for him to like know exactly how to translate sentences
but i'll like if i know the word for water i'll just insert it into the sentence
that's what my parents did with me
it was kind of english and tagalog at home
yeah
okay that's great
um i think that's all i was
oh you did look at a clock right
yeah
how was that
um he looked at it for a little bit
i didn't it didn't catch his attention like i thought it would because
because of the colors
yeah
i thought the colors would be and the eyes
but he didn't
yeah not as not like i thought he would
he didn't respond
maybe when you're in kindergarten we'll go back to clocks
all right um can you think of anything else we need to ask
um did you use spanish
um no i just tagalog is yeah that's um
my parents spoke a little bit of it at home
and their fear was that i would get confused
and but i hear that it's actually better to do it from the beginning because they won't be confused
so i just try and like i said use it whenever i can
because there were some similar words
yeah it's very similar
you know hearing some of those words i thought it was
because you're a spanish speaker
yeah
very similar yeah
there's a lot of words that are very similar
are you hungry
okay well i think that's all that we need to ask you
okay
i'm just gonna ask you a couple of questions
ah and so which toys do you think um are the most interesting to him
and do you think they're good for his personality
ah um i think the ones that he can chew on are the ones that he likes the best
i'm actually surprised he didn't try to chew on your books
he enjoys that a lot at home
okay
does he play with similar toys at home
um we've got i don't know what other things like this
he likes to chew on books
we've got little blocky things plasticy things we stack
and then he's got some
mostly he chews on things
mostly he chews on books
haha and books like the like the he got a plastic chewy one
i haven't gotten him
i mean he's got little blocks whatever
i haven't gotten him tons of toys christmas is coming up
um so which ones do you think he was the least interested in
the stuffed toys
i i tried to show him a couple of those
he didn't
didn't really even look twice
alright so do you do you think there are any toys here that he didn't know the name of
like if you said
like this is a frog
do you think he would know
i don't think so
you don't think so
i don't think so
he might know dog and cat
but i don't know that he knows any
oh no
so you would say that he prefers books over toys you think
only in the sense that you can chew on them haha
ah but he likes to be read to
um but i mean he likes these kind of things
anything he can put in his mouth you said
yeah haha
anything he can put in his mouth
um does your he play with any like dolls or figures at home
um what has he got
not really
i mean i've got him a um like a little lovie thing in his crib
he just he ignores that
we've got some stuffed things that make noise
he likes when i play with them
and they make noise
but he doesn't seek out
oh the ducks
you like your ducks
he does like ducks
he's got he's got some we got some floatie ducks
that's the thing i think he likes the best
but again he sticks the head in his mouth like a pacifier
but he does like his duckies
is there anything else you think we should know about his play at this time
um
that i haven't asked about already
i don i don't know
it pretty much
he likes tupperware too
ah okay
i'm trying to i'm like trying to think like what do we got
we're got
i don't know
we got little things
oh i thought he would like these he's got he's got keys at home that he likes
i thought he'd like these
but he didn't
alright well
i guess because he's gotten new and exciting things
okay i think we're just about done
so
alright
we're good
yeah i just have a few questions to ask you actually
but he can keep playing
oh okay well for him right now playing is just putting everything in his mouth
that's how he's learning
and those two teeth coming through the bottom everything
oh look at mommy's
so just which toys do you think were the most interesting for him to play with
and which ones do you think fit his personality the best
i mean toys that he's really into right now are block toys that if i build up he can knock them down which is why i started stacking the cans
but otherwise it's stuff that's just easily he can hold easily and put in his mouth
so i mean what he went for once i put them out were these cookies which are really wet and disgusting and the peas
oh you're giving them to me thank you
and i think he arto automatically recognized books because we read books a lot but
ew
um he doesn't play with plush animals very much so put because everything is going in his mouth
those you think would interest him the least out of all the toys we have here
would interest him the least
it's probably the the stuffed an or the big baby doll
he wouldn't know what to do with the big baby doll
we haven't played with them at all
okay so do you guys have pretend food at home
no we don't ha
i mean because he's not really doing pretend play yet
so most of his toys are more sensory right now
so things that he can touch and eat and make noise and things like that
so no he doesn't have any pretend food
so what types of toys do you guys play with at home besides
you said you have sensory
uh well he has um blocks
he has a piano that he he pats and it makes noise
he um has like some shape sorters that have like different holes and he that he can take things out and put them in
look at you rolling
he has like a sound like entertainment board thing
so mostly things like that
oh he can roll over
he's not crawling yet though
do you think that he recognizes any of the types of food that you would have here
um no i mean his food is all mush
um and we don't necessarily really eat in front of him because we eat after him
so would he recognize the food
not really
okay
he recognized the spoons i think though
those he recognized
yes you do have big teeth coming in
judy did you have any questions
do you have any well just i don't know i saw you playing some little thing
do you have any like routine kinds of play peekaboo or any of those
one of the things we've been doing a lot lately
um for christmas he just got um these kind of squishy stacking blocks
so i stack up the blocks
and i count them up
and then he knocks them over
and then usually he's chewing on one at the time
and he'll use the one that he has in his hand to knock it over
he does play peekaboo
he likes it best when we cover his head
and he pulls the the cloth off
and then we all cheer
so the one two three that was part of the like stacking
yeah that's what we do
that's a fun game
that's a fun game
he's he's just figured out that he can roll to get places
so he's been doing that a lot lately
you're sharing with me huh
he just started flipping on the changing table too
haha which is not very fun
that's not a good idea
so i think that's all
easy enough
i would probably um get rid of get rid of that
okay
if you don't mind i wanted to ask a couple of questions
about
the play session
let's see
hey you
um
which toys do you think that
he liked the most
he seemed to like the dog a lot
yeah
i dunno that's cause it's the first one or
heehee
what what haha
where there any that you found that he
disliked
not really
he he did his typical
thing with the book where sometimes we come up with pictures
and other times he just wants it closed
and just eats around haha
so
do you think that
uh do you think that he likes toys or books
it depends on
the time of day and
how
alert
he is how tired he is
really
seems to huh
or it
maybe it's just our routine and what i'm
usually doing
with him
i don usually sit and try to read books with him
unless his brother's napping
because it's just
too difficult
so
oy
are there any specific books at home
you have similar
yeah
but we
go to the library and we've
lots of like board books
do you
play um
like activities and do you guys do anything
or games or
not planned
just kinda spread out
yeah
right
haha
haha
nothing
ha
nothing um
we're not doing preschool or anything
i know
i know
i thought um
the food items
here
do you think he recognized any of them
no
you couldn't imagine
no
well everything he gets is pureed
right now
so
it doesn't look like
that i mean he he's been eating peas for days on end
but
heehee
i don't i don't think there's any recognition at all
we don't even know
what really peas look like
huh
right
eh
um
and then any stuffed animals
maybe that he
recognized
he's seen dogs before
and maybe that's why he
preferred or seemed to prefer that over the frog
um
or seemed more interested
he hasn't see frogs haha
so
but w have a couple of
diff dog
animals as well as you know
friends have
real dogs
so
okay
we didn't really
try anything else
do you think that um
do you guys play with dolls maybe or
um ha
not at the moment
we kind of rotate
the toys out
so
we we have one
baby doll and
she's been
or he whoever
it has been packed up
um
okay
so
yeah
okay um
i think
let me try to think what else you may have played with
here
you did choose to play with that book as opposed to
these was that was that just the closest one
it was
yeah
sorry about that
that was the yeah it was the closest one
these end any you might find at home
we do have doctor seuss books but not
board books
so they wouldn't be ones i would think
for him
um
because he's all about
crinkling
mashing
haha so
i don't wanna do that with the
older books
typically at this age right
yeah
and they go in his mouth
so
the other books it has to be a board book or a plastic
ya know
because otherwise it's just destroyed
yeah
and then i guess he was playing with the keys and
we played
a little bit
did you think he recognized
the like regular real life items
i don't know
i don't know if he recognizes or if it's just easy to hold onto
ha
he does have a few things that have rings
um
and i guess
uh in a large sense he does have his own
keys like they don't look anything like keys to me but they're supposed to be
you know
keys on a ring haha
yeah
so
he could be
you're into peanut
alright well i think
i think that's it i think we got through
everything
i really appreciate your time
coming in
sure
thanks
a few questions
sure
about this session
um
which toys do you think amelia seemed most interested in
anything
haha
i mean at this point i can
you know
give her
a napkin and she's happy so
it ha
anything she's
she can have with the most toys
or non toys
haha
which toys here do you think she was most interested in
um
she seems to like the
peek you know the
the food
she also
we'd actually don't have a baby at home
she kinda likes that
i think
um
she likes head shoulders knees and toes
so she was definitely smiling
when i was doing that
on the baby
um
which toy do you think is good for her personality
um
haha is that yummy
um
anything really i mean at this point
as long as she can put it in her mouth
it makes her happy
so
yeah
what do you think um interests her
um
t
she likes f
she likes faces
um
see
haha
she looked over at you a couple times
so
you know
she's like why isn't she looking back at me
ah
um
she likes
you know like when my camer
when i take pictures of her and it
makes noises
she likes that
ah
but we tend to not actually have very many
toys that require batteries on around the house
yes
um
so
it may just because
it may be
that she likes that type of thing because she's not
used to it as much
i dunno
um which one do you think she was le
which toys here
do you think she was least interested in
um
uh
she seems sorta interested in the books
but she tends not to be very into books
okay
um
she tries to close them most the time haha
um
and she didn't really care about
um
and we never even got over there
okay
so
some of the food
she didn't really care
about
okay
um do you think that there are any items that um
actually
we'll that can be for next time
haha
that will be good
oh that's a good plate huh
which book um
do you think amelia would
uh prefer to read
or look at with you
um
i this the baby peekaboo or
we didn't look at it but the on the farm
okay
um
she liked
she likes the peekaboo ones
and does she play with any similar toys at home
um
we don't have
food at home
like i said we have the book that's like this one
um
i was stacking these we stack a lot of things and
okay
um
you know like stacking toys
so
and i'm
although
as i said
that i'm gonna regret it
but i'm always
ha showing her how to bang things together
haha ha
which fortunately she doesn't seem to care about at this point
so
okay
and do you think she's more
prefers books or toys
toys
she preferred
yeah
okay
and you said that she doesn't have a doll at home
no
okay
she has a lot of stuffed animals
but no dolls
and you said you don't have any pretend food at home
no
but do you think that amelia maybe recognized any of the foods
um
from maybe home
ah
probably not she's still eating so much
baby food
that
you know i don't
i don't think she'd necessarily recogni
and she's actually usually goes to bed before we eat dinner
so
um
i don't
i don't think so
okay
and at this point do you think amelia um recognizes
the names of any of these items
or is beginning to
um
the only one that i would say would be milk
we do um
we're starting a little bit of sign language with her
and we do milk and eat and more
um
and so she's actually started signing milk
we're not really sure if she knows
that it's
goes with milk
you know she's started doing this
but we don't know if she's doing it
at the times when she's hungry
um
but when we ask her if she wants milk
if she's hungry she usually smiles so
i don't know if that means she
knows what it means or not
or if she's just happy that
you know likes when we talk to her
are there any items that aren't here that you think your child recognizes the name of
um
no
not yet
okay
is that yummy
ah
you want more pizza here
ah
yummy yummy yummy
yummy yummy yummy
okay so i just have a couple questions
um okay so which toys did he seem most interested in
um the soft stuff i think just because he could put it in his mouth
like this clock
i mean he's just into that phase right now where everything in his mouth is what he
an toda like today in particular
so i would say anything soft
anything he can put his hands on
he wasn't interested in making any kind of noise or anything like that
like he is sometimes depending on the toys he has at home
toy that you would say is best for his personality
oh i would say the keys usually because they make noise
yeah he can see like he seems to be
i don't know if this is possible yet but he seems to know that when he does something there's a reaction with the keys
um which of the toys seemed to interest him the least
um i don't i don't think like he doesn't i think maybe this peanut because he doesn't recognize it
um i tried to make noise with it a little and that didn't seem to be didn't seem to do anything for him
it up and put it in his mouth and that was about it
um do you read books at home
yes
you do
okay from the books here which
well he didn't you know not
books and so we're having trouble with him like even paying attention for short as that
like trying to read it without him grabbing it
um so we have that mister brown we have other short stories like that
um so we try to get through them as fast as we can
because and then get on to the next book because he's not really looking at the pictures
his goal is to
okay
and do you think he recognizes names of any of these items
no
i don't think so no
were there any items that you think he's never seen before
um well he's seen similar things
but like this peanut that was new
um he has the winnie the thing
and my daughter has a lot of kitchen stuff
so even though he was
this we don't have but he's got similar things
um do you have any toys that are the same at home
none that are the exact same
no
so you said you have some food but not
we have food and we have stuffed animals and we have books but nothing other than that mister brown
okay if you had to choose between books or toys would you say he prefers books or toys
oh i'd say toys
definitely yeah
um do you ever actually play with pretend food and pretend like you're feeding dolls at home
uh my daughter does with him
and i mean he's around so i don't think
i'm not doing it with him but she's doing it
and he's wa and he's seeing her
so i don't know if that counts as well as playing with him doing it
okay
does he ever play with dolls at home
not yet
okay
well i think that is all we have
well i have a few questions to ask you if you don't mind
and she can just sit on your lap
yeah you like that better huh sitting on mom's lap
it's funny the books
sabrina's just gonna play with
she can hang onto her keys if she wants
she can let go of them yeah
she likes those
it was so interesting that she really didn't she really didn't like those books
yeah i i wonder what
it's interesting because we really only read books at night
so she associates the
it may be
the books at night
it may be
and the rocking chair
it wouldn't be the first time
we usually don't read that often during the day just at night
haha and she you know huh
so what so um it seemed like yeah it was pretty obvious she liked
the things she could rattle
the keys and and um
i was just gonna ask you why do you think she liked those
was it something about
i mean we have a pair that are that are not like those but probably kind of similar
like a different
i don't know if she recognizes like the ones she has at home
she has much like bigger ones but
that are also the keys
they're kind of like keys
they have i mean they're they're keys
but they're different brand of them
so i don't know if she recognizes as a toy that she's used to
she like that one at home too
yes
she likes to shake 
what else does she did you think that she liked
um the measuring cups she seemed to really enjoy
oh
probably because they're the same um concept as
hanging on a circular
shaking 
making noises
uhoh they made some noises didn't they
you like all the noises
um well which what do you think um in general are toys that are good for her personality
um she does seem to like at home
i mean with all the toys at christmas that make noises and do things
like putting balls in something
she's starting to do things like that
um but that make noises like noise
and she knows they come out the bottom
kind of looking to see what happens and
starting to figure some things
like the cause and effect kinds of things
starting to figure out cause and effect a little bit more than
oh
well if you drop a toy shh she looks for it now
do you do that
well you like those k
are you gonna look at those keys
what do you think interested her the least of what we have here
um well the book seemed to make her upset for some reason
not really sure why
i wonder if it does have to do with
yeah i don't know
she didn't seem to wanna wanna do that
and i don't know if it's it's hard to she can't really suck on books quite as easily not shake 
they're just not quite as fun
yeah
for her to hold and play with
um the animals she she kind of lost interest in them
um we actually don't have a whole lot of stuffed animals at home
okay
have to do with it
but we have a couple different things
but not more kind of toys that she can hold onto
yeah i think there have been a few other kids
toys that we can clean easily we have at
yeah
so have anything to do with it
she just
she didn't really care for those
at least not at this visit
no not really
okay
she kind of stared at the doll for a while
oh okay
she likes that
she does stare at like faces a lot
is that what she was doing
i couldn't tell
she was just pretty much looking at the baby's face
and that was about it but
i've noticed other children she'll just stare and laugh at smaller kids
much more than at adults
oh interesting
so when you're out and about or whatever and you see
she goes to daycare
and there's eight infants in her class
oh okay
yeah we will have to
um well i know she didn't like the books today
but does she have any at home that she likes in particular
that one we do read a lot
and then we have one called the belly book that she seems to really
those are her favorites
those seem to be her favorites
so you do do books
yeah the fluffy chicken
she likes to feel the different textures
fluffy chicken
is that what you like
and that one has textures in it like
and then she like feels the different fur on it
but i think the keys are about her favorite
um i was g you might have already mentioned that about the keys being something that she may recognize from home
and anything else that we have here that you feel like she might recognize from that you have at home
or that she might recognize from daycare
um not re i mean we don't really have any of the kitchen stuff yet and all the
we don't really have any of that yet at home
yeah there's a lot of that
i mean just little animals you know we have some of those at home
just like little beaniebabies things
but not a whole lot
i would say this is probably the most like our toy at home
what were you saying sabrina
would she recognize some of the foods like in real life
yeah i don't i don't know if she would recognize them or not
or if she
she seemed to like the can
like the soup can
and i yeah i d yeah i mean
what do you think she liked about th
she did sort of engage with that a little bit
one in the grocery store
i don't know what other experience with she has
did she play with those when she was in here
yeah
i mean i always kind of try to stack them up for her
she's kind of pushing them around
although i think at home she likes balls
like pushing balls around on the floor
oh they kind of do that
kind of
i saw her playing with like the slices
oh yeah the p oh the pizza slices
yeah
i don't i don't
you liked that for a while
and maybe it was small it could fit in her hand
she could easily grasp it put it in her mouth
grasp it
that could be
she could really hold onto it
like she's holding onto the
haha
are not your keys
do you think she in general prefers toys or books
um i feel like toys
i think a lot of daycare there's
more toys
more toys than books
okay and
i mean books she likes sometimes you know she'll try to turn it every now and then
does she
like we were actually went on vacation a couple weeks ago
and her stroller it's kind of give her a book
and see she would kind of open
right megan
a lot of open close kind of thing
we have like a little baby laptop kind of thing at home
oh wow
and she likes to just shut it
and then she'll try to open
and then shut it again
do you do any um games with her like back and forth games um or like rhymes
or like
yeah i mean like that kind of stuff yeah
the peekaboo she's starting to really get the hang of it now
much more than she really going on before
but she'll kind of like look for us
oh wow okay
if we duck
my husband duck down she'll kind of look
blanket
we'll play it
and that's fun yeah
she's generally just a very happy baby
she certainly seemed like it
anything kind of really excites her
you think she's pretty active
yeah
you're a well adjusted little girl
huh you've seen a lot of other babies
well i think that's all we have
did you have any questions before um we wrap it up
not really
uh now i just wanna go over a couple questions
oh okay
i'm not gonna be writing down any answers so uh
that's fine
we have the you know you have the mic on and that kind of stuff so
yeah
um
ah not in your mouth
i was just wondering um which of the toys you thought that raina liked the most
this
the spoon
the spoon or i dunno
between the spoon and the keys
but she's determined to have the spoon how i put it over there
all gone
it's all gone
do you um do you have similar toys at home
yes
we have a baby doll
we have the books and we have the keys
we usually don't play with the spoon except when it's time to eat but we do have that at home too
one that she bangs on
you can't have that
not the microphone
no no no
i didn't notice if you picked up any books
we we read the we had this one and this one
we have some like this at home
like the touch book
does she um does she like those at home
you know obviously
she usually bangs the pages
in the flip book which is what she was trying to do here
then she put it down and saw the baby doll
okay
so do you think she like books more or toys more
um i don't know
i don't know that she has a preference
whatever is closest to her in her line of sight is what she wants
um do you play with pretend food at home
um no we don't
no you don't have any of those
no
um but dolls
yeah she has a doll
i have a three year old niece so they each have to have their own doll because she has a baby and she wants the baby so
oh
it's a little baby for her
so she knew what the baby was
funny
uh do you think raina recognize any foods
i know that you were presenting her with some foods
yeah
i don't think so
say i have eaten any of that stuff yet
keys
and do you think she recognize any animals
the names of any animals
no
which names do you think out of everything that she that you played with that she did recognize whether it be the specific names
oh i don't know
we have a book similar to this with the ducks on it which is why i pulled out the duck book
and we have a bee book at home and so i pulled out the bee to play buzz
we have a book about that at home so
those are the ones that i pulled out just because
we read about those
see like she wants that one we have one like that at home
the farm book
do you
oh sorry
no go ahead
do you play
peekaboo
yeah
you do
i thought she might like the book
she wants to close the pages
that's what she does at home
i have an a b c and you lift up the flap and there's a picture of the baby on the inside
we open the flap peekaboo
but she didn't play
she just closed the book she wants to hold it
well she wants eat them all
and i guess the last question i noticed when we came in you said you have this clock at home but you didn't
no we didn't play well because we have it at home so
i was like oh they have other let's play with all the other stuff they have
yeah we don't have this book or that
that's funny
we have something similar but not the same
okay well great i think that's pretty much it unless you wanted to comment
do you have any questions about anything
no
it was fairly enjoyable
like she seems malleable enough
so i want to talk to you for a few minutes about
what your impressions were what things
she liked and didn't like
alright
should i keep this on or
yeah
okay
so
first of all are there any of these toys you have at home
uh
we have a book like this
that you know she likes the ones she can touch and stuff like that
and then peekaboo she likes just to play peekaboo
so i thought that would be good um
she has she doesn't have any of these things these are all except
for like a spoon that she's you know
learning to eat with in theory
and there are some stuffed animals at home
that she she likes
you started off with the books was there a particular reason for the
cause i know she likes the little touch and feel book yeah
so i thought well this might be a good way to start off
and when i realized she was trying to eat the book i'm like maybe she needs something to chew on
yeah cause you have some teeth but i think more are coming in
yeah
yeah
um you were searching through the food items
was there particular things your were looking for do you think there were some she would already know
yeah she i think she definitely knows peas we have we have eaten peas before
and i was just thinking the things that would be easy for her to kinda of
pick up and put in her mouth and some of like the things like the plates are kind of flat and kind of hard to probably pick up
i thought these these guys might be a little on the heavy side
but she liked the ice i was like let's find all the ice
and all those together
yeah
do you eat ice cones at home
nope not yet
not yet
something particularly familiar
no not at all i think it was just you know it was a cool a cool shape i thought she'd she'd probably like that
yeah
yummy
and the particular animals i know it was a bit of a reach for some of them
yeah i mean this this thing just looked
the little these little guys
yeah
uh huh
yeah i tried to get the duck because that was the duck if she really wasn't ugh too interested in the duck
uhoh
waffles down
here you go
more waffles
yeah
so which do you think she liked the least or was least interested in
i think she was probably least interested in this and the chicken
didn't really seem to care too much about it
um i think she liked all these things she put them in her mouth
essentially
i like this it made her laugh
yeah
is that yummy
dolls do you have dolls at home
no dolls no
not yet
lots of little stuffed animal type things
so that's a reason to have stayed away from the doll
or the baby or whatever
where or was the oh oh i didn't even realize it was there
it was kind of covering it's own eyes
yeah we have a um we have lots of like dog stuffed animals at home i don't know if i guess that little pink thing is a dog over there
yeah
yeah
i just thought this was interesting looking
it is
i like the little yeah
i thought she'd get a kick out of that
yummy lily
yeah
what kinds of toys do you does she play at home
she has a lot of um
i guess is there kind of like
the stuff like that you know hangs from the little gym
that makes the little noise
things that rattle
she recently discovered blocks which she she loves
mainly she can put them in her mouth
but you know she can you know she does she picks them up she kind of plays with them and then she just goes oh there is a new shape of a block
stuff like that so that that's been a big favorite recently
are the blocks i guess these are kind of like the blocks
she can pick them up put them in her mouth and stuff like that
yeah
particularly cloth ones or plastic ones
plastic
plastic ones we do have
um well basically it was like an easy wash them and stuff but we do have like those
big bigger ones that are cloth and some of them like you know pick them up and they have like a little rattle in them or one has a like mirror on the side and they have the different textures and things like that
and she likes them but i think she likes the little ones better mainly she can hold on to them put them in her mouth
kind of like that one huh
yeah just like that one
yeah
you like that for awhile now
that that's some good drool lily
yeah
that's some good work drool
is there does she have a general preference for toys versus books or
um
no i don't think so
i mean like the books she likes to grab the pages
and but then she will eat the books
i mean basically like these these are the good ones
anything that has real paper forget it
you know she will yeah
yeah they they get very mushy
yeah
and you know um
yeah
but what basically whatever she can kind of get to
i think that's to do with proximity at this point
how close it is
yeah
can i have a smile
looking very serious lily
very serious
anything i didn't ask
that i should
i don't know i mean
she i don't know if she is much of a kind of like a or more times she can be more talkative but she does like she does the giggling a whole lot
she was speaking a lot earlier
yeah
yeah
tickling her
with this thing she she you know she definitely is very giggly
and like when it comes to like the sounds she does a lot of the sometimes the high pitch kind of like shriek squeal type stuff
but
not so much of like a she is not so much of like a she'll she'll i guess she'll like if she is in her crib when she is like you know kind of going to sleep she will kind of like talk her self to sleep then
but if she is actively doing something like this she doesn't really make as much noise
and i don't know if it's she is eating something or she's concentrating
but
yeah
you are not one of those babies that's sitting there all the time going
not
not so much
i mean sometimes she will back noises but but they won't you know
that it's not it's not constant
yeah
okay
so you are wearing a northwestern sweatshirt
yeah
no my husband went there
i am from i went to northwestern so
we we have been to visit
yeah
i haven't been back to visit for a long time
yeah she hasn't been there yet
who knows
my husband is like is she going to be on the lacrosse team i am like okay
that is a long time away
predicting far into the future
exactly even what sport you are going to play
yeah your daddy is silly
yes he is
what are you trying to get trying to get the cup
here you go
yeah
you can get it lily
so the next time you are in we are going to do another one of these lab visits and then another play session again and one of the things we will be looking at is how things have changed
different things she is more interested in obviously this is the youngest age
yeah
we will be able to see see if her areas of interest have changed any
yeah
other than that we are done for today
you were perfect
yay lily
absolutely perfect
she tries she tries
yes you were
she tries to be the best baby ever
yeah
certainly
we basically have things in three different piles
if you were to pick something that he liked the most out of each pile what would you say
okay out of each pile
apparently the chicken was a big hit in the stuffed animal pile
and the spoons and the keys
from the more food pile he likes
he can shake it
but i don't know
he was cur curious about the baby doll
but he really didn't seem to enjoy looking at the books or grabbing the books and stuff
but he was very suspicious of the baby doll
does he have do you have baby dolls at home
we do not
we go over a friend's house who has all girls though
so he's sees them
but i think this is the closest baby doll encounter we've had
were there any toys here or you know books or anything that you think he recognized the names of
i don't know that's a good question
i'm not sure that he did
you know
no out of your mouth
do you think there was anything that was um like you're sure that he was like kind of a new toy or new name for
yeah definitely the see the ah like the ice cone and the baby bottle
he doesn't drink bottles so that was new for him to see that
i was surprised how he didn't he wasn't very interested in it though
but he looked at it and wasn't didn't really wanna play with it though
yeah he's like
i don't know what that is
um do you two read at home together
yes
do you are there any similar books here
he has a book very similar to this one
several touch and feel books like that
and he has the uh the mister brown can moo can you one
okay
so
so you do go over like a different animals and
yeah
we do that yeah going over different animals and
naming and what not
i usually read with his brother as well
so he we name the animals in the books with his brother
and he names them back so
are there any like common recurring animals which setting
um definitely the classic dog cat cow
we hear those a lot
a lot
giraffe his brother's favorite animal right now and fish
so haha we hear those a lot
alright what about a toy that he just doesn't seem to he liked the least
what did ya like the least
it was probably the baby bottle
he had no interest in that at all
even though it had you know you could see stuff move in it
and he was not interested in it at all
so that was surprising
that was surprising to me that even though i set it there he didn't even wanna pick it up
right
whereas other things he'd pick up and at least look at
and he was not interested in it
i was kinda surprised it does the fluid moves in it and it makes bubbles
but he didn't
did not care about that one
okay um are there any activities that you um play at home
we play peekaboo
trying to think
that's our biggest game
he loves it
okay and um do you ever play with pretend food at home
yeah
not a whole lot with him though but
he sees me playing with it with brother more than he plays with
he'll do what he's doing now
he just picks it up and looks at it
and do you have similar pretend food
we don't have pizza
we have a burger though
we do have a burger
we have burger and hot and vegetables and stuff but
he did like the pizza pieces
very colorful
you liked the pizza
and how about the utensils you mentioned he likes
you know he doesn't have he has something like the keys
he doesn't have anything like the spoons
you really like the spoons
but he's got um he's got something like the keys that he can shake
and they go all over
trying
can't remember what they are
they're not keys though
haven't seen the toy in a while it may be lost
but he has something like
makes sense
and um with regards to here did you pick up did you tend to play more with the toys than the books or the books than the
the toys more
the shake the stuff he could shake
is that the same as um at home
yeah
he prefers toys
he prefers toys yeah
okay um
he eats books
and so um is there anything else that we have here that may be similar to what you have at home
well he has lots of stuffed animals and lots of books so
um that's similar
this is more play food than we have though
so i think he he liked that
we don't have a whole lot of play food at home
he really liked that book
he
let's see
we don't have a clock
ah one that they can play with yet
and you guys don't have a baby doll
how's your book
you want your book back
okay ah unless there are any other comments about the toys here
maybe bears or anything thing
we don't have a lot of bears
i have an aversion for bears
we do have like we have the zebra at home
and we have the fox
we have a different donkey
but we have the donkey
so he's these he's seen a lot
so we have very similar ty toys that he plays with
well that's helpful
thank you very much
which of the toys do you think was her favorite
probably this bee
she liked the whatever it is the sticky kind of
does she have any toys
no
which do you think she liked the least
um probably the books
i tried to get her interested in the books
and she didn't really
so do you think she likes more
what do you think she likes more
the toys or the books
um probably toys
she reads like
or she doesn't read
but she plays with her books at home
but she has a shorter attention span with 
probably not
um we have like the little stuffed animals and um the books
but we don't have any of the like kitchen toys
and she has baby dolls
but she doesn't play with yet
do you think she recognizes any of like the food items
probably not
she's still on um like baby food and formula
so we don't really um give her any food
and we usually eat when she's down for her nap unless we're out so
she might recognize that bottle with the orange juice or whatever it is
does she have any dolls
um yeah she doesn't really play with yet
they're just kind of hanging out in her room
um she plays wi a lot with like the teether rings
um sometimes she'll eat 
but sometimes she'll just bang around on stuff
and um she likes to play she has a stuffed elmo
and she loves to play with that and like talk to him
like she's talking to winnie the
and um she likes to play with
um she likes rattles a lot
stuff that make noise
she likes that kind of stuff
that made enough noise for her
um i think the keys were probably the thing that grabbed her attention the most
um like she has a set of keys at home
but um i don't think really any of the other toys made enough noise for her to even notice
um no
this is pretty much how she is
we have two dogs at home though that kind of sit and hang out with her
and she plays with them too
but this is pretty much how she is at home so
sounds good
okay
okay
alright
you can keep playing
um okay
was there a particular group um of toys that she seemed most interested in
the books
okay
books
she hasn't left there in since i sat her down
okay
uh do you have any idea why that might be
we have a lot of books at home
oh
we're a book reading family
her big sister reads books constantly
um
um do you have any of these
we have mister brown over there
um we have goodnight moon in the in a different version not the counting version
um we do have a peek a but not that one
we have a a where is mommy but that same um series
okay
um what about which group was she least interested in
seemed to be the play toy the play food
this one
um why would you say that
um well every time i tried to give her a piece she would look at it for s you know she would hold it but then she would put it down and go right back to the books or to the the bee she had over here
oh
um
so
do you have any play sets at home
we do
we have tea sets and play food and and she plays with them when her big sister is playing with them
but not usually on her own
okay
um okay what about did she like the animals
she did
yeah she really likes this bee
i think the the contrasting colors really got her
yeah
um but she she didn't wanna come over here and check any out
okay
she wanted to stay with the books
um do you think she might recognize any animals
um
probably not
i mean she know she might know winnie the and frogs but not
yeah
yeah i'm talking about you
careful
you're standing on a book silly
there we go
um what about dolls do you guys have dolls at home
we have dolls everywhere
has she played with them
she would like to but again big sister they're her dolls
oh
even the dolls that are hers that are for mackenzie's only um jackie tends to take
so she doesn't get much of a chance to play
um when she's not that interested in them other than to like gum on them and then throw them down so
oh
okay
um i don't she's kinda young but might she recognize any of the foods we have
probably not
no
no
she doesn't eat any of them yet so
she's still on baby food and bottles
okay
she actually she might recognize the bottle
i was a little hesitant to give it to her only because she's getting to be the time when it's her bottle time
oh yeah
and i didn't want her to like scream at me for taking it away
yes
okay
i think you're all done
um what else is there anything else about like the way she plays at home
okay
um
favorite toys or anything
she no she doesn't shh i mean she doesn't really have any favorite toys
she she likes to follow what her big sister is doing
okay
and play with that
or um play with things i don't want her to play with which is pretty normal but
yeah
she does have a favorite um lamb stuffed animal kinda like this size that she sleeps with and cuddles when she's upset
okay
um but not really a play toy
okay
okay
i think we are all done
yeah
toys
okay yeah
um so i just have a few questions to ask you and i'm not gonna be writing anything down just
because we have um paper trans transcription
um but which of the toys seemed to interest him the most so which do you think
um are you speaking about at home or here
um here
uh the babydoll seems to have captivated him the most
and um i don't we don't have dolls at the house so this is surprising to me but
well i shouldn't say surprising he's very interested in other children
and so he will immediately um approach them if if i can bring them to him
and interact and so i'm i guess i'm not so surprised about this
i guess i am surprised that he likes bologna so much
he seems to have gripped onto this quite well
as well as the peanut butter
um and carrot soup but that captivated his interest the most
the face on the on the child on the toy
and um
the stuffed animals
um
and just because of i in fact that's not fair to say because i didn't bring him over to them
but out of practice he
ah generally doesn't enjoy the stuffed animals quite as much as the things that will make noise when you bang them together
do you think there are any items that he recognizes the name of when you say or
um are there any items that you played with that he's never heard of before would you say
peanut butter
any of the the the food goods would have been unfamiliar to him
books he's familiar with
um
i'm not sure these are all different from the ones that we have except for the books
so i would say that everything was unfamiliar except for book
um um so does he generally prefer books over toys
no um he really enjoys both and it depends on his mood
and
i would say toys over books
and
your baby doll again
which book um did your did he prefer to look at with you was there a specific one
just whichever you had
it would be whatever one i grabbed
and that would be the one that he would want to grab
okay um i think we basically touched on all of it
so we're all through really
yay good job good job
i'm going to leave the microphone on
that way i don't have to write anything down
okay
i just wanted to ask you a few questions
okay
if you can just keep playing with him
sure
um so which of these toys do you think interested him the most
or what sort of group of toys
what group of toys
it seemed to be food
food stuff
food
food stuff okay
yeah a lot of babies do for some reason
um do you have any ideas why he's attracted to that more
no
um well i probably because it's little
and he can manipulate it
i think might be why
and it's easy to put in his mouth
right
he knows what that's for
yeah
and um okay so you thought he he was more interested in these
he seemed to focus more on that
oh he
but he
oh really
but um when it was there yeah
does he have any babies at home
no
well i mean he has a couple like stuffed ones
but nothing that looks as real i guess as that
okay
and so he just went over to it
or did you show him or
i think he went over to it initially
um and then later on i brought it over to him
and then was he um feeding the baby or just
no
okay
poking at it
looking at the face
we see that a lot
was he interested in any of the animals
um a little bit
the bee maybe a little bit
but not i don't even think he saw most of them
okay
um and then books
did you do any of the books down there
or the clock
we did um the good night moon book and
oh that book right
is he familiar with that
does he have one at home
um he has that at home yes
not the counting one
the the traditional version
yeah
i hadn't ever seen this before
i haven't either
um let's see
are there any um toys here that we have that he might recognize from at home
um he has a lot of books
but none of the particular books that
okay
so he would recognize that it is a book
is a book
yeah
and how about um names for things
do you think if you said you know any of the names that he would recognize like some of the food things or animals
no
probably not
and what kinds of toys do you think are best for his personality
for what kind of little guy he is
um as far as at home or what he seems to be
yeah just either at home or here
he's active
he's active
okay what kinds of toys does he like at home
he likes um balls and things like that that he can
little ones that he can hold
um rattles or i don't even know what they're called
things with lots of um places to hold onto and turn and
did he try these
yeah and i thought that he would be interested in that
and he didn't seem to really
well now he does
they don't have a really good place to hold on a rattle i guess
they have a small thing at the end
but i thought that would interest him
and a couple times he just
there are some keys somewhere
oh yeah over there
oh here they are
that's that's easier to hold onto
you want the keys
you like those now
he's getting to be too big a boy for those kinds of things huh
yeah he's trying to make them go isn't he
um do you think he prefers books or toys
toys
books tend to go in the mouth a lot
oh i see
do you re um do you like use books at bedtime or
not usually at bedtime
maybe a couple hours before when i get home from work
um after he's changed we usually sit and read a book for a few minutes
usually before dinner
and did i ask you if he has any babies at home
yes
and he doe he has like stuffed ones but nothing
nothing that looks realistic
right
okay and um
when you do read a book with him does he prefer to turn the pages himself or have you do it
um i don't know if he's really turning them or if he's just trying to grab the book to put it in his mouth
sometimes it turns
but i don't know if it's purposeful
yeah at this age they're still pretty oral
yeah
still learning about everything that way
um it may change a lot by the time he comes back
we'll have you do another questionnaire and sit play with the same toys
sometimes there are dramatic changes
sometimes not
um alright i think
let's see
oh do you think he would recognize any of these foods
no
probably not
some of them don't look that much like what they're supposed to be
some of them look a little bit more
they do yeah
okay
is there anything else that i missed that you think would be important to know about what um his toy preference is and how he plays with toys
um no this is typical how he plays
he just scoots from one
yeah and then drop it and then move to something else
yeah i noticed he likes to be on his stomach and kicking
yes
okay
yeah he
so this is the way he plays
this is the way he plays
this is exactly it huh
yup
this is just like it
just like home
and everything goes in the mouth
well we'll clean them all so
so that's uh yeah pretty typical
i think that's all that i have so i'll turn this off
turn this off
um alright i'm actually um gonna ask you a few questions
okay
just um just have some um little interview questions about um which which of the toys he liked
um so which which toys do you think interest parker the most
anything he can put in his mouth right now
oh the teething
yeah
um the keys he seemed to like those
the um the clock he seemed to like that too
at least he was staring at it and banging it up and down
and then the babydoll i think
do you think um other than
do you think other than like the teething do any of the toys um fit his personality more
um
um well he usually is a lot more interested in books
um i guess i don't really give him a toy to play with while we read to him
so he usually is more interested in grabbing the book and touching the book
um he likes the feeling the feeling books
and then i hadn't played with him with the baby before and he was really interested in the baby and and kissing the baby so that was cute
and now also which of the toys do you think that he liked the least
i guess well at first he seemed to like the bee
but then he got a little scared of it
yeah
um and uh which book um would you child pref
or sorry that's what it says on here
but would would parker prefer to look at do you think on a regular basis
um seems like the keys
which toy or which book
actually which which book do you think that
probably the fuzzy the the one that has the the touching stuff in it
right
um and do you have uh any toys that are similar to any of these at home
yeah
um we have books
a lot of books
a lot of books
and um we have a set of keys
i might have to whip them out again he hasn't played with them in a while and he seems really interested in them
yeah
so i might have to find some of those
um we have a couple of stuffed toys with chew things on them
but he doesn't seem interested in those at all
yeah
um do you have like any of the uh pretend food at home
no
no
um and at at this point do you think uh he recognizes the names of any of the items or is he beginning to
um if you ask my husband he recognizes everything
but i don't i don't necessarily think he does
um i don't know maybe book
i think he might know he might recognize book
other than that i would say no
okay
alrighty well we can go ahead and finish up here
okay and turn this off
okay
we just have a few questions for you
let's see
so which toys does she seem most interested in and do you think that
she definitely likes the spoon
okay
and um i think that that she liked the little cups
okay
and i think maybe because um we use them at home
okay
she plays with them at home
okay
so maybe they're familiar
okay
do you have like pretend plates like play plates
we do
we ha i have the same set
oh
so
okay
which is weird
and i have these little fake little cups
okay
maybe that's why
which toys does she seem the least interested in and why do you think that was
um i guess she didn't seem interested in like these big harder thi toys
maybe because they're not as easy to handle
okay
um would you say she prefers toys over books or books over toys
toys over books
toys over books
do you read books at home at all
i do
i read to her but it doesn't she's not very interested right now
okay
and none of these books
um no
we have thi we a similar little one
which she likes a little but she definitely likes toys better
okay
and it did seem like she liked the doll too
which i don't have
okay
um as far as the food items do you think she recognizes the names of any of the food items
um i don't think so
i don't think so
she hasn't
no
it's not like food that you guys eat necessarily that she would recognize
um we do
i don't think she recognizes it ye yet
okay
um you mentioned that you have the the play set do you have any of these other toys at home
um let's see oh i didn't even notice these
i don't have any of these but um yeah we have these little plates and a little pizza little peas
no that's it
okay
what about
let's see what else
oh you said she was playing with like
the little keys
yeah i do have spoons for her
i don't have these little keys
but i have different keys
okay
if you have to pick a toy that you would say is good for her personality what would you pick
um of these
good for her personality you mean goes best with her
um
um
i guess the doll
okay
she seemed to like recognize that it was like a little
or maybe think it was another little baby
and then she was chewing on it
fell on her lap
i guess the doll
okay
um does she use like bottles or the sippy cup
at home
um to eat you mean
yep
she uses both
okay
okay
okay
i think that is all we have for you
okay
so i think that we'll go back to the waiting room and then we can finish filling out the paperwork
okay
i can take that mic
oh
okay
um i just have a few questions
and like i said i was sort of busy doing other stuff which is fine but i wasn't watching everything
that you were doing so can you just describe what you felt like she was most interested in
of all of these toys here
she liked this yellow bumblebee
with the crazy hair
this little bee here
yeah the uh plastic
i don't even know how to describe that
so any i idea why she liked that
um i think it's the colors
um and a different texture
and she likes stuffed animals anyway
she has them at home so um i think she definitely it's the color and the different texture
so she does like these
this type of thing yeah
okay
um which of the toys do you think were her least interesting to her
the books which is surprising we read all the time at home but she definitely did not want um to play with books or see them or
or look at them
she didn't huh
not today
okay
so you're saying normally she does like them
we read every day
yeah
uh or we attempt to read every day at least
but today for whatever reason she's not interested
okay alright um which of the toys that are here do you think are the best for her type of personality
or at least at this point
at this point i mean the little stuffed animals
she likes those
um the best
out of the ones that are here
yeah
does she have um favorite toys at home
uh yes she plays an awful lot at home with some stacker i don't know how to describe the stacker rings
and stacking cups that they come apart and they go together in different ways and different colors and she plays with them an awful lot
okay
does she have any um of this kitchen type like this play food or
no no we haven't got any for that for her yet
okay
and does she have any babydolls
such as
no she doesn't
and was she interested in that at all or is she
babydoll not at all
okay
not at all
now let's see does she
i think i before you were talking about animal names a little bit does that these types toys she looked at
right right right right
and do you do animals type of um i don't know games or books or
a little bit we have a couple boo we have a couple books with pictures of animals in them and they say you know it says uh like cow says moo you know those type of things uh
and she definitely like animals
and we have a couple of um these type of books that have like the feeling have the picture of the animal with it a little patch to feel
um so she's definitely more familiar with animals and we have a dog that she's very interested in
so animals are probably her favorite right now
oh okay
so do you think she might recognize some of the names of the animals here
uh she probably would recognize poohbear
um but i didn't show her the dog but she might recognize the the name of a dog
okay
right
um do you think she likes books or toys better
um
well today she prefers toys
uh but she right now she probably prefers toys overall but with books are like a supplement
yeah
do you do books at a particular time of day or do you just like
usually we do books uh before she eats or before bed
um so she might associate books with nighttime
which is possible
yeah
um
but yeah usually books are sort of on a routine
okay
so no dolls at home
unhunh
and no pretend food right
no
um
and we liked she liked some of these that she could hold right
right she likes the at home i do give her especially when i'm cooking um like measuring cups and spoons and to play with
so she she's familiar with this type of thing
ha you like these
yep
so you have those at home too
okay
i'd also like to play with your paper
oh i know
mom's gonna give you a magazine when you get home
yep
um i think
i asked you about her personality and things
do you think she
r oh out of those books which of them do you think she would prefer most to look at if she was going to pick between those
probably this caring cats book we have other caring cats books
so the colors and sort of um how she designs the kids
i think she'd be very familiar with
okay so that might be
yeah
is there anything else about the way she plays what she prefers that i didn't ask you
um no i mean it's a lot different here than at home
uh because her because honestly i put her on the mat an awful lot and she plays she's very independent she likes to really play by herself or play with the dog
um you know certainly i play with her and my husband does but she she really prefers just to play by herself
um
you know she she's just that way
okay
uh i guess she doesn't find us interesting when we play
yeah
so it was sort of beside the point having mom here huh
yeah she you could have came in and sat her down and she would've crawled over the toys or tried to
you know she she only wants us when they uh get away from her
to have help
yeah to have help to bring to bring them back to her
right well i think that's about all i had to ask you with this visit um
okay
okay
so i just have a few questions for you
okay
let's see
which of the toys did he seem the most interested in
why did you why did you think that was
he likes noisy
noisy toys
so this
okay
um if you had to pick a toy that you would say was good for his personality
what would you say
good for his personality
just about anything that makes noise
at this age i would say
okay
which toys did he seem the least interested in
he's not interested in in stuffed animals so far i think
the puppet was okay but this stuff
i mean he kinda touched everything else but
i'd say the stuffed animal
okay
would you say he prefers book over toys or book or toys over books
do you read at home
i do um and he's just getting into books so i'd say toys over books right now
okay
um do you have any of these toys at home
um i have something like this but
and the books but
not the food and stuff like that
okay
and do you think he recognizes names of any of these items
no
i don't think so
okay
um
i thought he might the bottle but he didn't seem to so
um what about i guess ke
not when i say it
do you ever play with pretend food at home
no
okay
let's see what else we have
what about animals
do you think he
see some kids are really into animals really early on and they recognize the names
does he seem
no i don't i don't think so
okay i think that's all we have
okay
so we can go and switch
and get 
yeah
all done
or okay
i can just ask you the questions now
okay
but if you er wanted to finish that
oh that's okay
yeah she likes to she likes to play by herself
and then she'll let me know when to kinda engage
so i will kinda say a little along the way
and then she's like okay
bored now
she communicates well
she does
she really does
good job
i'm always guessing what her brother wants
i have no idea
yeah she really she's our girl
good communicator
good job
okay well um i just have a few questions i wanted to ask you
okay
um and your microphone will pick it up so i don't really need to write
okay
lets see
which of these do you of these types of toys here do you think interested her the most
uh the stuff
she's not really into stuffed animals right now
and has about a five second attention span with books
she'll try to do it but
we're getting there
okay
so you and uh of these plastic toys what did she like the best you think
the bottle
the bottle and these measuring spoons
you like those
your fine
she's your friend
and what types of toys do you think are good for her personality
i know you said she's pretty different from her from her brother
um she likes she actually seems to like um more adult things
like she likes tape
she likes paper
she likes things like that
that are kinda tangible and anything i mess with she likes
reese will play with um actual baby toys and she will go for things that make noise or shine or anything like that
okay
so i don't have to get many toys for her
she likes the noise too
i see
so the wrappings always make noise
right
uhhum
okay and you said of these toys here um the stuffed animals interested her the least probably
probably
yeah i would say even less than books right now
okay
um does she have any stuffed animals at home
oh yeah
and does she is she interested at home
alright
um and then how about books
you said she wasnt she had about five seconds
she like she likes them though
and i can put them in her lap
and leave her with it
and she seems to look and kind of grab at the pictures
um she's pretty independent
so she likes to do that kind of stuff
doesn't like me to read to her
she doesn't like you to read to her
not very much
she would rather have the book and read herself
right
okay
that's what i was going to ask you next
yes
um do you think any of these items are things she would recognize the name of
um besides the bottle
yeah um probably probably not
she might recognize book
but um uh i don't think any of these are anything that she deals with on a regular basis otherwise
but bottle
okay um so do you feel like there are things here that she's never seen before
or never heard of before
some of these
yes
does she have any of the kitchen like uh plastic food or dishes or anything like that at home
yes
but she hasn't really played with it yet
okay
and um so does oh you said she does not play with the pretend food at home
and does she play with baby dolls do you have baby dolls at home
she doesn't unless there is something attached to the baby doll
like um intentional baby toy baby doll
she'll play with those
but just this kind of stuff
not yet
and alright is there anything else that i should know
um that you think would be good to know
about the way she plays or what she likes to play with
you gave me some good information about um the fact that she likes to play with the wrappings
and the paper and adult things
anything else you can think of
um she's she's not so interactive with me
but with her brothers
she really enjoys for a long period of time will play with her older brother whose three
and um he will just make noises and stuff and she really responds to noise and interaction like that
and um will a long long time
will list pay attention she doesn't pay attention for a long time
so so other that i can't think of anything that she other than what we discussed
that's notable huh
okay sayla
you did a great job
you made it kiddo
oh she did
never know what to expect with her
we need to get that off your eye
he can still play
hehe say great
hehe
great
i'm just gonna ask you a few questions
um what do you think she liked playing with the most
here
yeah
um probably the soft plush toys
either that or the books
but yeah probably probably the soft plush toys
do you have any of these at ho any of these toys at home
um nothing identical
nope
i mean we have soft toys
and we have books
are they animals
that are toys
are they
she has a little buddy
that she likes but it
looks
very different its not at all like that
do you think she prefers playing with books or toys
at home
um
she prefers playing with things she can put in her mouth
so i don't know if there is a big difference between books and toys
as long as it's roughly bite sized
okay
that makes sense
do you think she'd recognize the names of any of the things you played with today
i don't know
i don't think so
i mean maybe maybe she knows the word book
maybe
maybe
any of like the animal names or
i don't think so
body parts
i mean
i think sometimes she knows nose
and i think sometimes she knows feet
because we talk about noses and feet
a lot for some reason
um
and i think she knows the word for dog
but we didn't play with the dog
today but we have dogs at home
and i think she knows that one
do you ever play with baby dolls at home
no
i don't know why
we don't
or the pretend food i guess
she has a little picnic package at home
that's soft
it's like a picnic basket
and it has stuff to make a sandwich
like a chicken leg and a banana
she likes that cause she can chew on it
hehe
so i don't know if that falls into the fake food or the plush category
but it's it's definitely bite sized
okay
she
it's her primary requirement
alright um were there any is there anything here you thought she would like the least
no
i mean i didn't even try with the baby doll i guess
but
i don't know why
maybe cause she looks a little unhappy
when i open
but haha
what about the the books and toys
that you have around here
that um one that if you had to pick one that would
that she didn't like
yeah
the most disinterested lets say
um
maybe the zebra
and the goodnight moon
i mean it's it would be pretty arbitrary for me to say
yes she liked this no she didn't like that because
i think she pretty much enjoyed all of them
she loved the little caterpillar guy that you guys just gave her
she loved this
hehe
is it was that her prize
yeah
hehe
that's good
yeah
that's good
and then the books that you have at home cause i notice here you have a lot of you guys chose a lot of books here
um any of the similar like
we have
other books by this author
and we have other doctor seuss books
she's read goodnight moon
we don't have it at home but she sees it at her cousin's house
um
um
so and she has she has a farm animal book that's similar to this it's
not exactly the same but it's like touch and feel with farm animals
um
so yah she has she has similar books to
all of theses these
okay
so she's she's probably seen all different the animals in them
hey
okay well i think that that's it that was simple and easy hehe
easy enough
thank you so much for coming in
yeah
okay
so that's probably good um
so i just have a couple questions for you
i'm not gonna write anything down because you're miked and so we'll just go back write everything down
okay
okay so which of the toys seemed to interest her the most
the hard ones
yeah the food toys yeah
right
she's teething a lot
she has four teeth and she has two more coming in on the top
oh okay
um and i think just tactile wise she's much more interested in these right now than soft toys
we have both at home and she gravitates more to the harder things
okay
um
what do you think is a good toy for her personality
her personality
question
out of these
or just in general
um mostly out of these i guess
out of these
i don't know know what to
i mean
i think that's a kind of strange question
yeah
um like at home she likes to play like we have a lot of plastic toys like this like we have a kitchen with plastic play food that she really likes
and we also have this she has her sister just got this plastic doll house that she really likes
um she likes to have like a lot of different feelings and textures and
colors so i think that's probably
and like i said hard things you know
i don't know how that matches up with her personality like i feel like she's really inquisitive and busy
um
so i don't know how that relates but
okay
cool no that's good
um
what do you think seemed to the least
um probably the soft toys
she had looked at the books a little bit but like she's not
which is a good thing her sister is like obsessed with those right now
her sister's two so she steers clear of them and
oh okay
that works out well in our house
has she seen any of these books before
um a couple of these we have a lot of these kind of books at home
like the lift the flaps we don't have this one exactly
um
hers are mostly missing most of the flaps at this point
yeah
um but she likes she likes that kind of
peek a
yeah
um
and we have good night
she didn't look at that one though
we don't have these two which is why i brought those over to see if she'd check those out
and we don't have any of this exact food
no
a couple of the animals we have
okay
cool
um
let's see next question
um does she play with dolls at home at all
uh the little like little people dolls
like fisher price ones
um but she hasn't been too interested in bigger dolls like this
although she was interested in the baby today that's
yeah
it's funny the baby was like the same size as her
yeah
i was like oh my gosh she's in trouble
um
do you think that she would've recognized any of the food that she played with
she hasn't eaten any of that food i mean she's just really on um
like she'll eat toast
sometimes but she's like the solids that she's on are all still purees that i make her so
probably not
probably not
like when i was saying pizza she probably
or ice
um
no she hasn't really had that yet either her first she got some icing at her sister's birthday party yesterday and that was like her first sweet treat
so she hasn't she probably wouldn't and you know she's probably just putting it in her mouth because of the teething
yeah
um
okay at this point do you that think she'd recognizes any of the names of the items
um or is beginning to recognize the names of them
um
these are all most of these are new
foods
the ones that we played with
like pizza
um
so they're not items that she
probably would have in her vocabulary
oh
yet
um
or items i guess that she eats so
yeah
the baby she might know
yeah
yeah you know baby
you're a baby
you are a baby aren't you
okay so that's those are all the questions that i have to ask you
okay
oh i'm sorry the spoons
she definitely knows what the spoons are we have these in pink at home
oh the spoons yeah
and she plays with those
and she loves the spoons
and when i'm cooking that's how i get her to like
stay diverted for a few minutes with her spoons
really good tactic
yeah
there are your spoons
yeah you like the spoons
take when i pumped
okay i'm gonna ask you some questions then
okay
um you wanna stand up so she can't get your clipboard
um nope nope no you can't the my love yes
okay so what toys do you think she liked the most
she really liked the spaghetti especially since there were two and they matched
i don't if she had seen the the placemats she would have liked those too she's really into things being the same
see look ahhah two
see look at that
bang bang bang
do you have any like play food toys at home
um no not that she plays with
um we have lots of books
we have some stuffed animals but she mostly ignores them
her favorite toys are like puzzle toys and s like squish if you've heard of that
its kinda three dimensional sort of thing
um she likes putting things in and taking things out of her shape sorter
i mean she doesn't she has a really simple shape sorter that has an open thing in the front and then it has shapes on the sides
and she'll try to put things in the sides but she can't get but
um she likes her stacking rings
she likes anything she can bang
yes i know they're two and they're the same yay
isn't that cool
as you see she matches
does she have any of these books at home
yeah she has uh she has mister brown can moo
she has foot book
she has put me in the zoo
um do we have peeka baby
no we don't have peeka baby
we have other ones by the same author that look very similar but not peeka baby
um she has good night moon but not good night moon one two three
and she i don't think we have any touching books
does she have any of the stuffed animals
um none of those stuffed animals
i mean we have some but she mostly ignores them
she's not terribly interested in them
do you think she would recognize body parts
oh absolutely
hey well as you saw she grabbed the nose whenever i told you told her to grab the nose
delia
oh you're too busy banging
you're not gonna do it are you
she knows nose mouth eyes cheek um
sometimes she'll grab ear
sometimes she'll blow you off
um yeah she knows body parts
she knows hand um foot
i don't i don't think so
does she have any dolls at home
no as you saw that would terrify her
she was looking
i know it was a scary baby
its dead
who put that dead baby here
what did she like the most
that she likes this one now that she knows they're here
but um the spaghetti during the official time
she liked the spaghetti a lot
because like i said their are two they match so
and she could bang matching things together which is awesome
you find two things that match and you bang them together right
yes that's right
what would you say she liked the least
um the baby
i think abject terror was definitely dislike
do you think she likes books or toys the most
um it depends on what mood she's in
likes both a lot
um uh these things here she'd probably tire of most the things pretty quickly unless except for the matching stuff
um but uh yeah i mean i i she she crawls over to books any time she sees them
and pats them and then eats them but
she adores books
she'll she'll even like if if her uh older brother's being read to or if he's reading to her she'll sit in somebody's lap and just spaz out over the book so
what animals do you think she recognizes
no cause we never do that with her
i'm sure she doesn't
besides what sound does a deer make
that's right you found a fun toy didn't you
now that they've stopped officially counting
no they had two of them and you could bang them
does she have any of these toys at home
no no
any similar like texture or
um no we don't have any thing really like
we have colored plastic shapes and wooden and wooden shapes of all sorts
but we tend to go more for the geometric type toys then the replicating object type toys right now
because you know in general she's very shape focused so you know
um so we can
leave it
okay
um which toys did she seem to be interested in
the hard ones
oh the foods
yeah
um do you have any of these pretend foods at home or
no
um what about the which ones of these was she least interested in
the books
okay
um what about do you guys have any of the books at home or
we don't have any of these particular books
we do have books
alright um
does she have any of um does she have pretend dolls at home or stuffed animals
yeah we got a few of those
do you think she'd recognize any of the um foods we have
not yet
nah she's only eating purees right now
okay
um how the animals is there anything she recognized
she might've recognized pooh but other than that
okay
um so at home would you say she prefers books or toys
toys
toys
she chews on books occasionally but
oh
um okay i think that would be it unless there's anything you want to tell me about how she plays at home or if she has other toys
not really right now
pretty much anything she can get her mouth on she's fond of
okay
yeah
got plenty to to be interested in
yeah
good
um
well of the toys that we have here and the things we have here
keef
uh
what do you what would you say interested her the most
the play food
the play food
yeah
okay
by far
and do you think there is anything about her her personality
how she is that um that accounts for that or
um
not particularly
i think potentially it could be its
well i was gonna say browns not all that colorful
but it's um a kind of toy she's never seen before
we don't have any
um where as we have stuffed toys we have books
so
so this stuff she hasn't you don't have at home and the dishes the food any of that stuff you don't have at home
right
okay
that's definitely novel
got it
yeah
that is really interesting
and so
what do you think out of these things interested her the least
at least today
um
today
the books
today the books
yeah
okay
says it now been there done that ha
she has a lot of books at home
yeah
we do lots of reading and
playing and opening
and her dad has now taught her how to open books and
so
does she like to turn the pages turn pages by herself when you're reading to her or
um she's not quite there yet
but um
she does instead of just going whack whack whack with the books now
you know the one's that she knows
she'll open
kind of smile at
and sort of shake and flip open to another page
and smile at
okay
so she's
but she's not you know doing the pages as we read yet
she's kind of choosing the pace a little bit
yeah
okay
and of these here
do you have any at home that are ones she might recognize from home
um
as far as exactly the same no
i actually grabbed this book because we have a similar
like the same brand that has the you know ducks and
but um not the exact book
okay
haha cookie
you know what a cookie is already don't you
courtesy of daddy and mommy sorry
how about any of the other things
would she recognize uh any of the things she's seen here
does she have stuffed animals like any of these
um
she actually has a little duck that's almost similar characters
like colors as the frog
and same size
um
and she has a lot of little clothes and stuff with frogs
um
and there's the baby doll
you discovered the baby doll
you have about just as much hair as that
um
just looking around
oh oddly enough these these are like the best toy ever
on the um
highchair
and okay she would recognize that
yup she recognizes these
um
spoons cups
okay
um
would she recognize any of the food items do you think
um she's actually had little bits of bread
when pierce and i have had bread
um she'd probably recognize a hamburger
because we do cookout relatively frequently
um
pizza a lot if we are ordering in
um
i don't think she's actually seen us eat spaghetti
um
but the pretty red and white
and you were saying she doesn't eat peas like that
oh no she eatsum eats the mushy peas
so
but she loves peas
any like green
actually she's a big green veggie fan
which i hear is not normal for babies
so
going with the fact that she loves spinach
right
yeah
she does
um let's see
okay
so she likes to play with the um measuring spoon type stuff and things like
measuring spoons like baby food the plastic baby food containers
um
she actually really likes balls
um
squishy balls
since she likes you know we'll make stuff bounce
and just some stuff go crash
um she like to do that
um
we've lately started playing with stacking cups
and she's learned about knocking things over
but those are sort of the preferred toy right now
are the stacking cups
um and remote controls
cause a lot of times we have parents mention toys that are favorites at home
like balls
blocks or things
yeah
it's like the balls and the stacking cups right now
along with you know anything
pretty much anything that we touch
is what she wants
okay
um so
the telephone she actually has a little hissy fit
um whenever i pick up the phone i don't put it on speaker phone
she wants to she knows now that it's a conversation
maybe
or that mommy starts talking when she picks it up
and knows that it's not at her
so
and you want wires
and ice cream
she's seen ice cream
yeah
i don't think so
but yeah
she's definitely into the like picking out the most dangerous thing in the room stage right now
and how about you said she has a lot of things with frogs on them
does she know the names of any animals
do you think or
she heard
um
she probably knows like frog duck and cat
she definitely knows cats
um
and or specific cats names
do you have cats at home
yeah
okay
but she definitely
definitely knows the word cat
okay
oh aoife yucks
yeah that's really gross
i'm sorry
oh its fine
here
here baby baby
yucks
here lets do your face first
cause that can't feel very good
there ya go
and then dress
we will do mommys leg because it doesn't matter what i have on
good enough
and did she have any baby dolls at home
um just like one little squishy one
um
what she interested in that at all
no more than any other stuffed toy
okay
cause just here
at the end
she seemed a little bit interested in that dolls face
yeah
was one of those things
making me think that maybe we should pick up a baby doll
put it on the christmas list
it's coming soon
i know
okay
so she doesn't play with that so much
how much does she play with stuffed animals at home
not that frequently
they are more of like a crib
like when she wakes up in the morning
she has one that she likes to whack and choke um
but more mostly around the crib
or if i'm taking a shower
i'll plop her on the floor or do stuffed toys
actually that's stuffed toy and book time
so
so that's when she would
okay
yeah but if there's other things around
she'll usually pick up
she has this one little chicken that she likes
um
do we have one
yeah but like color wise you know
with the chicken it's color wise about the same
um but with the chicken she um
you know pick him up shake him and set him down
um pet him a little bit and that's it
like she's definitely more interested in the cups and
okay
things like that
little harder things
yeah
things that like honestly she's in a whacking phase right now
um so anything that she can whack
um and she's already starting to pick up like what makes good noise you know
to her good noises and a little more satisfying whack
yeah
that sounds about right
well that's all the questions i have
and if i didn't ask you anything about what she likes and doesn't
like and how she likes to play
um you can go ahead and let me know that
we will probably ask you very similar questions the next time
okay
and to see how she plays then
okay
yeah
so if you don't have anything to add then that's
just trying to think
aoife anything
noise
usually mommys a lot noisier
that's what a lot of parents this age
we do lots of
yup love noise and lots of singing
singing okay
yup
loves to sing
or loves to hear me sing and she'll actually sort of sing along
i didn't think you needed that on
for my voice anyway on uh
you do itsy bitsy spider huh aoife
oh fun
rubber ducky
yeah
maybe next time she'll wanna do
yeah we'll do some songs
alright that's great
okay
that's um i'll take that
woah
okay
i just have a few questions for you
i just need a tissue real quick
sure
oh
oh okay
thanks
you like those keys huh baby
thanks
you want this key don't ya
okay
so which of these toys seemed to interest him the most
um
he likes
the cup
and the plate
and the keys the most
okay
and why why do you think that is
cause
we've been practicing drinking from a cup
when i'm cooking or something at home
trying to keep him busy
i give him like a spoon or
some kitchen
plastic utensil to play with
something different to keep him
you know engaged
and then keys
um
i think just because they make a noise and he
he's into like shaking right now
okay
uh which of the toys seem to interest him the least
um
i think
the books
it's okay
and why you think that is
maybe cause they're hard and he likes
like textures
like grabbing and being able to
pick up stuff easily right now
okay
and uh
so i tried to show him a book
but he didn't
he liked the other stuff that he can hold
ha
um
woah
do you look at book at home
at all or
yes we do
is there any
like it does he have a favorite book or uh
um
not really
he doesn't really
pay too much attention
i know he's listening when i'm reading
cause
i read to him and his sister together
so i know he's listening
but he's not really
in into like looking at it or
touching the book yet
okay
so it could also be maybe
he sees enough at home like
you know he wants a new toy
i dunno
um do you think he recognizes the names of any of these
um
i think so
like
spoons and the cup and plate um
and the dog
we have a dog
okay
what about some of the food
the food
probably not he just started eating
okay
and there's nothing that he's eaten
okay
in here so
i don't think so ha
okay
do you have any of these toys at home
we do we have books
we have stuffed animals
dogs
um
cups
spoons
so
yeah
um
and does does do you ever play with pretend food
does his sister have any pretend food that
you guys play with
what's
um
we play with
not pretend food
really it's more like we pretend we have it in our hand like ah
ah but it's not any of this play stuff
okay
so we like
you wanna strawberry
and i give him one
and just like that
okay
but not anything to actually hold
okay
he seemed interested in the ice and the
yeah he yeah he did
cause he's never
he's never had it haha
okay
that i don't think he's seen
us or his sister
eat ice
so
okay
maybe just the shape
oh i guess these two
yeah the peas
okay
um does he play with dolls
dolls at home
his sister has lots of dolls so
he has
yeah he gets to play with dolls
okay
um
i think
that's all we have
for you today
yeah
you did really good
you did
you're hungry huh
haha yeah
you need some real food
right
haha
okay
actually don't need to write anything down
um
so
because i'm recording
it'll pick up my place
um
how did you feel how do you think she um this kind of compared to how you play at home usually
this is a lot more one on one time than she gets at home
okay
and who are you usually playing with um
nathan
yeah well i try to play with both of them but
he's a little more demanding
of the attention
okay
so she gets a little more attention now
ye
um does she have did you find that you play with similar things at home
oh we've got
a play
um
we've more tru at home
lot more trucks
she likes the trucks
um
we have books
we don't have a lot of stuffed animals
um
i think she has one
okay
um
are
did you say you have play
we do
have play
um but that's normally in the kitchen and we're we normally play in the living
so she really plays with a lot more trucks
she always
has a lot more trucks
are her brothers
yeah
trucks and building and things like that
well that's good
pieces of floor mat
uh
sorry
no you're fine you were absolutely fine this is actually
anything
um
the uh what do you think she recognizes the names at least or finds familar any of the names for some of the toys that
play
i don't think so
i do think so
cause you don't need any of this stuff yet
what would you play with from this pile that you that
we played with the spaghetti the waffles the peas
the cookies the pizza
the ice cones
and now she's just playing with the ju
uh i think that's about it
she got the box of peas
do you think she um i mean do you have those in your set do you have those in like
we have spaghetti
we have pizza
i do think i have ice
i don't think we have peas
i know we have cookies
so yeah
do you think that um she was kind of more familar with those or she just happened to
the color was what do you think attracted to her
i think she liked she's i don't know i think she likes to pick things up and stick in her mouth
do you like to pick things up and stick in your mouth
on our spaghetti the meatballs aren't attached
it's a separate piece
i always thought maybe maybe because it's not all white
ye
is our spaghetti all white
do you do you think she enjoys um reading books or playing
with toys more
she doesn't get a lot to read a lot of books
so i think she likes playing with the toys more
okay
with nathan you know
everyday we read books
with her not so much
yeah
we just
don't hold still long enough to read books
we just don't hold still
do you think she enjoyed it today
i think so
hopefully
she didn't pay much attention to me reading the book
okay
she was too busy playing with the toys
okay how about um other games that you might play like um earlier you had been playing um like chase or something but
or like pattycake or even what like the book you were playing with the book earlier
the peekaboo
we don't play any of those
okay
she just doesn't i feel bad but you're like doing your study like first kid second kid
i mean no it's absolutely trust me that's not anything
don't feel bad
we ju we bounce we uh she loves to stand up
ye
light ye
do you think she recognizes did you play with any stuffed animals today
i tri to
i showed her i showed her everything but uh
she picked up the eagle and that was about it
okay
um
anything
but i showed her everything
anything familar from that child
or home or just a name or
nah
no unless it's mickey mouse
nathan's really into mickey mouse so
of course her face lights up as soon as mickey comes on the tv
yes
was she into um
she liked the clo i think cause she could pick it up and it was big
did you like this
it's got a face on it too
ye
what do you think she liked the most today
it seems like she loves the spaghetti
do you like the spaghetti
and uh what do you think she
liked the least
probably the stuffed animals
we at least made it through a book
you know
i would have to
say the stuffed animals was the least
you're really a toy company aren't you
yeah that would be good that would be good
i'm sure we would all get paid a little bit more
i'm sure you would
what working for hours and hours and hours for no money isn't fun
do you
we have keys at home too so
you like them
you like them
do you have baby or anything similar to
we do have a baby
um that my mom got for nathan to get ready for
but um it's never really played with
it has a rattle in the head so we do rattle it's head someti
okay
but um
it's just not not a favorite
okay so today wasn't
this is nothing abnormal
we have more battery operated toys i guess at home too
so you know there's lights and whistles and stuff
and how does she play with block is it
she picks em up and puts em in her mouth
pretty much
it's her thing right
that's her thing
she's orally fixated
and discovering the world ri
are you orally fixated
ye
was there anything else you thought
she was really interested in or really opposed to that was
interesting today
i think that she no
i don't know
i think that she liked to chew on things
do you like to chew on things
that's what i think
i think you like to chew on things
and it really doesn't matter what it is
exactly she's happy
she's much happier than her brother
that's good
are you a happy baby
okay well then that's
anything else
all
to ask you some questions
yeah you can keep playing
you like the spoons i can tell
besides the spoons what else do you think she was interested in
well she was interested in these plates um at first
i guess i don't know why the color or the shape maybe
but then once she had the spoons that's about it
yeah
uh she really didn't you know if i if i showed her something she'd be distracted for a second
but she really i guess likes these the noise they make or something
i guess she likes things that make noise
does she play with anything else that makes noise
uh she had the keys for a little bit and was shaking 
but um when she discovered the spoon she seemed to like them best of all
and you think its just of the noise probably
well she she seemed to have liked to grab the big one
i think it was easy to hold she would and she would just shake it around
i think she liked shaking it around
she she would drop and she would you know she'd have the big one and then she'd switch to having all the little ones
and then switch back to having the big one
it was interesting
we don't play with measuring spoons at home maybe we'll have to get you some huh
yeah i was gonna ask you if she played with anything similar to these
well we have measuring spoons when she cooks with when we cook in the kitchen
we'll give her like a spoon or a cup we don't give her you know all of them together so no
do you think she would recognize something like that do the single ones you give her are they anything like these
um
are you talking about just like a regular spoon
no we give her measure she had a measuring spoon and a measuring cup the other day
so she might recognize them
i mean they're white
they're similar shape
but we've never given her like a group of them connected
they could also be similar to like you know keys that she tries to take from us that i don't let her have
like car keys and stuff
okay so she's seen keys
yeah
but she didn't want these she wanted these
that's interesting
you like those
did she um play with any of the other food or
she she picked up a plate she pi she was rolling this around for a little bit
trying to um
and she picked up this as well for a little bit
and the cheese for a little bit
bef um she's and then just a second ago she had the slice of pizza
she's just i noticed she likes um she tends to like to pick up flatt flatter things
i think they're easier for her to hold
when she tried to pick this up she had more of a problem with it
did she uh show any interest in any of the books
um i tried to show her a book and she pushed it away
she was like i wanna play with the keys
stop distracting me
no books this time
no book this time
how about any of those stuffed animals
no i tried to attract her attention with the frog
and the dog and even the puppet
moving it around and having it talk to her kiss her and she would look at it but then she went straight back to the key the the um measuring spoons
and how about the baby doll
she smiled at it and l um but she didn't really um she wanted to play with the spoons
but she looked at it
she did she looked at it she smiled at it
she even made like a little noise but then she went back to spoons
so out of all these things obviously the measuring spoons were the favorite what about the n if those weren't there what would you say would guess would be the most interesting for her based on her personality or what you see at home
um anything that can she make make noise
she likes to shake things like rattles and and things like that
but if it wasn't the measuring spoons she probably would have played with the keys more
if both of those were gone i would imagine she would have well when i first set her down in the middle she went straight for the pile of of food
probably would have just spent her time picking those up and banging them together and and um picking up different ones passing back and forth between her hands
does she bang other things together at home
yes
we don't have blocks here sometimes moms will stack these does she have any blocks at home
no she doesn't not yet
yeah that's hard to pick up
yeah she just can't seem to get that very well yet
does she like books at home at any particular time
we read stories before her nap and bedtime so you know after playtime's done
i don't have the books out i guess at the same time as her toys
and then does she have any favorites that you look at at home
she likes the the ones that she can touch
that's i bought this out at first but she wasn't interested
she likes to be able to um touch the feely books while we read them
okay let's see what would you say interested her the very least
um today
the books
she wasn't interested in having me read to her she wanted to play
okay and at home do you think she prefers books or toys
um probably toys
um i mean she we have like a set story time
story times during the day before each of her naps and at bedtime we'll read to her three books
but she's kinda settled down
but she smiles like when i you know get her changed and everything in her jammies and we'll get the books she'll smile at them
so she likes to hear the stories she likes to likes to look at the pictures
um i guess it's part of the routine
right right and she enjoys that
okay does she have any dolls at home
she has one doll we just got it for her like two days ago a baby a little squishy baby doll
okay and how any stuffed animals at home
we do have some but she really doesn't play with them a lot she mostly wants to chew on them and they get all gross
right that's understandable
without an older sibling i find that most of the time infants her age don't have play food
we don't have play food at home
okay
not yet
not yet
not yet i think that might be all the questions
and i guess do you think there are any of the items here that you think that she would recognize the names of at this point
um maybe baby
um maybe book
that's probably maybe keys that's probably about it
okay that's great uh that's all i need to ask
you can keep playing if you like
um what do you think uh she was most interested in today
i think anything she can chew
like the soft food toys
um she liked and she does like stuffed animals
mkay
so those two things i think would be
is that similar to how she plays at home
yeah
she's teething right now so anything that she can put in her mouth
okay
you agree
uh do you have the pretend food at home
i don't have the pretend fru food yet but obviously we'll be getting some
do you play with the stuffed animals at home
yeah she has a lot of stuffed animals and we have a bunch of poohbears which is why i thought she'd go for this but um yeah we have a ton of stuffed animals and she always goes for them
which animals does she have at home
she's got um a lot of those um
the brand is the lamaze toys
okay
so
do you think she recognized the names of any of the animal the stuffed animals she played with today
i don't think so
no
no i don't think so
at home the toy one toy we do have is a balloon and that's the one thing she will recognize if you say balloon she will turn in the house and look for it
oh
so
that's the one she knows
uh what about the foods like um do think she recognize er you know has heard around the house or maybe any of the names names
the peas
peas
that one i think she knows we always used that was her first food
and that's the one she
you would eat all the time so we'd always we even bought a book about peas
for her and we'd always just say peas please
right
would you like some peas please
so that one i thought maybe she might
any other foods that she played with that you thought
that she would know the names or
um i don't think so you know
we haven't really
yeah
haven't really introduced her to um she still like eats baby food and formula so
but she has had ice
how the books
did you
did she
she has the regular good night book at home um and we read her all the doctor seuss books so
that one but yeah this one
i don't think she recognizes the or them but we do read her
to her
does she like to play with books more than toys or toys more than books
well right now with the books it's more like especially the board books she puts it right in her mouth so it probably doesn't matter what as long as she can put it in her mouth
yeah
but
but she does enjoy the
but she does at nighttime she sits um my husband sits in a chair with her and they read
and she'll just sit you know right before she goes to bed
okay
so
that's nice
yeah that's their little thing
right
do you think today uh here she showed more interest in the toys or the books
i think today was more into the toys
okay
um
yeah
and at home with
you are so much happier here than the first part
good way to end on this
um and so at home what does she gen you sa what does she usually play with like her favorite toys at home
um we have tons of teething stuff around the house
um and the any toy that like
well she liked this bee by the way too because of his um hair
but anything that she can um the toys we have all like crinklies and um
anything with lights
and noises she has a huge doggie um stuffed toy that has like you know everytime you press something it says oh this is his foot and sings a song
so she likes anything with lights and noise
that's cute
right
and you i know i saw that you forgot about him huh
yeah
you like mister bee
does she have any dolls at home
she has um
yeah she has but they're like soft dolls
yeah
nothing like this but
yeah
just like the you know they'll be like this but a doll looking
and do you call it a doll
i do
i say it's her babydoll
does she just uh play with it like the way she plays with other stuffed animals
yeah
exactly the same
yeah she is liking that
yeah i know
before i pulled it away and she had like one piece that she was just holding in her mouth
and the spoon huh
do you think she knows the name are you using you're using a spoon or
yeah what i don't know if she knows the names of things
yeah
the balloon and her name are like the two things that we just kind of recognized ourselves
that she knew like
like if you said the balloon or say her name she would turn
in the direction of the you know us or the balloon in the house
so those are the only two things that i know of
right now
would you like a spoon
is the what do you think think she least sorry liked the least
um
i don't know
i don't know
i mean she doesn't you know she's not attentive to listen to a book
long enough but i mean i don't
that's too bad we're still doing that
right
um i don't know i think she liked it all
she was very happy here
oh really
that's good
there wasn't anything that you tried to introduce that she was like um this isn't happening for me right now
no i don't think so
you know some she was more like she definitely had a preference for like this stuffed animal versus this stuffed animal
okay
you know but i think it's because of his hair
she likes it see
well she picked up the um
she picked up the other one the
she did pick up the frog she actually moved to get the frog
so he was back here and she did move to get him
why do you think that is
i don't know if the color
maybe
i don't know
so she likes something yeah
she went right over the other one
yeah
she
i'll just use you to
you're just gonna help me get to my frog
right
what is that
you got a little monster in you huh
right
um
so let's see
um
which which toy do you think
um which toy do you think he liked the most
i think he liked the book the most haha
i mean in his definition of toy heehee
yeah
uh any reason why you think
u
i just think it eem because it does more
i mean if you think if it other than a book you know
it has more parts to it
and they mo and each you know they're different colors on each part
yeah
uh it might taste pretty good too
i dunno
heehee
d you have books like this at home
um we do
but he hasn't really seen too much of them
um they're just uh going through boxes and going okay what should we hall back up
you know from his sister back up into his space
so he's just beginning to
like last week we really started with the three dimensional toys and things that he could put in little boxes
and take out and rattle around
so um
would you say he prefers books or like toys
um well he has more experience with little blocks and things of toys
than he does playing with a book
he's only done this once before
so it might be a novelty to him you know
seeing it again today
um
so which title does he have there
the foot book
o okay
do you guys have that one at home or
we don't have that one at home
no
okay do you guys have doctor seuss at home
we have yeh we have lots of doctor seuss at home
uh do you remember any of the titles
let's see um
hop on pop
which his his sister took literally then after we bought the book
heehee
um one fish two fish red fish blue fish
cat in the ha
um horton hears a who
a space b a book about space
um i think we have about eight eight different titles
okay um so you said he plays with blocks and
he plays with um he plays with blocks
and he plays with you know cups and
he doesn't put the blocks in the cups
but he takes the blocks out of the cups
um and um i mean regardless of what it is everything winds up in his mouth um
and yeh
heehee
yeh put it through the taste tester
yeh
um and he's been playing with um he likes stuffed animals
little fuzzy stuffed animals
okay
um but i think he's mostly playing with blocks and boxes and things like this that you can grab and diff things
that make noise or have a little reflective quality to it
okay
so you mentioned stuffed animals
we
you know he didn't really play with any today but
yeah i mean i didn't even thing ab
you kno i just sort of
uh i guess my focus got here
yeah um
does he have any of those animals at home
he ha he has a winnie the pooh that's a little larger
uh and then of course he plays with his sister's animals of which he has i think she has the whole animal kingdom in her room um
haha
and he likes he also sometimes sleeps with one
like he puts it against his face
aw
with the little fuzziness
do you think he recognizes the names of any of those animals
u we could try
i have not i have not
i mean he has a panda so
i'll say oh you know where is your panda bear
but
i have i
but sort of like almost as if i'm talking out loud because i'm trying to pack the diaper back heehee
you know not like here's your panda bear pet
you know i have i
haha
so he's heard panda bear and beneficial bug
i'm not sure if he'll be able to pick up that
haha
haha
d he's got one that's a little bug
and has teething rings on it
and little things that crackle and stuff but um
so any of these food toys
does he have any of them at home
do you guys play with any of them
no
we don't have any food toys at home
do you think um like if he sees food around the house or different like utensils
do you think he might recognize anything
he um he he tries to use a spoon
uh we're we're feeding him solid food sometimes
about two meals a day
so he will he he wants his own spoon when when we do that
um he grabs at uh bowls
and other utensils if he can and glasses um
he watches intently when we're eating
okay
you know and he like sees it on the plate and then he rides it back up to your mouth
you know heehee
like this back and forth
uh
you liked that toy didn't you
ye
what is that
a key
oh okay
did he play he played with the keys for a bit right
yeh
he played with the keys
and he played with that li dish
and the book
so um which toys do you think in general what kinds would interest him the least
um
is that good pizza
heehee and a whole pie
for for playing like for minute to minutes at a time right now i th say it would be stuffed animals
because he likes but he he likes them mostly for for calming down as opposed to interacting with 
unless they have some chewy things on them
okay
he's teething
and that's what he mainly uses his panda bear for
is to d little hard knobs on it and stuff
um that's not a straight stuffed animal
um he doesn't seem to be attracted too much to like the faces of stuffed animals you know
like and be intent on them um it's
mo it seems to be more a tactile sensation than
okay
you know here's a little thing i can i can
a little character i can play with
okay
so in terms of dolls or things that um
dolls
so far he hasn't
a do well little dolls yeah he's had
he's he's played with little dolls
um he's played with little um um little animals not stuffed animals
but little wooden or plastic animals but still
he'll you know he'll he'll drop them to the side and he you know he wont he wont bother looking for them again
whereas he'll drop a block or a cup to the side and he'll
look for it
he'll look for it or he'll complain you know
like he'll start to cry that it's no out of his reach
and then i'll move it back in his reach
and you know he'll be content again
until he it's out of his reach
um inadimate objects
i guess
haha
haha
so far what's
should i be worried visit
um and balls
okay
something he can squeeze
and stuff like that
yeh and move around
do you um when you're playing with him do you like name things like if you're playing with animals or if you're playing with
um i do
i guess um in this stage i've more just been um seeing what he does with it
um i guess i've been more into you know yes i know this is a depiction of a slice of you know bread
um but i'm just sort of letting him just see whatever he wants in it
you know he could be attracted to the color
it doesn't have to be a piece of bread for him at this point
i'm thinking it just if he likes the texture of it or if he likes the coloration or something
but i haven't really gone out of my way to say you know what it is
okay
aw
um
well could we
are you tired of sitting
would you like to
aw we're getting tired
you guys did an excellent job
yeah
what's some of the stuff recording so we can get the i ds
i think
a did you guys pick out a toy already
yeah it's our little tr pyramid thing triangle thing
oh yeh
i don't mind at all
um so what do you think uh that amara was like the most interested in today
she played with the stuffed animals for a little bit but the play food
why do you think that is
my child likes to eat
she definitely has an appetite i don't know i don't know if it's just the way that they feel curiosity
um do you think that she recognized any of the names of the foods that she played with
i don't think so yeah
yeah cause just pretty much the only thing she gets to eat it i mean she'll get like little things from a lots of fruits
bread and stuff but
not but i mean i will never get her spaghetti or meats or anything else at this age i mean she definitely recognized the bottle
okay and then the um but everything else like probably not so familiar
not yet no not i mean when she right now like what i do when i give her her fruit is i try and you know say the name and
just so she gets the you know gets familiar with the name of it but nothing that she played with over here is something that i would've given her i guess the peas maybe
all right and um how about the animals
she played a little bit with the animals she has a lot of like i mean she has a lot of soft toys at home
um but she'll play with
and she's not i mean she won't play with toys for a long amount of time i mean especially now that she's moving its she'll look at it play with it put it in her mouth and she's off to the next thing
were there any animals that you think do you have these animals at home
so she has ums she has a lot of the you know like stuffed animals but not necessarily any of these
okay um i think you played with which ones
the zebra for a little while
okay the zebra
the zebra and the frog
does she have those two at home is that
no i just pulled them out of the pile
all right
um what toys do you think interested amara the least
um
the doll itself and the books
okay do you play with dolls at home
no dolls
i mean she has two that someone made her that you know she'll put in her mouth and that's it but pretty much not like no doll play yet
okay all right um i thought you had i thought i thought you had mentioned i don't know i thought it was the booties
yeah she had taken off her shoes a couple of times
okay
to put in her mouth
all right do you think she that when you were talking about the shoes and she recognized that at least as a pair of items or
honestly no probably not because i don't put shoes on her yet
okay no that's you know
no i try not to put shoes on her yet and since its been warm i didn't have to cover up her feet
that's great the more you get away with it the better um
so i guess were there any toys that you have at home that
um
she's got like little ca you know like little stuffed cow she's got
um
she's got these two little dolls but she doesn't play with them play with them so much as
throw em you know like wrestle with them throw them around
i guess it doesn't have anything that's close to what she has
like you know she has the key the rings with the keys and stuff like that like things that she can put in her mouth and chew on cause of the teething
um
she has tons of the books
but she'll you know like will sit through and flip through and read a couple of pages and then she's off to the next thing
but nothing that she'll let me sit and go through a book with her
um so you don't have the pretend foods that we had here
not yet no
might be a hit
ye it might be i hadn't even thought about it yet i figured it was way to early for her to have
um and then was it different um how you um are there different activities that you might do at home
at home it's less with the toys and more with each other i think
like rolling around in a fi throwing her in the air bouncing her around
so i don't think yeah we don't really play with like i'll give her toys if you know i want her to entertain herself or something like that but otherwise when we're interacting it's more playing games with each other
okay do you have what kind of games do you play
you know she'll like wont not like i don't want to say wrestle but like pretend wrestle you know like i said the bouncing around the tickling the kissing her
um st like ye like more interactive stuff
do you do like song singing and
dancing
she does songs and dancing with her dad
that's nice that's very sweet
um and then as far as the books did you happen to notice any books
we have the doctor seuss ones um
and then ye the doctor seuss and then i have a ton of baby einstein books at home
but they're all the hard cover and i have a ton of the little hard cover books
ye
you know
well that's good well thank you very much i think that's i think that's it
thank you
it would be helpful if you could just tell me what you felt like he liked best
he likes the plastic toys the best so far
ah
so he likes this thing
s i think of maybe the feel or the sound they make
but he's really liking the keys
say
we have keys at home but these are more fun
mainly the plates and the the keys
and now the ice
are they also um toy keys that you have at home
yes
okay
they're much bigger though
that's the only difference
so maybe that's why he likes them
so he's really going for those a lot
he is yes
a easy to hold
hah and now you found the blocks
so you think they're easy to hold and maybe they make a noise
ma i he likes things that make noises
rattles and things like that
don't ya don't you
yeah
yeah
he looks busy
um
he's usually interrupted
so this is one of the few times he hasn't been interrupted by big sister
ahhah
yeah
hah spoon
yay
um so out of these toys here what do you think is the best for his kinda personality
for his personality
um h right now he likes things that he can grab
like these things
we have a lot these he gone toward
he has balls that he chases at home
but he can't really go very far with 
so they sometimes frustrate him
but right now um smaller things that he can pick up with his hands
um
you said these kinds of things is because of the rattle part of it or what
the sounds
the sounds they make
oh okay
so these are nice but he likes things that make sounds
so not so much these
at least for him
yeah your sister liked stuffed animals didn't she
let's see um
what do ya think interests him the least of the stuff we have here
right now um the books
just because he we have a set time during the day that we read them
i think
so he's used to reading them before nap and before bed
and so i guess his regular play toys he doesn't get them that often
but
yeah
if so let's say it is bedtime or whatever of the books that we have here what do you think would be best for him
well right now with us we like the touch and things
and then we've also been reading the small doctor seuss stuff
a lot at home
mainly because we've already had them so
um things that are short
and rhyme
he's doesn't have a preference for that but we tend to read ones that rhyme because that's what his sister liked
don't we yeah
so we've read the abcs and the foot book
and the eye book
short ones
short
ones that rhyme
yeah
or you said um
or feel just because he can we let him play with it more
right
see
the ducks
the ducks
and you want the toy
mommy let you put that in your mouth
i heard you doing some animal stuff
does he um do you read books about animals
or do animal type stuff
yes
um mostly books
so we do a few songs
like we do itsy bitsy spider
things like that
mainly just your standard nursery rhyme type ones
so and he gets a lot of that influence mainly because of his sister
i bet
he's getting a lot of fun learning just by
yeah
things that i didn't think of to do for her when she was this age
do you think that there are any of these items that he would recognize the name of
any of these toys
no probably not at this point
do you have toys like
you said stuffed animals
we have stuffed animals
how about the baby dolls
we have the dolls
and so far no interest
okay
how about the play food kitchen type things
um he likes to play with the stuff
i don't know if he actually recognizes it for what it is
but he likes to play with it
so your daughter must have
oh yeah lots
he has access to that
oh yeah
okay so you you don't think he would recognize any of that these food
i mean i realize they don't all look really that much like food but
um d you think he would recognize any of these food items here
probably not only becau
well and part of that is is because he's not taking to food right now
um he hasn't liked solid food at all except for just toast and crackers
that's it
so we can't get him to eat any food other than that
where you going
you said no interest in dolls right
not yet
he could but
they're they're available but he hasn't shown any interest
no
okay
but he doesn't have total access to it since he's not crawling yet
so once he crawls he could change
yes
that's very interesting
yeah
um alright that's all my questions
yeah
d you are there any things that i didn't ask that you feel like would be helpful in terms of what he likes and what he how he plays
anything like that
um a lot of his play is with his sister almost all of it
so a lot of is like the interaction with her things that she shows him
um mainly because she takes over for me haha
she she insists on doing it
things like that so
most of it's just all with his sister
okay
so whatever she shows him and and then he's probably interested
yeah
and then he does and then otherwise he does like his play on his own
like when i'm putting her to sleep he'll be playing with his toys in his crib and
so
and then it's usually um he does have a couple of stuffed animals that he plays with
so one's a big monkey and
ah then the other ones are all ones that make noise
okay
great
okay
so which of the toys did he seem to be the most interested in
um the peas
okay
um why do you think why do you think that is
he tried to put it in his mouth
okay
if you have to pick a toy that you would say is good for his personality what would you pick
good for his personality
um
and why
well uh
i mean
i don't know
that's that's an interesting question
i didn't really think about it
um
i'd say he's least interested in the book
although with my first son he would love to be read to at this age
and he will a little bit
like he tolerated a few pages but
so that's the least like him
i um
i think he liked uh i think he liked making sound from the from the plastic pieces by tapping them together
so i think that was something he could do something with
okay
you know the book and the animal they're kind of they don't really do anything
so that's why i think he he was like wanting to do something
okay
um which of the toys did he seem to be the least interested in and why
uh i think the book or the zebra
um
okay
just they like you said they don't make
they don't make a sound or they don't they're kind of you know they're there
i don't know if he if he understands that me reading the book is
do you know what i mean
like if that's if that's what i'm doing
i don't know if he gets that
okay
do you think does he have a certain type of book that he prefers for you to read
no
i mean we have we have that one at home for example
and we have something similar
we have a lot of these we have a lot of of baby books like board books
he just doesn't seem that into it at this point
um do you think there's any of these items that he recognizes the name for
i kind of doubt it
although we ha
maybe book
but i i don't know
i kinda
i don't know
that's a good question
what about some of the eating utensils
um the spoon he might
but that's not the kind of spoon that he he's fed with
um we do have play dishes at home
um he mi
i'm trying to look at the animals
he might recognize an animal name
but um uh maybe not with those animals they're kinda specific
maybe frog
i don't know
okay
um do you have any of these toys at home
you mentioned the book
we have books
we have play dishes
i haven't usually let him play with the play dishes per se
but he plays with things that are like um similar
he has he ha
and right now he's he's cutting teeth
so like
hello
things that he can chew on i think he prefers just now beca
um but he has uh he he he has a little a little keyboard that he likes to play
he has um uh you know sort of those those um uh
i don't know what you call 
like they're like cloth teethers that have the sort of
like the the legs and stuff on them have like a plastic piece or a rattle piece or whatever
so there's he has different ones of those that he likes
does he ever play with dolls
um i don't think we have a doll
we ha um
we have like the soft blocks
and we have those big the big fat you know like the duplo type blocks
and we have things that um we have stuffed anim stuffed animals and things like that
but i'm trying to think if he actually has a doll
i don't think he actually has a a quote unquote like baby doll
i don't think he has one at this point
okay
okay i think we are done for today
okay
oh i was gonna say it's not a it's not a it's not a bias thing in the sense of
oh no no
you know
i would let him play with a doll if he shows an interest in it
i don't care about that
you're a hungry girl huh
you're a hungry girl
are you guys
oh sure
so what do you think her favorite thing was here today
um i think she liked the bread
and the waffles
um i think shh you know the the toy food
that was that was neat
we don't have that at home
anything that she can easily grasp and put in her mouth is is a favorite i think
but i think she definitely liked those
okay
do you think she um any of the names for the food were familiar to her
um probably not
um because we're still you know she's just starting her solid foods um so she's limited in in um what she's eaten um
you know where she's in her cereals and uh just started you know she has a couple vegetables and a couple fruits
um but nothing you know she's it's still me feeding her it's not something she hasn't started self feeding with crackers or cookies or or you know breads anything like that yet
okay
okay what were some of the foods that she
oh you said the the waffles and the bread
was there anything else that
um i think the cheese and um the mystery meat here
maybe bologna
um and the waffle the spaghetti she grabbed
the the pizza
yeah
the plate she liked
yeah
did she um did she play with any of the other things here
um she went to go for the book
um she likes to chew on her board books at home
um so she did go for that to chew on that but i think that the bread then got her attention and she um went back for the bread
okay
do you thi um does she generally at home play does she like to play with more books or toys
um it depends
it depends on you know uh kinda her mood
she has a
you okay honey
she has um uh like a pail that has blocks in it the different shaped blocks and you know it has a lid to it that has the different cutout shapes and you're supposed to put in um the shapes
she doesn't do that she likes to just dump the blocks out and chew on you know the blocks and the lid and the box
um so she'll play with that at home
and she likes um she has a a book that's like it uh has like a fabric cover and uh a re um uh a handle so it's like a purse book
and she loves it because she can hold on to the the handle um and she can chew on it and we read it and so um she's kinda it's a mix of what she you know what she'll play with at home
and today do you feel like she was more into the toys or the books
um i would say the toys today
okay
did you which books did you read
um we read on the and peek a
i think she liked the peek a book
do you play like patty cake and
um we try we sing a lot
um we sing a lot
and uh she just recently within the past like two weeks um started sitting up on her own
um i guess was was more stable on her own so we're able to play more face to face than usually it was me you know her in my lap and so she saw i guess you know my hands and we would play but now she can see you know my face and things which is
oh my
which is new
cooler
yeah
and um do you play peekaboo at home
yes
you do
yes we do play peekaboo
um she doesn't you know reciprocate with covering her face yet um but she loves it when we when play at home
how with um babydolls
um she has um not a babydoll like this it's more of um a cloth baby and it's small
and she likes it she likes to chew on the feet and and things uh
but uh but yeah no shh we do have a babydoll at home
she is rolling around
and some stuffed animals
oh my goodness
she is very happy
yes
yes she is
how the uh stuffed animals did you guys play with that today
um we did a little bit
she um didn't init i think she was more interested in um the the the bread and the the waffle things that she could actually hold and really chew on and i think she's starting to get some teeth so i think anything that you know she can put in her mouth um is good
uh do you think um do you think any of the animal names are familiar between and the book
um we talk a lot about ducks
um she has a couple like toy ducks
um and horses
i mean we sing you know old mcdonald
um we talk about our different we sing uh there was
so fly bird spider um cow dog cat
uh she you know she hear those
i don't know if she's made any associations um you know with that
but she you know she hears the words
and um uh i forgot what i was going to ask as a follow up to that question but
oh no no problem
oh the songs that you play
uh huh
you said you do a lot of songs
yeah we do
we sing a lot um we sing a lot with like especially in the car it helps i think soothe her
um but we sing a lot
um goodness uh the wheels
um itsy bitsy
the ants
um uh old mcdonald
uh bumble bee song is one of her favorites i think
um there was um
we sing rubber ducky
and baby bulluga
bath time
and under the
and i think those are the big ones
i try to switch it up
that is uh impressive
oh thank you
yeah we like our songs don't we
we like our songs
yeah
we learn new ones at the library don't we
so
so today what do you think that she really was not the least favorite
um i think i think the stuffed animals were she just wasn't um you know not that she didn't like them but i think just weren't her favorite i really think she liked the toy food
didn't you
i think you liked the toy food a lot
and the books weren't too bad either huh
why do you think that is that the animals
um i just think that it's um she couldn't chew on 
you know they don't have the same feel in her mouth
you want a cookie
you want a cookie
does she get crackers or cookies at home
um no not yet
we just started um the little like um like cheerio type o
um just started those yesterday
and um she likes to she can grab um and she can get it in her hand and sometimes she'll get it she'll get in her fingers
um but i don't know if she just didn't like the taste of 
um she kinda made a face when she got it to her mouth
but she tries to get it
and like they're you know they they fall or they stick to her hand so she's she's learnin
um how to eat those but i haven't given her any crackers or cookies yet
okay
um so i'm not sure how she would do with those
they're on the list to start
yeah
one by one
yeah
well i'm so glad that she's loving it here
oh yeah no thank you we are too
okay so that's that's it for the battery of questions
okay great
okay hah um let's see
which toys do you think he seemed the most interested in
he seems the plastic ones with the books
okay um why do you think they interest him
i don't maybe because they are shiny or he can chew on his he was chewing on them in his mouth
okay um what about which was he least interested in
he wasn't interested in any of the stuffed animals
yeah they don't really do anything
um hah um do you have any of the play foods at home
um yes his sister does
um but he doesn't really play with them at home
do you think
you going to stand up
is he standing yet or
yeah that's what he he i think he would rather walk around then play with toys
there you go
hi
okay so we'll move on
haha yeah
okay um i guess we can
um okay you said
are there any foods you think he would recognize
um i don't think i mean i don't know he's seen us eat pizza he's seen us eat a cookie
i don't know if he recognizes them as food or
just as something plastic to put in his mouth
hey buddy this way
okay um you said he liked the books
do you have any of these
books
um not the particular uh titles but we have similar sizes and stuff and um he he's at home he is more interested in trying to eat them than actually read them
okay um what about are there any dolls or
yeah his sister has lots of dolls at home
okay does he like the baby at all
um yeah i think he went over there to see what was going on but i don't think he was particularly
interested
what about do you think he might recognize any animals
um i don't i mean he wasn't interested in any of them
we do have a winnie the pooh at home
he wasn't interested in that
i don't think he recognizes any of them as animals right now
okay um that's it
um is there anything else you want to tell us about
what he plays at home
favorite toys or anything
um right now his favorite thing is he wants to um walk around
so either walk around the furniture or we have a gated off area
he walks around the play gate
um and he likes the things that you spin and it makes noise
those are his favorites
like he has a uh a train that will spin and a car that has a little thing on it that spins and makes the noise
alright i think we are all done
she can play just keep playing over here
okay
it's hard to play with people watchin
yeah sure is
but by the time your third visit won't even notice
they get familiar
they kind of remember the set up and the toys are the same
oh
a little bit overwhelmed
we like to see what
yeah
overtime what they like
what changes or the way the play with toys and how it changes it's kind of interesting
cool
but as far as today's visit what did you feel that she liked was attracted to most
um these things i think that resemble boobs
i guess the
you don't think she thought it was food
um i dunno i mean i don't think i've ever given her anything that looked like that
but she likes hard plastic stuff at the moment
okay
so did she like any of the other plastic things
um no she fixated on the peas and the pastas i guess
spaghetti
yeah
hard plastic
nice texture on the gums i guess
now you've got this
yeah
so she liked to put stuff in her mouth right now
yep
and this stuff
so do you feel like that's the reason that she's attracted to that kind of stuff it's
yeah
i think because i think these things felt good
and she chewed on them
but it's hard plastic
shh she doesn't like stuffed animals
like she doesn't play with them ever
and i guess it's the same here
she didn't like so she didn't like any of those
well she liked this thing it's it's kinda gross
they all seem to like that
how the um books
she's not into books either at the moment
so it's just like home
same stuff she cares about at home that she does here
do you have some of the same kinds of things at home that you
um i have
i didn't show her these books but we have the keys that she didn't care about and the measuring stuff she has and she doesn't care about and this she loves because it's a bottle
so i didn't think she would recognize that as something that she could drink from
does seem like she
yeah
um so that so i was gonna ask you that too she may recognize that as something that she's seen before used before
uh huh
well i mean
is there anything else you feel like she could recognize
either the names of or what they are
this thing she has but
you know this guy
is that winnie the
stuffed animals
yeah
okay so you have some stuffed animals at home but she doesn't like
she doesn't have any play food yet i guess that's what i should get her
does she have other plastic things at home
she has lots and lots of plastic things
nothing that looks like this though
or that
yeah like rattles and
things designed for somebody her age
i guess
toys
and does she have any dolls at home
she has one that's smaller than this
and uh she likes to chew on it's face and she tried to chew on this one's face
her head as well so
i think she recognized the the babydoll
okay
you recognize this guy
same features
somebody want to eat
seems like when they do like the dolls it's the face
you sure do notice
let's see what else i have for you
so did she like
oh you already answered that about the she liked the spaghetti
i was gonna say did she like plastic stuff all pretty much equally
yeah
she likes plastic stuff
okay
so it doesn't matter what it is it was just good
okay
what else
what else
does she have any toys at home that she really does like that we don't have here
she doesn't have like a a favorite preference of toy it's just what happens whatever happens to be given to her is what she'll play with for a couple seconds but then she'll move on
um the things she likes right now is paper
like i'll just give her a magazine to tear up
and things that make noise when you shake like that
i just i know that she does not like anything soft
that she is just get it away
and do you think there's a reason for that
um probably not fun to chew on i would say
and doesn't make noise
the two most important things
yep
okay
is there um any kind of toy that you feel would be good for her personality whether you have it or not or we have it or not is there anything about her that you feel like would be good
good match with a certain
um like what she has right now the she waves her arms a lot
and if it makes noise when she's waving her arms i think that's what makes her happy
so
she does seem happy
and remote controls she's also very into
they have to be real ones
what does she do with those
um chews
presses
so i went and i actually got her a real remote control to use and she likes it
oh that wouldn't be surprising
we're both
oh and she also likes computer keyboards
i just things that react when pressed and manipulated
so it's hard to say
likes the response
yep
is let's see
does she know the names of any um animals at this point
oh well she knows maybe cat or kitty we have three
but i guess like what do you mean by know
well would she recognize that word perhaps
dorothy kitty
kitty
maybe not
hard to say when there's so much other distractions
yeah
kitty
kitty
kitty cat
yeah
you like your kitty cat
i think she i think she knows
yeah
okay
and would she recognize the names of any food
or drink
uh milk she knows
but i think that's it
alright
did i not ask something that would be good to know about what she likes to play with or how she likes to play
um she likes to play alone
that's why it was hard for me to play with her because normally like she doesn't interact with me so much as she just does her own thing
like she can be on her own for long periods of time
so
i dunno if that's helpful or not
yeah that's very helpful yeah
so she's happy playing by herself
that's great
very good
well i'm gonna go and turn this stuff off
okey doke
is it okay if i ask you some questions
yeah
okay
um what do you think was liked the most
seems to be really partial to the spoon
oh
aw
yeah it's like
bent on the spoon
kept comin back to that
anything else that was that you thought he liked
oh well i don't know he um
he seems to like the stuffed animals
and the tapping the f um
the
food together
tapping things together is kind of where he is right now with his play so
um
yeah
uh what do you think he liked the least
reading the book
which um books did you read
i just tried to read put me
okay
and he wasn't like that
yeah he wasn't wanting structure like that
do you read them at home
yeah we do
um by himself in the evenings we read um books
but most of the play which is sort of i guess if you're like how similar is this to home
it's mostly he's playing with his brother and like he's sitting on my lap and his brother is next to me sort of reading books
and we mostly play with trains
because we have lots of trains and cars
and that's kind of what liam's into
so
wes sort of like watches
and kind of he doesn't really like roll cars and trains he sort of like grabs stuff and taps it together but
that's kind of the extent of our play
um
so he doesn't actually i was thinking about that as we were playing he doesn't get a we don't do a lot of one to play time
so
we get a lot of that in these sessions a lot of parents have other kids and they're like you know we don't really have too much one to when i ask them
you know
yeah when wes was born i made sure i had um one to with liam and liam still gets well actually
when liam takes his nap sometimes wes isn't down
but usually then we're not really playing we're just sort of like hanging out
trying to get him to like
take a nap fall asleep so like
laying laying down
but yeah we don't do a lot of one to play
okay
we do like one to nursing and
and then in the evenings um we split them for bedtime and so he we read books by himself that's like one to time
but yeah
like sort of unstructured play
um what do you guys have stuffed animals at home
yeah um wes has a bear
that he um
he likes
a lot of these kinds of animals we don't play with too much they have the eyes you know
so um
but we do have them
but we don't play with them a whole lot
which ones did you play with today
we pl let's see i did the donkey and the bee and the goose
and the puppet
did you when you played with them did you were you what names were you using
i mean is he familiar with the names you were using to refer to them
no
no
you don't think so
i don't i don't think i haven't like ta i don't think he's seen a donkey before
but i just said like this a donkey says eeaw
so i was doing more like the sounds of the animals and then with the puppet i was singing the song
we'll do a lot of like singing songs
kind of silly songs stuff
the song what was the song about
that was the little rabbit song
oh okay
i've never heard of it
oh really
i guess it's a generational thing but it's like the
little bunny foofoo hoppin through the forrest scoopin up the field mice and bopped on the head
down came the good fairy
and she said
little bunny foofoo i don't wanna to see you scoopin up the field mice and boppin on the head
it's not exactly the best song like the moral isn't that great but it's sort of like cute and you have the little hand actions
yeah
i don't know
yeah oh
that's probably why it's not in style anymore the moral isn't that great of like the bunny boppin the field mice on the head
that's probably why
whatever
can't be
anyway
that's probably why
um
yep so
so which stuffed animal do you not have at home that you played with today
we don't have any of these stuffed animals
the ones that i played with we don't have any of them
those
yeah we don't have a donkey or a bee
or a goose
or a bunny
he might have heard this word bunny before just kind of
liam is very into animals and learning about that so like reading books and stuff but in terms of stuffed animals
that would not be words that he'd be familiar with
peas is a word that he would be familiar with he eats them
so we talk about peas
spaghetti
pasta might be word we eat that
he would've heard that like just not talking to him directly but just in the house
um spoon
that's probably something he's pretty familiar with he usually holds a spoon while we're trying to feed him
okay
so that's probably the word that he's most familiar with in terms of like directly talking to him
book
he's probably pretty familiar with
put me is a book that we have at home
and we've read
do you have any other books at home
not from this group here
okay
but we read the foot in the waiting room
oh okay
so he had just
um heard that one
but yeah of your selection only the only one we have is put me
we do have other books at home
yeah
no
this isn't a survey of you know of like uh
at nighttime we usually read um bear snores
that's sort of like his
set kind of like ritual book
and then a couple of other books that are usually like those sandra boynton ones
you know like the um
sandra boynton has a whole selection of kids' board books
so
oh
we have s we have like a bunch of those
we usually one or two of those
but bear snores is sort of like his book that's like his nighttime cue
the one that we bring with when we travel and everything you know
oh
that's interesting
so
yeah
so do you think he likes
he likes books more than toys or toys more than books
he with books really what he's into is turning the pages
you know so he's not really into like sitting and reading
he's kind of young you know
um
and i think in general he would prefer to bang stuff together
than um
sit and read but he will
and he likes i think he really likes liam sort of the social aspect of books
like as opposed to reading you know
his brother interested in the book and like he really he gets a lot of kicks off of watching liam perform and
do stuff
and so that he really likes
but in terms of actual like books themselves he's not
and i mean he's not against them but he's not like
but hasn't shown the
well he's really into banging things together
so
yeah
you know
that could be trains
that could be blocks
that could be pens
you know like or he's also really into crinkling paper
oh okay
yeah
he's sort of at that stage where like or actually maybe not
but he's sort of at a stage where it's not like a lot of toys
preferential toys he has like his
little um soft
sort of it's like a half stuffed animal half blanket thing that he sleeps with you know and some things like that that are kind of preferred but
and rattles
again that sort of like the banging
noise
manipulating it
if it's interesting to him but
it's interesting
were there any um
other foods that
he played with
he picked up the parfait
um
i think that was it
the peas
this pasta
briefly we did the keys
he did the parfait um i tried to
oh and the ice cone the pink strawberry ice cone
and i tried to interest in him the peanut but he wasn't into that
you think does he have you uh
does he know what peanut is or no
well liam is eating a lot of peanut
sandwiches cut out in the shape of stars right now
so
we talk about it but it's not like
yeah
well i meant just like familiar and you guys really like
if he's been exposed
but we have that's sort of like peanut sandwiches
cut out in the shape of a star
so peanut the word is out there
but not
you know
as much like the jar of peanut
but this also isn't i guess he would be more interested in it if it's like
you know i think that would've been more
of the sound
yeah
tapping things together
that makes sense
that sounds appropriate
yeah
well i think that's all i have um to ask you
oh
you didn't uh play with the babydoll at all do you have any dolls at home
uh
babydolls no
i don't think so
i tried to find one
um but they were all like pink
or purple so i haven't found like a gender neutral one so we just like went on and
we stuffed animals
but yeah no we don't have a babydoll
okay
alright
well that's all
so
for today
what
what do you want
about enough of
i have just a few questions to ask you then we will release her
her torture
what
oh come on talk to me for just a minute
what
you're just about done aren't you
yeah
yeah
where's your pacy
uhoh
uhoh
oh yeah i know you see that
you're one of those you notice electronics
uhoh
what are we gonna do when you're eleven months
and much more active
maybe you're as active as you're gonna be
let's hope
yeah
she's all over
oh boy
yeah well um
so
i guess i want first of all your impressions of what you thought most interested her out of these kinds of toys here
uh
pro the books
okay
and i think it was more to put them in her mouth
okay
she obviously excuse you
didn't want um
want me to hold it for ya
sure
be better
i think it will still pick up your voice
okay
she didn't want to read she just wanted to eat them
eat them was there anything in particular that she wanted to eat from these books
uh
she likes
she likes
the corners of books
i don't know why
any particular book you think
no i don't think so
okay
does she have any books like the this at home
anyth so do you think that she would like that she recognizes any of these as familiar to her
um
well we have the hard book type
oh okay
that she usually has on the floor with her
and she chews on the corners
yes
yes
so you found her the books books were the most interesting for her today
um and what did you think about the least interesting
um i think probably the baby because she's uh dissuaded from playing with the baby at home
ah got it
they're kind of off limits
yeah
yes they are
even her own
oh now you see it
wanna go for it
okay
and what did shh what do you think about um the stuffed animals
go for it
how did she
well look at you
um
she kind of had to find it on her own she had no interest in anything i gave her
which is fine with me
so did she find anything in particular that she liked out of the stuffed animals
definitely the bee
sticky hair
do you think that's why she liked it
i think so
okay
the bee had different textures to it
and how about the food and dishes types of toys
any interest in those
didn't really have not really
okay
she's pretty young but do you think they're any of those items that she would recognize the names of
um
some of this stuff
like tacos and bottle and
okay
soup
it's okay
i mean you got it right there
you said soup
um
is she eating any finger foods
not yet
oh okay
she tries
so uh when she comes back for her next visit soon we'll see if that changes
that will be interesting
probably
yeah
and then do you have you said there's babies at home
any of these other kinds of toys at home
she has books hard books
yeah uh stuffed animals we have a lot of but not really where they play
does she have one that she's attached to at all
no
okay
we have this one at home or at my parent's house actually
that bee
i don't think she's ever played with it she was too young when they got it
so you don't think she likes the sticky hair but it's not because she recognizes it
no
okay
unless she has an incredible memory
okay
um is there anything else i need to
ask
is there anything that you find that she really enjoys playing with or or exploring at home that we don't have here
um
things that make noise the keys kind of do but like a lot of shakers and
some kids find the um pitcher and put something in it and it makes a pretty loud noise
so she would probably like something like that
yeah
okay
things that give instant gratification
like the feeling of the bee
so very sensory
you like that
shh we didn't really she didn't she didn't really play with anything that was very loud this time we'll see what happens
next time if she's still interested in
making noise
nothing really kept her well except for this
except for this bee so that was
you said the books and then maybe the bee
were the things okay
definitely
and um
i'm assuming she's putting things in her mouth at this stage
everything
everything okay
so that would be how she
um
interact with a lot most things probably
yeah
not don't don't let that
here's your pacy
yeah we keep the pacifier in her mouth because she's extremely oral
everything goes in
and everything on the floor happens to be stuff she can't have
that must prevent a lot of frustration to have that pacy in
um it does except she'll spit it out and find what she can't have
do you do that
right when i can't be there to rescue it from her mouth
pretty smart
yes
pretty smart at seven months old
well um
i think that's all i need to ask you about what she likes to play with and how she's playing
and then when she comes back at her ten month or so visit we'll probably ask you very similar kinds of questions and um see how it changes for her
but she seems like she might be done
i think so you're done
yeah
you ready for a nap
again
good work
okay
we're gonna stop you guys
okay
he's so intense today
alright we just have a few questions to ask
okay
sure
um which group of toys would you say that he was most interested in
oh he just liked these few these uh
these kitchen and food ones
he played with those yeah those were fun
yep yep
um do you remember which ones specifically he liked
out of the
you know
i'd say he played with the um the spoon he has there
and the pizza and ice cone were among his first three
the plate in the beginning
okay
yeah
um do you think he recognizes the new play foods
i don't think so
no
we don't yeah we actually don't have any food toys at home
okay
so yeah i'm not i'm not sure most of the toys that we have um make noises or
you know are more like this or
and we usually just you know put him on the floor like this and grab whatever's so
okay
do you think he maybe recognizes other objects maybe not toys but
anything else that might be around the house or
um
i'm just trying to think what he what he has access to
um he may um at daycare he spends a whole lot of time at the kitchen
so he may recognize some of those
um
he doesn't spend much time in our kitchen actually at all so
uh
yeah the things that he would recognize at our house would be like the plush animals and the books which he doesn't really care for the plush animals a whole lot
book he doesn't have he doesn't have patience for
oh okay
but we do we do read to him so he usually just plays with them a little bit
does he have any of these books at home
nope
oh well he has good night
which we do not look at
yeah he does have this one
i didn't know that one was here but no not any of the other ones
okay um which group would you say he was least attracted to or was not interested in
at least
you know the plush ones really
i don't think he really had any interest in those when i tried to get him
yeah
you said he has some animals at home
which ones do you have
um
the main one right now is a monkey
it's a monkey yeah with the arms and legs flying around a lot where he you know he can just grab it by one leg flaps
um and then we have a bear
a bear that's dressed as a bunny so
it's the two of those
so those are the two main ones we don't we don't do a whole lot oh a panda bear too
panda bears that he likes
was he playing with any of them
nope
you
nope
okay and do you remember any other foods that he played with during the session
i think he had
he did the the plates spoons the spoons he just grabbed again here the peanut
pizzas and
these things
he did this for a little bit
he likes things that move
oh
he likes things that move and things that make noise
usually
usually
which i honestly he um at home he doesn't take toys and bang together his toys make noise so if was banging 
yeah
they wouldn't do anything
yeah
okay i think we're all done
okay
yup
thanks
that's it buddy
and he got his prize already
he did
yup
you guys did great
i'm just gonna ask you some questions
i don't have to write it down because we're recording
sure
which toys d you think he liked the best
um the bee
and the peas
and the clock
which toys d you think he liked the least
um the pretend most of the pretend food yeah
i mean he liked the peas
of the texture
and it was within reach
but we haven't done much or he hasn't done much i don't think with pretend stuff
so like the baby and the baby bottles yeah
does he have any toys like this at home
we do we have i mean we have good night
we have another karen katz book
another bright baby
some doctor seuss
um we've done a little bit with stuffed animals
well he has a few stuffed animals that are like his favorite
um but we don't do we're just getting into the stuffed animal thing
and he does not have pretend food
at home i don't think
um d you think there's any items that you think your child recognizes the name of
um i do think so
um he was excited to see the chicken
and w he has a picture of a chicken in his room right next to his changing table
that he can grab
and we always say
oh you're fighting with the chicken dadadada
so i think he definitely recognized
i think he recognized the name of that
um and he's had keys before
and the duck
and like the the pictures in the bright baby we we go through the the names of those
um and i'm sure if we had played more with the pretend bottles he would've recognized the b word
but ah
or m
i guess we just call it milk we don't call it a bottle
so i don't know
are there any toys you think he doesn't recognize that he's never seen before maybe
um well he goes to daycare
like a home daycare with a wide age range
age range of kids
um so i don't know if they it doesn't seem to me that they have a lot of dolls there
so like the baby doll i don't think he's familiar with
um i don't you know so i don't know about the food
um i'm sure he's some of it looks very familiar
and like i know he's he's seen it before
i'm trying to think what else
um yeah maybe you know donkey
kangaroo fox
they're kind of
i don't know what this one is
i guess it's a squirrel
they're kind of not
i'm sorry
groundhog
groundhog yes
so those are kinda like not your regular animals
um but some of the more regular ones like chicken or frog
he's he's definitely seen before
you got it kiddo
good job
that's right
i know it's hard it runs away from you
alright
there you go kiddo
d you think he prefers playing with toys or books
um that's a good question he likes books
but um i think he likes the toys they're more independent
um he has started just the past week or so he's started grabbing the books and pretending to read them himself
but probably toys better
you said you have some of these books at home
right
um so i thought he would be like excited to see familiar stuff
and that's where i like to start
because it gives me some confidence
like oh i know exactly how to play with you with a book
but um so he likes the books but
it's different
so he probably likes toys better
yeah so you're bypassing the book completely
haha
he likes those keys
yeah
they're fun
okay that's it
ask you a few questions
uh huh yeah
um what did she seem to like the most uh today
she loves this baby doll
does she play with baby dolls at home
you know it's funny we have um two soft my first baby dolls
we don't have ones that are like um
i meant to ask you if she could put these in her mouth
is oh oh okay okay oh okay well no i just didn't know if yeah yeah sorry
yes
um she but we don't have one that has like the face like you know i think she was into the face
or she seemed to be enjoying the face and i mean it the one she has is just like a soft sort of stuffed animal so
does she um what kinds of things does she do at home with her baby dolls
um basically she just sort of will hold them they two of them the rattle so she'll shake it to rattle it
she doesn't really play with i mean this is the first time i've really but a lot of times her brother will take them
and then he'll do something with them so she just watches
okay
so you don't usually like like today how did you play with the baby doll
today she was just explore i mean i said oh do you wanna hold the baby or you know but she was basically i mean she really liked the i mean she was just sort of exploring the baby doll
so i guess maybe we should do that more at home
huh
yeah
you like that spoon huh
you like
does she treat the baby doll do you think sometimes or here or there kind of like it's a real baby or a real person
i think today she might
i mean she doesn't necessarily the the the ones at home but
today it sort of seemed and when she first saw the baby doll she has a cousin that's that's older than her but smaller than her
so um sort of sort of the size of the baby doll
and she did the same thing when she first saw her like exploring her face and everything
so it was interesting to see her react to the baby doll cause it was just like anna was right there
it was like ah
uh how about some other things or um that she may have liked
um she did like the um she liked feeling the things on the farm
on the um in the book
and she liked the animals
she loved the the hair on the um the bumble bee
yeah
that's always that tends to be a favorite
yeah
is she familiar with animals or animal names
um we have these baby's first animals you know sort of animals and there's like giraffes and um
and we have and her brother has like a little fisherprice farm so he sort of tells her like the different animals sometimes but
um we we play zoo sometimes
and she has a few animals but not a whole lot so
what who what which animals are in her
in her zoo
she has a giraffe
she has um and elephant
and a lion
okay
yeah
so
so none of the ones that are in there per say
no
well we have um we have a frog a stuffed a frog that william plays with at home
so she is a little familiar with that
and then um the kangaroo her brother likes to pretend he's a kangaroo
but
cause we saw them at we went to the zoo this summer and there were kangaroos at the zoo we went to so
and that's what stuck
yeah
that they hop
yeah
uh how the winnie the
does she have any like
we do have some winnie the stuff at home too
yes
okay
yup
did she seem to be familiar with that when you
um yeah she did
i mean we have one he doesn't exactly look like that and i think will her brother tends to play with it more than she does
but no she seemed to like yeah she
she seemed to we play with food a lot at home
yeah
cause her brother likes that and so that's something that both of them can sort of play with and so
is it play food
yeah oh sorry
sorry we play with play food yes
no
so are there um do you think she's familiar with any of the ones here do you have the same set or
um
well we have plate i mean we have some plates
and she basically likes to hold them and chew on i mean a lot of things right now she's just basically exploring and chewing on so
um but she has we have we have some different foods
but we do have the spoon
and she loves to play with her spoon when i'm feeding when she's eating her cereal and stuff like that
um
and then
what do we have
i think we have bread at home
so she does play with that too
right
is is she explore like tasting any of these foods or
um
the peas we're starting this week but
she's basically just on cereal and the um the yellow vegetables
so carrots and um squash and sweet potato
so
okay
but peas we're gonna start yeah and you're gonna love them
yeah
uh how games like patty cake or um
we do play patty cake
and he brother will play patty cake with her i mean she doesn't she doesn't do it herself but you know i'll do it we do play patty cake
and we'll do peek we'll play where's ella
right
where did ella go
there she is
see it's much more exciting when my brother does it
cause he actually hides
where's william
yeah
what else do we play
william likes to sing a lot of songs
so we end up singing a lot of songs
oh okay
and then we um play with trucks a lot because he has trucks
and so she will play along with that then
okay
and um what else do we do
oh he likes to pretend to play football
so she will help play football
he'll pretend to put her helmet on
and then i'll hold her
and and then sometimes she drives the trash truck
because he likes trash trucks too
so we sit in a chair
and she's the driver
and he hangs on and he goes and gets the trash
so there's a lot of imaginary play
yeah he loves to yes so and he includes ella which is nice
very nice
very nice
right
would you say she likes to play with toys or books more
um
she loves to try to get the books
um but a lot of them when she gets them she'll chew on them
so we can't like let her have many of those
but she does love the books that she can play with
and she does try to take toys um books
and but then she'll chew on them so
um
i think she tends to probably play with her toys a little more
but
if given the chance she might play with the books a little more
right
yeah
i know
were there any um any of the do you have any of the let me start here do you have any of these books at home
the books
um
we have a farm well it's funny we have farm one but i haven't read it with her
so it's interesting to see that she liked that
we have the peek a peekababy
okay
um
and we've read it a couple of times
we also have there's one by the same person about your belly button
i forgot what it's called
it's the same it's the it's the same with the flap but it's um where's baby's belly button and so you look different parts like where's baby's head and it's under the so
oh okay
um
but usually when we read that we have her brother and so he'll like flip it up and do the peek a or whatev you know so
yeah
well that's nice
yeah
uh how uh your so do you think she's familar with like body parts cause you have that like that where's the head and where's
um
well at least with the names like just
she might be familiar with some of the names
yeah
yeah
or her toes the i mean we do toes and fingers a lot
and nose
and your nose
your cute little nose
yeah and your teeth
that are coming in
and then i i think i heard you say that you have a puppet at home
yes we have a frog
do you manipulate it or does william
um
i'll do it sometimes and then he'll do it sometimes too so
cute
we take turns
right
cause sometimes he feels like doing it and sometimes he doesn't
he says mommy you do it
does she ever play independently or do you have much time for the two of you to play yourselves
um
once in a i mean we usually get a few maybe a little time to play um in the evenings
if we don't have anything going on
and so my husband will take one and i'll take the other but that isn't as often as i would like it to happen
yeah
so but i mean she will play she does play independently
by her i mean i'll sit her down in our room and have some toys around her and she'll play with it while i'm you know making dinner or whatever so
or she'll sit in her highchair and play with some toys
or throw them off her highchair more likely
right yes
into the phase
and she has a little phone at home that she loves too
it's just like a rattle phone but she'll
i don't know if she really does it because she knows what it does but her brother will put it up to her i mean he's like oh and he tells her who's on the phone and he's like say hi
aw
then he just frustrated cause you don't say hi
right
that's wonderful though that uh they play together so
no i'm very fortunate that he's very good with her
very patient
you have a patient brother huh
was there anything else um in this room that you thought she was um particularly interested or not interested in
um
tryin think
i mean she was interested in the peek a peekababy but after like the first few pages it was sort of like okay you know i mean she was sort of looking around for other things so
um but i'd also read the other one first so usually we're good one book and then she'll move on but
right
um i'm tryin think what else
what else were you
what do ya thinkin
um
the different ways that you played with so cause the she played with the doll differently today
yes
and were did she play with anything else differently than she usually would
um
i'm tryin think
usually when we set up our little zoo she'll pick the the animals up and just sort of look at them or play with them
um
i don't think so
i mean right now i think partial cause she's teething and probably probably the stage a lot of things she just picks up that's looking at and then will put in her mouth so
yeah
it all goes in the mouth right
unfortunately
alright
yeah
that's all the questions for today
okay
and so he can just keep playing
okay
um
did you notice that he was interested in any set of toys
the food toys which is making me wonder if he's hungry
um the peas
the
mostly the food toys
um the peas the pizza the waffle
the
yeah
the waffle
the pasta
um keys for a little while
and the stuffed animals seemed to hold him from the beginning but not
they didn't seem to to sustain him
okay um
the food was mostly
seem to be his primary interest
okay d you d you guys have play food
we don't
which is kind of interesting
okay
usually food is is food and and when he sees it it's not necessarily in this form
unless well he's sees it on my husband's plate or my plate
like he'll see pizza pieces or or um pasta
right
or peas
um y it's kind of what we eat so
okay um
which is which i kind of thought was interesting
uh and this thing
yeah it's weird looking
yeah
with the crazy hair so
uhoh
yeah
i thought he would be more interested in pooh we have a pooh at home it looks a little like this but
any
guess he's over pooh
um what about the books is he
we read books uh
the only one that was was was good night moon
but we read um
he didn't seemta to to go for the books today
okay
i didn't think
alright
and the lid to the bumbo
alright um
yeah
there's always the lid to the bumbo
um do you think he'd recognize any of the animals in there
um not reall
not really i don't think so no
s we have a dog at home
and he didn't seem to gravitate towards any of those so particularly no
oh okay
um so would you say he likes books or toys right now
um i'm thinking he's more of a toy person at this stage
right
i read to him but he's you know
but th i think he see that as i'm about to go to bed
oh yeah
so i i probably need to to f adjust that a little bit so
like someone's trying to give me to go to sleep
um do you have dolls at home or anything
uh we've got like stuffed things like this like there's a pooh his his vibrates
you know that kind of thing
we have um stuffed animals but he doesn't really play with them they're more of decoration for the for the room
yeah
it's not really he'll grab at it an but he doesn't necessarily
play with them
play with them per se
he plays with um
aw okay
he plays with little helicopters or
or or little like um happy meal food
oh yeah
those ki of happy meal food toys
those kinds of those kinds of toys
aw sweet pea
aw
shh
we're almost done
he's i don't wanna keep him here
oh he'll be alright
do you think is there anything else
um well he does usually play oh
during the day with my mother
uh and he plays with his niece
and as long as she's on the floor with him
he tends to play a little bit longer than he does
uh when he's alone or when he's uh you know when he doesn't when he doesn't have her
even uh he plays wi lo with her like even longer than i play with
oh okay
so um s
aw sweetie pie
aw
so not really uh
starting to get sleepy
not really a si not really a sibling
but since they spend so much time together
she's she'll be two in august
okay
august seventeenth
so that's the one thing about them play about playing
um and i mean it's just you know it's like helicopters and
yeah
i call happy happy meal toys
yeah
but not really so much
he doesn't really seem to gravitate much to dolls
yeah
they don't they don't do anything really
right
they just sit there
but he's got uh
like a little s a push truck that plays music
and he he seems to like those
it makes a noise
yeah
so so jingle balls and and those you know those those things that make a noise so any um
right
uh i think he gets in direct keys
just because they're of those
okay
so
and he likes things that aren't toys
yeah
anything that's not a toy it's th that's where we wanna go
like mommy's makeup counter and c
facial cleanser and
wires
wires yeah the wires
those are always fun
but that's you know
that's it
okay i think we are finished
this is colin powell
right
today is july twenty fourth and this is visit one
well okay we're gonna do the questions again
the cookie was far superior to all the other toys
oh really
cookie is the winner
cookie's the winner
oh okay uh so she was interested in the foods i guess overall
yeah i think the plastic food toys were the ones i mean she did grab the book first but she went to the cookie and that was her thing
okay um okay so same questions uh which toy would you say is a good toy for her personality
or the best toy
the cookie
okay what about which did she seem least interested in
um
the book
i mean she grabbed it but then she wasn't interested she didn't wanna read the book
okay
i mean she kinda wanted she want it and then realized there were other things that were better to chew on and
okay
so did she look at the animals you said
a little bit yeah she spent some time with the frog and with the donkey and spent a little time with them and then went back to the food stuff
okay um
um
so would you say she's interested in books or toys or is it still the same thing too early to say
um she's interested in both books and toys today she preferred toys
okay
alight um
but at home sometimes she prefers the books you know it just depends on her mood
okay i think we answered all the questions uh before but um is there anything different about the way she plays at home
uh did you want to tell us or baby toys or anything
no
nope
um she spends more time on her back playing with a toy up like this
oh okay
than her sister does um
she i mean as you can see she plays on her stomach also um
but a lot of times she'll just be on her back and she'll hold a toy up and play with it like that
oh okay
well i think that is it then
okay
uh
okay
participant five eight three seven a k today is nine fifteen two thousand nine
okay i'll go ahead and do the questions now
okay
um i'll get on the floor
okay
um which toys did she seem most interested in
well i kinda put her down in the middle and she gravitated toward the books right away um
we we read books a lot at home so that may have been familiar to her
um we don't have as many of these toys at home so this was kind of new
toward the end she's li started chewing on the cheese
um and so that was interesting
and she liked this kangaroo a lot
oh okay
alright uh
but she seemed more interested in it as a toy than as a puppet like when i tried to do the puppet thing
yeah she wasn't
she wasn't feelin it
okay so which would you say she liked the least uh out of these three
which pile
oh um probably the well i dunno cause
can i say that she was kind of equally interested i think she was ki
um yeah that's fine
i think she was equally interested in
oh okay
in them
alright um do you have any of these books at home
um not in particular no we ha we have lots of books like these but not any of these titles
okay
um i know she's still kind of young but do you think there are any items she um might recognize
any of the names of
yeah i definitely don't think she recognizes any of the food items everything she eats is pureed so we're not um we're not into that
um book shh we read books a lot and we say the word book a lot so the fact that this is a book she might be picking up on that
okay
um but the rest of it i would say no she doesn't recognize it
okay
um so you say you would say she likes books over toys
prefers them or
i dunno
i dunno
yeah i dunno if i would say that she prefers them
i would say she she likes books but she also likes toys
okay
she likes both
alright um
do you guys have dolls at home does she play with dolls
um we don't have very many dolls
um no not at this point
we do have some stuffed animals
um and we've got just lots of like teething r rings and plastic baby toys
oh okay
and for the most part that's what she plays with at home
okay
um so which toy would you say is best for her um personality
i would say things she can chew on
i would say the plastic things that she could chew on right now
um yeah we're dealing with some teething issues so she's putting everything in her mouth
alright i think that's it
um unless is there anything you can think about about how she plays at home you want to tell us
favorite toys or anything
she goes from one thing to the other as you can see she's pretty mobile so she doesn't stay on one toy or one thing for very long she switches
okay alright uh we are all done then
you can go ahead and just keep playing
okay
and then i have some questions i wanted to ask
okay
and its just much easier to get your answers while you're still wearing that and then i don't have to
okay
sure oh okay absolutely
so what did you think interested her the most out of the toys that we have here
uh this bumblebee for sure
and the spoon
why do you think she likes those likes that in particular
uh i think the colors and uh she's never
this is pretty stringy
i think the material
it's different
yeah and she doesn't have anything like that at all
okay
and it probably the texture probably feels different in her mouth
uh huh
and then she so she really likes that
yeah
what else does she like
the spoon this purple spoon
okay
we're gonna have to get some spoons out for you we don't have any spoons
is that her favorite one
i think we have a couple
this one yeah
this purple one and um and then the keys
she likes the keys
but uh i think this one
this one for sure
oh you got on your face
okay good
and so you said the texture with that do you think the other things as well
is that why she likes the spoons and keys and stuff the texture
no i think these are hard and i think it probably feels good on her her teeth
and it fits in her mouth pretty good
and its easy for her to to wield it you know
she has a lot to see
yeah she's
um okay good and how what do you think interested her the least
the book
the books i think and maybe the stuffed ani the other stuffed animals
most of hers have you know little squeaky things so it was kinda a little bit hard to get her attention
but that's all right
were you showing her some of those
yeah this one and the the pink poodle and the goose and the zebra
she didn't i'm surprised she didn't pick up on this usually the white and black grabs her attention
but uh yeah
maybe that one
this was hard to compete with
that one was gone she would've liked that one better over there
okay so you think stuffed animals and the books
yeah i mean i didn't explore the doll with her and she doesn't really have any
i mean she's never been exposed to a doll so i mean but
she was really kind of focused over this area
um so do you have for instance toys like the dishes and food at home
no we don't have dishes and food
um she has lots of stuffed animals
she has lots of books
um
and no baby dolls
no baby doll no
and um do you think out of any of the items here there are any that she would recognize the names of
or would she have heard before
well i was looking for a giraffe i was wondering if she re she has a a chew toy that's a giraffe
um just to see if she would recognize it
its kinda shaped the same
um and i was wondering if she might pick up on the book
the term book
but she didn't really seem to pay any attention to it so
we'll see next time
yeah
she may be less interested in that next time
maybe i it interests me and i you know this is the one that i picked up first it was different than anything she's seen
um so i can try something different next time and see if she
see what she does
yeah
there's a lot of change that can happen between now and then
and i know she wasn't really interested in the books today but does she have books at home
are there ones that she likes better
um she likes the well yeah i was kinda well she's sitting on it the one that has the feely
oh its right here
yeah um but uh she's got some other ones that just um like there's a farm animal book that she likes
um and then there's a numbers book that just has big big pictures in it but i don't think you know i think she
they're bigger too and so that she can they lay out in front of her and she can just kinda crawl on it and stuff
does she like oh sorry
those seem to capture
she tries
she tries
uh i don't know she tends to get a little frustrated and then move on to the next thing
yeah we we actually have a bunch toys that are kinds scattered out and so i don't not sure if that's a good thing or not
its easy distraction and then she doesn't you know tend to work on the the one item
right
okay
and actually she likes we have blocks
i don't see any blocks here
that was gonna be another question is are there toys that we don't have here
yeah yeah she has some foam blocks and some wooden blocks
um and then the um stacking rings thing
and oh and in the waiting room you had the little the maize thing
she has one of those too and she actually does um i don't know if that she's realized she can move along the wire but she does like to grab onto it and and spin 
okay so she likes blocks and the maize thing
and
what else did you say there was one more thing
oh the uh stacking ring thing
yeah and she actually she likes anything that makes noise
okay
so she's got a little key ring that that makes noise and there's a couple other little toys like that if you press the right and oh what she really likes is her exersaucer
okay
with all the other you know the spinning things with the the confetti type stuff in it and the mirrors and oh she has a mirror she really likes yeah
okay okay that's interesting to know
yeah it it's a it's a fish shaped like a fish so when you hit it makes you know like kinda of undersea bubble noises and then its got the mirror on it
um she's liked that from very early on
and she still does
yeah she still does yeah
um okay do you think she would recognize the name of any of the food items
oh careful
did you put that a little too far back
i seriously doubt it
okay
she had a ice cream cone
recognize ice cream
i don't know
hard to tell right now
yeah
okay and i think i asked you everything i have here
um oh so the things she likes the best do you is there a reason you think they might be good for her personality like the kind of infant she is or not necessarily
oh careful sweetheart
here you mean
yeah
um because of her personality
yeah
um i i it's hard to say
i mean i think she picked up on this because it was different and that so that's you know she's generally pretty curious and wants to you know explore different things
that's part of the reason
um yeah it's hard to know if that's personality or
and at home what do you think
at home um
um i think well i mean if the exersaucer counts as a toy i mean i think she likes that because she can actually um jump up and down and she's not like
she falls over at home sometimes and i think she that limits a little bit how far she's willing to go at times especially if she's tired
um i don't know that's a tough question
that's okay
um she likes the little toys and i think mostly because she can easily grab and put them in her mouth
right
um
and its hard here for her to be as active as she might at home so with the set up but just curious sometimes um if there's differences based on activity level or
yeah
how much curiosity so that's the reason for asking
that's fine we're probably gonna ask you the same questions next time
okay
alright
comes back
i'll have to i didn't think personality i was thinkin that she was just curious and so she you know she
she does move pretty good at home
um so
okay we'll see how she changes
yeah okay
between now and then she may play differently
she may like different things so we'll have the same toys and we'll see how it goes
okay okay good
good good
is it okay if i ask you some questions now
sure
what do you think he liked to play with the most what was his favorite
this li cookie
how did he play with it
um
i think it's like it's kind of novel as far as a toy that he can fit in his hand really easily
so he 
i don't know
feelin it bangin it
stickin it in his mouth
and he set it down and he'd play something else and he'd come right back to it
so
was there anything else do you think he knows is familiar with either the like the name of it or the shape or the color what do you think was most attractive
it might be that it's colorful or
i'm trying to think i can't even think of a single toy that we have that looks like this
at our house
so it might be the fact that it's novel
um
but like i tried to show him the peas which are about the same size i thought they'd be equally interesting and they're not
they're just not so i think it's a combination of color and
maybe size
once he got it in his hand like this
just like
what was that
yeah
you just love it
i'm kind of baffled
i think too i don't know it might be recognizeably recognizeable as food
something that looks like food
was he putting it in his mouth
yeah
yeah
yup
and he's just starting to get to finger foods now like where he wants to put his own food in his mouth
even though he's not very successful
he's trying
he's trying
were there any other toys that he liked playing with
he liked he likes books in general he liked this one better than he liked he wanted to read this one
he was navigating his own way through this one
turning the pages and feeling all the things and then you turn the page and feel the things so
he really liked that one
he liked the keys
they make a shaky noise huh
and he played with this one for a significant amount of time
and the spoon
that's pretty typical we have a lot of like long handle spoons and stuff that i let him play with he really likes those in general
i tried a couple stuffed animals and he was not interested
do you have um keys for him to play with at home or
yeah nothing quite that small or easily to manage i think his stuff is a little more bulky to manage so i think
this is a little attractive
because it's a little bit easier to wield
you think the noise was attractive
i think so
um
but he seemed as interested just to look at as to shake them i don't know he shook them more than he shook other things though
i think probably the noise was important
did um he did did you try to play with the babydoll or did you try to introduce that
i didn't introduce the babydoll we've looked at babydolls at our house before and he hasn't been that interested
mkay
not yet
what do you think was the least favorite thing
not yet
in here
well
i don't know like i said i tried to use the stuffed animals and he's just not interested
i don't know if it's
i don't know
so we try to use at home too and it's just not interesting too
stuffed animals are just not interesting
were the animal names in on the book do you think that any of were familiar to him
yeah i think so i think the
well i'm not sure if the animal names he knows the s well i think he recognizes the sounds a little more like if i moo
or if i baa like a sheep
or like the horse whinny he really loves the horse whinny it makes him giggle
everytime
so i think maybe he recognizes some of th i think he recognizes some of the animal sounds
particularly the cow the sheep and the horse
the sound effects that you bring with it
yeah
yeah
okay
um and then i noticed you call what are do you always call him scott or scottie what are some
it's usually scott or scottie his dad sometimes calls him pants
i have no idea why
scott or scottie though most of the time
his brother usually calls him scottie
are you using any um baby signs
just a little bit like more and book are pretty much the extent of baby signs at this point
okay
um how is it different than uh playing at home
do you
um despite i think he has a sibling so also playing together
sometimes
um his brother's at the age where he appreciates social interaction um positive social interaction so
when he feels like his brother's entertained by him he's really happy about that so he does try to entertain scott a lot
and sing songs then plays with his toes and things like that
and he occasionally tries to read him books like he has some memorized that he'll try to read to him
oh
which is really fun
and he loves it he just eats it up
he adores his brother of course
as all younger siblings do right
um
and usually he wants whatever his older brother has and that's off limits
it's always you know the older brother's like no i'm not gonna share with you
so
um do you i think you played also with the clock do you think as far as a time do you have a clock at home
i have a big one on the wall
but the numbers are different
yeah
like ours we have like roman numeral numbers or whatever so
i'm not sure if he's familiar with it at all
pretty high up on the wall too like i was thinking about it i don't i just don't even know if it's in his range of vision most of the time he's like on the floor or on the couch and that's still like another three or four feet above him so
yeah
so do you do like uh counting with him
we do by default because we're working on it with his brother
a lot
so he does hear those
he hears those words those numbers a lot
hi
what can i do for you you're so busy playing
what can i do for you
what can i do for you
do you ever play um like pattycake or any other types of like touchy kind of games like sensor
yes
we do pattycake we do
called one called ball for baby
and usually what i do is i do like the little signs while i'm singing it and then i hold his hands and let him do and he thinks that's very funny
and we have a mirror
like i pulled a mirror out of our bedroom
and i will sit with him on my lap and we'll look in and i'll let him do the hand signs and he enjoys that too like he thinks it's very cool to watch the baby do it
that's really cute
and then like stuff uh tick like tickling games and things like that
oh he loves it
he loves to be tickled huh
psst
psst
psst psst
psst psst psst psst psst get you
he already knows what's coming
yeah
yep
um do you think he knows any of these foods i know we kind of strayed away from there but any of them being familiar or looking familiar or
that's a good question sorry i'll try not to cough in the microphone um
i don't know actually
like he is as yet he's not really started finger foods yet
most of his stuff is puree
and so what he sees or i think like the only thing like he probably recognizes is the banana
that's the only thing he gets more up close
um
tryin to think
like he might recognize bread we do a lot of sandwiches at lunch time with his brother but
i don't know
he's a little bit lower i'm like trying to think he's like a little bit his high chair's a little bit lower than
the table so his eye level's like right at the table level like maybe two inches above it would be hard for him to really see the food so i don't think so
okay
it's uh you know
he's young
yeah
sometimes when there's another sibling they hear a lot of you know like pizza or whatever the sibling is
into yeah
yeah
exactly
um and then are you doing like body parts with him or
sometimes we do mostly we're doing the ones that he's excited about so we're working right now with toes and feet and fingers and hands
and that's about it
i think we do eyes
we've been doing eyes too
yeah
so do you just a final question is there anything that you think was like very different in how he played with you today
um than usual
um
no i think this is pretty typical
he self a lot of his play
he likes for me to play with him but especially if a toy is new he'll play by himself for a long time like without
yeah it is really nice
both of my boys are like that
a long attention span
yeah
he is really practicing
talking
he's been doing this since he was born like seriously he's like the biggest chatterbox i've ever since
really
in fact one of our friends likes like trying to adopt right now and they're like we just we just decided we just want your baby
because he's um the husband really likes the incredibles and you've seen like the little video of like jack jack like burst into flames or whatever and he's just like just like jabbering all the time
this is what he does
and so our friends like love that
bless you
you okay
yeah
you okay
got it under control
yeah
yeah
say hi sabrina
hi
okay so that concludes the uh
yup
okay what do you think ava enjoyed the most
playing today
um
she liked the baby
she doesn't have a babydoll at home
she doesn't
she doesn't
so um
that was new for her
um
she really likes books
she has a lot of books at home she loves to just turn the pages um
see she's going after the baby again
and then she likes um she liked this thing
like the fur
um
she plays with she has a couple things at home that have a little fur
she's like she likes the baby
um
yeah and i guess the things that made noise like the keys and this thing
how would with regards to the baby what do you think that she liked about the baby
um
she does that when she's trying to show off and get your attention she'll go sideways i don't know why
um
i think because it's the same size at her
um
she has a couple stuffed animals and she's more interested in the ones that are the bigger ones that are about her size
i think the face
like the eyes i think she's in tune with
and i don't know maybe this one
because it looks like her and i think because it makes noise
it's head makes noise
it's like a rattle but
maybe that's disgusting she likes to kiss it
it's okay yeah we we clean the toys it's fine yeah
okay
um what do you think what were the kind of things that you were doing to kind of keep her engaged with the baby
um
just like made it talk to her
um i sat it on my lap i wasn't sure if she would like get jealous or not but
she didn't seem to care she came over and gave it a kiss so
that's nice
yeah
uh yeah
i think maybe we should get her a babydoll
what do you think about the um the books
do you have similar books at home
um
the books that are her favorite at home are the one that have um the touchy feely things in them um
she likes those the best
um she likes to run her hand down the page and try to figure out like where it is
um
and plus i think it makes easier to turn
they're kinda halfway open so she can turn the pages really easy
um so i think those are her favorite um
yeah
i guess maybe the colors
but she wasn't you know she liked this one but not really the other ones so
what kind of textures do you think she likes the most
she likes the fur
um
she i guess that's her fine motor skills workin on that um
yeah she likes the fur i think
um
and then this one doesn't have any
but at home we have ones that have like uh like bumps
or like uh like velcro you know like the scratchy part of the velcro she loves those
interesting
yeah i don't know why i guess it's real easy for her to feel
yeah
so she likes those
and um
i think you played were you playing uh peek a or was that
no
i don't think so
she likes to play peek a and actually she um she'll play peek a with herself
so she'll take a cover up over her head and then pull it off
aw
and she'll do it as long as you're if you keep sayin where's ava where's ava
oh there she is
then she'll do it
so yeah she plays she likes peek a a lot
that's cute
one of her favorite games
so
and then this book happened to be um about animals
do you think she you've been over certain names of animals with her or
um
well we have a cat and she knows the word for cat like if i
normally if i say it
she'll start like lookin around and trying to find the cat
so um
hey ava cat
cat
no she's not here i'm sorry
so
but yeah so she really likes the cat
that's the one that she cat and parrot too
we have a stuffed parrot and she likes that
that's
it's a um
so yeah she liked the this puppet
and her parrot at home is a puppet
and so she likes that
i don't know know it reacts or something i don't know
and it tickles
what um were there any other animals stuffed animals that you played with
um this one oh she played with this guy she liked this
stuff
sss
yeah she likes that part
yeah she can pull it and
yeah
it's kinda like sticky
and um a couple of her animals have like little fur like stuff they're not sticky like this but um
little strings for their tails
and she'll sit there and just like pull on for you know keep her entertained for about five minutes which
in her day that's a long time so
yeah
do you think she'd recognize the name for bee
no
no
no she only knows um
i think like three words
maybe four she knows up
and she knows cat
and i think mama and kissy
i noticed you had um she was running over to the camera and so you were giving her uh you know you said some no and she stopped
oh yeah she does know no
yeah
and then during the play you were saying good job and was wondering if you felt like i noticed she understood the no and i was just wondering
um she does i think she understands praise for sure
um that's how we got her to like if we say give mommy kissy she'll give you a kiss um and then we made like such a big deal out of it
and so now she does it for the praise i think
right now we're working on high and uh
so she'll do that
um but i think she does know when you're like good job good job and she gets excited so
um and what about any of the play food
did she
um she
doesn't really well she was interested in the spaghetti for some rea she doesn't eat any finger foods at all she only has purees so
she doesn't know what any of it is
um
and she doesn't drink out of a juice cup either so the juice i think was interesting it moved but um
she doesn't know what is
and then she played with the pizza but
i don't think she's ever seen pizza before
i think it was just the colors
the contrast on there
that makes sense
so and plus it's kind of squishy
so there's not really anything that she that you may have used the name of at home or something that she'd be familiar with or even
um
no
she nope
nope not even
n i mean she doesn't even drink a bottle so um
yeah
so yeah she doesn't really
not yet
what do you think she was least interested in
today
um probably the food
um
and then i mean she didn't really pay attention to this that much
um
i don't expect her to know what a clock is
um and i mean then particular stuffed animals i guess
like these aren't necessarily as brightly colored so
she didn't really go for those and like
she didn't look at um any of these books she has this book but she doesn't look at it
um
she didn't really play with any of this stuff
um yeah
and now she's playing with the pizza again
and the spaghetti
but you did so do you have um stuffed animals at home
we have some
we have some stuffed animals
and she plays with those
um
she like i said she plays with a lot of books
she spends the majority of her time on the floor
um like
she doesn't go in her bouncer she doesn't go in a swing
she doesn't i don't carry her in a sling
she we have an exersaucer
she hates it
doesn't wanna be in it
so um
she spends most of her time crawlin around or um
she can pull up on things and so she just likes to
you know crawl and over to like couch and pull up on the couch and sometimes i'll like spread toys out on the couch and she plays with them um
and then she has a lot of little like i don't know like fisher price like little activity things that she'll play with
and those keep her entertained but
yeah she's not really into all the automated kind of like swings and stuff so um
she spends most of her time just kind of hangin out on the floor crawlin around and chasin the cat and and stuff so
sounds like she just likes to be free
she does
she doesn't like to be confined
um she does like to go in her stroller that's the one thing um
she likes to go on walks
she likes to be outside um
so we try to spend at least an hour or two outside
just like walkin around and lookin at stuff so
yeah
she doesn't like to be if we're inside um all day
or we don't go anywhere that day she gets really like ornery
like she wants to go somewhere just
doesn't matter where like target the mall she doesn't care just doesn't wanna be home all the time so
right
well that's nice
yeah
that's nice you're social
yeah
um well i guess i think i just had uh one question about the stuffed animals it seems like she tends to play with toys
and that seemed to be something she liked here today
and that's if because you had gone i feel like you played with a lot of stuffed animals
yeah
um does she have any did you find any in particular that she liked or did you feel that it was better to kind of go through them all
um well we didn't go through them all
i mean we looked at this one it has sparkles she likes things that are sparkly
she likes that guy
and then she liked this fur
it's not my puppy
and on the first page is this book
actually we have the book with us and it looks just like this dog so
she played with that
and it looks just like it
he came right outta your book
yeah
she may recognize that
yeah
um but yeah she likes stuffed animals and like i said um we have a our parrot is a puppet and she really likes that so we played with this
she um has a really short attention span so
i mean i'm sure all babies do but she doesn't like concentrate on something for very long
so um that's why we went through a lot of 
a lot of toys keepin her happy
do you feel like she played similarly here as she does at home
um i think she wasn't frustrated here sometimes at home i think she gets bored or frustrated with like the same toys so um
these were newer so i think they held enter her attention span longer
um
which is good
yeah
well good
so
well i'm glad that she enjoyed herself
yeah
we have a couple more visits just like this okay
yup
and we don't have carpet at home so she was playing with the carpet a little bit too so um
we just have hardwood floors so i think she she was playing with the colors she was doing that in the waiting room too
oh really
yeah she was like trying to pick at 
that's funny
yeah
alright well i'm just going to stop all of the recording and equipment now
okay
is it okay if i ask you some questions
okay
um what do you think uh miles liked the most today
anything that he could chew on
that was more firm
as opposed to the stuffed animals
i imagine because he's teething
what were some of those
like the food
like the waffle
the waffle was a big hit
the plates
the spoon
he enjoyed the books some too
do you read books at home
well i try
after a couple pages he usually takes them away and tries to chew on them
how about uh do you have any of the same books at home or any similar themes
uh i don't think we have any of these
we have one similar to this animal one
it has you know touch and feel
animals
is he getting familar with like uh animal names
i don't know at this point if he's made that connection yet
yeah
it's hard to tell
does he have any similar um toys with the stuffed animals
um he does have stuffed animals
he's got a winnie the about this size
but most of his stuffed animals are bigger
his size
uh not quite that big
kind of standard teddy size
did um did you two play with the doll at all today
i showed it to him and he wasn't interested and went back to chewing on the waffle
does he have any dolls at home
i don't think he has any
i don't think so
what kinda toys does he have at home
like how does he like to usually play or do you usually like to play together
um types of toys he has at home
i mean he has story books and he has some stuffed animals
he's not typically as interested in those
he's got like a little ball with a jingle bell inside it and he likes
anything he can kind of chew on he likes
and he's got a toy phone that makes sound and talks to him
he likes that
but usually he's trying to get the remote control or our cellphones
so we've given him an old cellphone and things like that
and if we're playing together we'll often do we may not be playing with a toy per se but doing like you know the airplane game or
more physical type things
okay
do you think any of the
oops i'm sorry
you're okay
food names um of the foods that are here are familar
like things that you eat at home that he's heard the name of
um peas
he's had peas
um he might have heard pizza
probably not waffles
yeah
that would
cheese i guess but he didn't play with the cheese
did he get um does he play with keys at home
with keys
uh i mean he's got a
some toy keys
toy keyring type thing
but not really not real ones
he'd probably like to but we don't want them lost so
yeah good call
or he'd stab himself in the eye or something
do you think the way he played today is like the way he plays at home
yeah i think so
do you usually have like the toys all spread around or
i was gonna say not nearly this many toys out at one time
i guess it's like i mean in some ways it's similar to how he plays at home but often at home he'll play with a toy for a little bit and then he'll crawl over and pull up on the couch or
i mean he's very into
there aren't this many toys around
he's very into seeing what he can find next and things to pull up on
try to reach and grab
oh you like that
yeah it's a baby like you
kind of
yeah
you gonna eat her head now
or his
i can't tell
the gender of the doll but
it's neutral i think
the baby's head
yeah
yeah
does he like thing's that make music
um like out of like you know sound texture and color what do you think he's most attracted to
mostly probably to texture at this point because he's really into chewing everything
um but he does yeah he does like things that make that play music or sounds
that's why he likes like i've said the toy telephone that he's got
you push buttons and winnie the talks to you and stuff
he likes that
and he likes whatever we have of course
are books you'd mentioned that with books it's only about like two or three pages in
are there any books that he's more interested in than others
um i'm not sure if he's more interested in some than others
when you first open a book he usually gets really excited
you know he likes to see the pictures
i mean i guess most of the books he's looked at have animals in them
he likes he's excited at first but then he remembers that he wants to chew on it
do you think that um like out of the books here which books had you chosen to kind of play with him
um i'm not sure if i
i don't remember now if he grabbed either one of these or if i grabbed
i think he grabbed this one
like i said this is similar to what we have at home
and this one i may have grabbed just because it's dr seuss
i like dr seuss
okay
i thought he probably would too
the like rhyming words
right
and the pictures are pretty
they're pretty attractive to a baby i would think
bright colors and happy creatures
do you say things like body parts to him
like this is your foot or feet or eyes or nose or any of that at this point
i guess we do
i mean it's something i haven't explicity thought of
to some degree yes
not you know going through them all ritualistically or anything
yeah
i just meant since that's the foot so i thought maybe like
right yeah
we point out things like that to some degree
do you have pets at home
we don't
so like um the difference between like like kind of not the typical dog but he wouldn't be super familar
i mean he's been around
his grandparents have pets
so he's been around dogs and cats when we've visited
but i don't know if he can categorize what's a dog yet or anything
yeah
well i mean i often ask like what would be like familiar to them like horsie piggy something like that because at this age
most kids haven't seen a lot of horses and
yeah
right so i just kind of think well is it familiar as in have they heard of it
right
is something is there a book on horsies that you read or something like that you know
right
i guess we yeah i guess we do have a few a couple different barnyard type animal books
it seems to be a popular theme for baby books
where ya going
he's swimming on the toys
that one wasn't squishy enough
that's funny
is there anything else about the session that um you thought was like particularly a lot like him or not at all like him
um
nothing in particular
i mean for playing with toys it's pretty typical of what he would do
just he often would you know be off in some other direction too
i think that's probably just because there are so many toys and they're all new to him so
i do try to switch out the toys that he has out every week or so so that it keeps it more interesting for him
that's good
do you kind of like change the theme of the toy's too
i mean it's nothing that scientific about it
just put a couple back in the toybox
take a couple different ones out
okay
yeah
alright well i think that's it for today
would it be okay if i asked you some questions
sure
what do you think rosie liked playing the most with today
well it seems like she found her two favorite things
she's liked the keys
and i think the measuring spoon pro the best
does she have those at home
no
she has like
a toy key ring
that's like kind of similar
that's a teether
she likes to kind of make the same noises as that
what do you think was her least favorite
well
what do you think
she seemed to like this stuffed animal with these guys
but in general
she didn't seem to go for any other stuffed animals
she likes more of the stuff she can make noises with
that has some more
kind of plastic
crunches and stuff
do you think that she is familiar with the names of the animals
of those
no
probably not
played with
well we talk about bees but i don't know if she would associate that with a bee
but we don't really talk about foxes
or donkeys
frogs maybe
otters don't really come up
goslings and fawns no
how about the food is she eating or using a spoon to eat
she will try to take the spoon out of my hand
when i feed her and
sometimes we will give her own spoon
um and for food
you know none of this food is similar to what she eats
visually similar
um we have never had ice cream cones in front of her
um we have eaten sandwiches and stuff
but i don't think i don't think any of these look visually enough like we eat for her
for her to make that connection
cheese though
she has seen us eat a lot of cheese slices
and lately we have been giving her little bits of that
so that would probably be the one most similar
does she play with baby dolls at home
she has a couple um
you know soft plush kind of dolls
but they don't look like babies
you know a yarn knit kitten
she likes that
all the other baby dolls that she has she hasn't got into yet
yeah
how about the books do you read books at home
we read books a lot
at home
um yeah
and sometimes she shows more interest then others
sometimes you know she will she will just get it out to gnaw on it
sometimes she will actually turn pages
kind of play with it
and then gnaw half way through
but we have books
a lot of books upstairs downstairs
in the nursery
in the car
do you have any of the same books at home
no we haven't had any doctor seuss books at home
we have this one but it looks different
it's not the counting one
but none of the doctor seuss ones we have at home
do you think she is familiar with any of the animal names or sounds
she she i would think she would be familiar with moo
because we do moo a lot with cows
the buzz of the bee
cock a we do rooster sounds at home
ye
um so yeah sounds like that
the animal um like cows and stuff
she could be familiar with and colors
which this one had a lot of colors
and we do we do read lots of books
that have colors that you say
i think
i think
how about any games like um peekaboo pattycake that kind of stuff
yes we play those at home a lot
and she she really likes pattycake
she hasn't figured out what to do but but when you talk about pattycake and when you do it with her she smiles
and gets animated
and excited
she thinks that's fun
peekaboo she is starting to get more into now
where she will you know pull the little burp cloth off my head
if i put it on me and find me
or pull it off herself
and we say peekaboo so that's a fun game
ye i know
you wanna be up
well one thing that i notice whenever she is somewhere new with new toys
she will kind of sit
and observe for a while
you know she will she will get whats near her
but she kinda is an observer in the beginning
she will get comfortable and familiar
and then she will start to verbalize or vocalize
kind of get interested and going a little farther
to get stuff
but at home where she knows most of the toys
when we set her down
she just starts going you know
so as we get as we go for playdates places and stuff
in the beginning she will just sort of sit and hold court
and look around
maybe reach for something or play with what you give her
and be very quiet
and then she will start
kind of getting a little more expressive
so i think this held
true to that that she kind of sat and
looked around and found something nearby like the bee
and then when she got a little bit more comfortable then she would go find other stuff
she wanted ye ye ye
but lately especially as she's kind of
in the last few weeks
hit this kind of milestone of getting more comfortable crawling
going up to standing lately
that's been more entertaining to her
its like toys don't even have to be there
if she can just crawl on you
stand up
pull on stuff
it's like everything except her toys will interest her
at this point
i just want to stand
that's the best game of all
much to mommy to grin
right
because we just stand in our crib
now
oh you want that
you can sit down and get that
um lets see which one rosie
i think you kind of were more interested in the sounds
one maybe
i think you were more interested when we said like moo
and clap clap clap
knock knock knock
do you like the sounds better
i think so
i think that was your favorite
so the sound effects
i think the book of wonderful noises
ye moo
i did it i said it
that was me
oh
well i think that was it for today
cool
okay
go play
go play
um
so what do you think he liked playing with the most
these animals
we don't have these at home
we don't have any of those stuffed animals
so i think those were completely different for him
he does have uh keys that he carries ar that he uses all the time
so he did like these too
okay
or his other ones
those were his two favorite things
i think so
yeah and we don't have any of these these plastic foods
so i think that was interesting
but uh we do have a lot of books
but he didn't seem that interested in them here
so
okay
um with regards to the animals were um were some of the names familiar to him
like from books or
um definitely the dog and like a
yeah and the fox would be the two that i think were familiar
okay
so the other ones i would not so much
no
which ones do you think were like really uncommon for him
um in terms of the names like the zebra and the frog
oh goodness
winnie the we haven't done
one second
okay
okay
i'll be out soon
no
it's okay
anticipating
that
yeah
sorry about that
that's okay
um so definitely like the dog and the fox i know we have stories about
and
but like winnie the he's not familiar with
um and nothing anything with
so most of the other ones
yeah
uhoh
because i'm not writing anything down
something happened to the
yeah
was it like a
i'll get up and then see if
oh there it is
there it is
okay
okay
oh
yeah yeah yeah just
um
so how do you play with the how did you play with the animals today
did you think that he liked it
well today what i i only did was i just like put them infront of him and named them
um i think other ways i could have done it is to kind of get go on this side and use different voices to play with him
and i didn't do that
um but that would be something else that i could do too
okay
and then the food
do you think it was was there where there any names or colors or looks that look were familiar to him
do you think
no
not yet
i don't
he doesn't really eat anything like this yet
um i think he was attracted to the like the he really liked the ice cone and the peas
those are the his two favorites
um and he's eaten peas
but they don't look like that when he eats them
so
and he hasn't had ice yet
so
okay
how did you play with the food
did you try
how did you play with it
um it was kind of the same thing
just kind of putting it infront of him and naming it
and then trying to build things
so i guess showing him ho you would use the food in real life
um but you can't
i would have a more difficult time i guess getting creative with that than i would with the animals
yeah
i can see that
did you like build meals and things
i tried to
yeah
they weren't necessarily meals you'd eat together
like waffles and peas you wouldn't put together
but tryin put stuff together
yeah
okay
was he at all interested in the baby doll
he was interested in looking at it
yeah
and he smiled at it
so um and we don't have any dolls at home either
so um i think he he was yeah he was just interested in looking at the face
but he wasn't interested in touching it or anything
okay
does he play play with other infants
maybe
he does play with other infants
yeah
he is in daycare a couple days um a week
so he's with like uh there's six of in a room
including him
oh
and and they all know each other
they've been there f for a while
so he he'll react to those infants
oh
aw
and then the books
we have this one at home
and we have this one at home
um
but these
the two that i read we don't have at home
um but we have a lot of books
we we um go to the library to get the books
so they kinda change differently
so um but normally he really likes those
okay
do you play ever play like pattycake
yeah
yeah we do
um but today you didn't do any like extraneous outside like outside of these toys today
no just the
yeah
but and he just learned how to clap so its its that's uh patty cakes pretty fun for him
and peekaboo
yeah
he loves peeka boo
at home too we do that
and so he sits and list
if you were to say toys versus books here today what do you think
i think he would understand
because we or at least we have like a play area and then we have like a big basket of books
and so whenever he sees us pull out the big basket he'll like shriek
you know that's kind of how he shows happiness right now
and i don't know
maybe it's because we cuddle with him more when we read
and we both will read to him
both my husband and i
um but he seems to get happy and then he'll like shriek while we're reading sometimes too
that's why you know he didn't do that here but normally he really likes it
but he's also just started scooting so he's really interested in moving right now
so
yeah
yeah
um but so at home he it was
i guess you just gave me a comparison
at home he seemed a little bit more interested or excited about books
well yeah we don't just leave them out because their library books
so when we bring out he knows we're going to read to him and then he he gets happy
where as his toys we kinda just leave out
you know so he can get whenever he wants
yeah
okay that makes sense
that's so funny
he's like looking at the baby and saying
what are you eyeing at
it's my clock
yeah
okay well great
i um i think that's it
got through all the questions
okay um now we'll just ask you a few questions
okay
um
okay so let's see
i guess um we're kinda interested in do you think do you like have any of these toys at home
we have books we have little board books
but we don't have any we don't have any of these specific books
well
we've gotten this one from the library before but um i'm not sure if
sofia has ever
that we might've just gotten that for emma i can't remember
um and we have good night but we don't have that size good night
but we don't have any of the other things here
um so do you think that she may have recognized any of the toys
i don't think so
i mean
maybe oh and we have other stuffed animals so maybe she would think that they look similar but they're not like the same as these
i don't think she recognizes them
and then specifically um what toys do you think that she was most interested in
i think she liked the hard plastic stuff a lot
she likes to put it in her mouth and chew on it she seemed to like the keys
um
uh
and i guess those little um apple juice things in the little sippy
and the doll
um
and then do uh do you and your child read books at home
we do but um like i said she usually just grabs it from me and eats it
so um we don't get very far i usually just get to the first page and then she'll start crying if i keep if i try and keep going instead of letting her just have the book
do you think that she would prefer to play with books or toys
um
i think she probably i think toys
um do you think any of the stuffed animals interested her
not really
i mean we have stuffed animals at home and um
she uh likes them kind of but she mostly likes hard plastic toys
um and then i guess specifically of the her plastic toys which ones do you think
she liked the pizza slice and the waffle
um
looks like maybe she likes that cheese
um
and uh that sippy thing
that one with the doll i guess
um and then i noticed that you did point out some of the stuffed animals do you think she's maybe seen them on tv or
well
or just mainly you knew them
yeah i mean
you i'm sorry are you asking did i just point them out 
no no the ones you pointed out do you think it's she's seen them on tv or just because you recognized them
oh i just picked up you know a toy that i saw oh this is from clueless isn't it
kinda looks like the dogs from clueless
how do you
um i mean we have a pooh bear but it's classic pooh
um so it's different than this one and i just picked up the ones that i just saw and i wanted to pick up not because i thought she would like them in particular
yeah
okay
well that's great thank you so much for helping us out and participating
you're welcome
what do you think daniel liked playing with the most today
well he is liking the keys right now
he he loves this book at home
he will i don't know pick it up all the time
and he laughs a lot
and he likes books with the well he likes anything with different textures
i thought he would grab one of these out of my hands but he did not
the one with the animals
do you think he's familar with any of the ones
no
none of them even remotely like anything we have at home
so that's probably it too
the keys we have keys at home so
but not there different
how the um names of any of the animals
do you think
i don't think he would know
uh
maybe maybe uh
no
i don't think he would know any of theses these
maybe a chicken
he might say that occasionally
certainly not an otter
there are two otters
um what about uh so the books at home
yeah we have we have these two
and plenty others
we we read a lot so
he tries to
i dunno
he likes to pick up books and eat them anyway
i don't know if he actually cares about words but
he really likes to pick up that book
i'm sorry
well he likes to pick up books anyway
and his favorite book at home is yellow also
does he do you read a lot of doctor seuss in particular
we just read whatever we have
though he does like this book a great deal
sometimes he laughs just on the first page
do you think he knows what is it called
mister moo
mister brown can moo can you
oh okay
so you do all the sounds when you go through it
anytime that i do like animal noises he laughs
well not any kind anymore
now he's more particular he'll only laugh at the really funny ones but
did you just spit up dan
alright
hold on a second let me get something
but yes he he likes hearing animal noises
i think it's just because it's mom and dad making sounds that we don't usually make that he knows we're not supposed to make
that he recognizes as not normal
do you think you played um similar to how you would at home
um
maybe
he was completely uninterested in all this stuff
he didn't even look at it which was kinda weird
usually if there's an array of toys like this at home he would be diving into four different ones so
i usually wouldn't offer him that many at once
just it would he wouldn't focus on any one thing he would just dive into every separate thing
so he wasn't interested did he play with the food
he didn't even look at it
like it's all within the reach
i mean he you see he was able to reach over and grab the books
and could easily reach forward and grab those i know he can
but he didn't even like look at them
at home
we don't have any of this stuff at home yet
does he play more at home books than toys
no
he'll play with whatever he's got in the room
kind of considers these as his toys also but like
he has i dunno balls and blocks
trains and things
he does have some stuffed animals
they just don't look like these
alright
about the right size though
we do have a couple puppets
but we haven't gotten them out yet
uh what parts of the story
oh you said it was the sound effects
oh yeah
and then um
and the books that have textures
he's just discovering that he can touch the textures
he likes that
do you think he recognizes any of the names of the animals in the book on the farm
no
maybe maybe once he's actually seen some of the animals in person but
i don't think he recognizes them
i think he yeah like i said he recognizes that the sounds are not sounds that people make
mhmm
and so in that sense he knows that there funny
did he want to play with the baby doll today or
i don't know if he's ever even seen one
i mean we don't have siblings and we only have enough toys for his appropriate age
so i don't think
he's just never seen one that i can think of
okay
so his favorite thing uh i think i heard you say was were the books right today
or the keys you said
well yeah right now i would go back to the books
we have that book at home too
the foot book
and his least favorite thing
well i tried even this i tried to pass him this
stuffed animals i would say actually
the stuffed animals would have to be least favorite
least favorite today
there he goes going towards the food
ahhah
yellow i think that he likes yellow
it's fuzzy
so it could be you know um colors and sounds
yeah
alright
could also just be things he's able to pick up
yeah
anything he can put in his mouth right
like i said i would assume that you clean everything between children being here
yeah
but uh yeah
we definitely have to do that
well alrighty
i think that
should i pass you this back
he can keep playing while we talk
okay
you keep chewing on those keys
say there good eatin
so which toys do you think he was most interested here
i think he likes he likes books but he prefers i think the hard toys you can bang and beat and stack
that seems to be what he goes for the most
um which ones were the least interesting
uh probably the doll or the stuffed animals
as he reaches for them
proves me wrong
probably the doll then
he had no interest in the doll
um do you have toys like these at home
yes we have all everything but the doll
books stuffed animals and then all these kinda toys
um do you think that he would prefer to look at a book or play with toys
depends on his mood
probably play with toys more than look at a book
he loses interest in books pretty quickly but
he'll uh he likes the the lift flap books the best
so if you have those then he look at those for a while longer
do you have any of these books at home
yes
we have several of these and then lots of the doctor seuss books
um do you think that there are any items that he would recognize the name of
not yet um
not if you told him to get something he wouldn't find it or look at it
not yet
what about the food items do you think he would know any of those
does he eat any of them at home or
he eats them but they don't look like that
the peas definitely don't look like peas you know
he's still in jar food so
but uh probably not he probably wouldn't recognize you know what they were
um let's see
and you said you don't have dolls at home right
no
is there anything else you
you want the book
think we should know about his play
maybe things he didn't do here or toys that he has at home that he doesn't play with here
uh no not really um
most of his toys are some of them are loud and musical and stuff like that where he has to push buttons to make you know it make music or noises or whatever and
he will do that
where ya goin
you done
uh huh
here
but no most of these are the same type toys we have at home
same things he plays with
what
here you wanna read
you wanna lift the flaps up
peekaboo
is there anything else you think we should know in general
no
not that i can think of
okay we're all done here
okey dokey
alright um
so basically i wanted to ask what you thought she enjoyed the most out of the toys here
i was looking at that i figured you were gonna ask me that and the t som the the toys that resemble food um she kept migrating towards the cookie
and the pizza
and the ice cone
and those things she kept
like this one she she wouldn't wanna didn't wanna put this down
um until she picked up something else and then she kept going back to that one
and so she i think she really
but we we we like coldstone creamery
so we go and take her sister to get ice and she likes ice so maybe that is why she's migrating towards the ice cone
but i noticed the pizza and the cookie
and but anything else i was trying to force it on her and the spaghetti too
um she was messing with the spaghetti
the one that
she had one over here that looked a little bit more like spaghetti
but the ones that have the food
um here we go
um she wouldn't put these down
um this one because of the the weird texture of this
it was sitting here and she was playing with her the other stuff after she had the keys
which she loves keys
i think all babies do
um but this one it moved on its own and it caught her eye
and she was like
i don't think i like that
and so then i moved it over here and she kept staring at it
and then she was like
okay i want to touch it but i don't want to touch it
so it was unknown to her and then like i would i would push it towards her and she showed fear
by moving away from it so i thought that was funny
and it was funny
um because we have a kooshball
i dunno if you know what those are they're but they're they're not as as
yeah yeah not as sticky as
right and so they move a little bit more freely too because they don't stick
and um her sister is terrified of it
she won't touch it she won't pick up and i played an awful trick and threw it at her
and she laughed and picked it up
and she wasn't afraid of the kooshball
but this i think because of the texture um not so much the color but the texture
she's drawn to it
well that's what i was gonna ask you next is why you thought she liked the certain things that she did like
some mothers think it's colo or texture
um and it's interesting that you observed what happened when she saw that move by itself
yeah even still now they're like letting go of the the tentacles are letting go of each other
and um you can't control that so when it's sitting there and it does it it's like
wait a minute why did that move i want to touch that
how these other stuffed animals
i just trying to get her to touch the stuffed animals and she'd look at it but okay
p pooh uh her nanna loves pooh so um she's she looked at it a little bit but
um so maybe it was more familiar to her but the other stuffed animals no
she liked this one
she she put this one in her mouth i think it was because of the stripes
the striped hat
and the duck you know i go to give her a kiss and
eh nothing
but the baby
she did like the baby
and she was looked like she was trying to hug the baby
and i don't know if it was coincidence or not but she had the bottle in her hand
and um so when i gave her the baby she put the baby down picked up the bottle
put the bottle down
it looked like she was trying to coordinate her hands to to do whatever she wanted to do with the baby and the bottle
i don't think it was to feed it but i think she might associate the bottle with
now she's mainly breastfed um and it's i stay at home with her now i'm not um i'm you know i took a year off from teaching to be with her
and so it's very rare that she has to be bottlefed unless i have um you know something i have to do when she's with my mother
or her uh her n my mother in law
so they'll occasionally use a bottle but she's skipping straight to the bottle and going to the cup
but she didn't want to play with this one
do you think she would recognize that as something familiar
well yeah she should've because uh but maybe n maybe not with the top because she's she's busy she doesn't want the top she wants
at her tongue
like you pick up a cup and she goes
that's give me the cup
i don't want the bottle
i don't want anything
i want your cup
i want what you have in your cup
so um she's not but she put this in her mouth
she did definitely knew what this was so
that looked familiar
and some of the food you think may look familiar too
yeah
well w ca uh h her dad and uh sister had pizza the other night
um i do cook spaghetti so i'm not sure if um it's because it's familiar
but she definitely keeps putting the food
nothing else really she was putting in her mouth
she didn't put the stuffed animals in her mouth
well she puts the keys in her mouth that's what she does for everything all her play keys but
like nothing else you know most of the time when she's trying to figure something out she puts it in her mouth
but mainly if it was a food toy she put the food and the toy in her mouth
she didn't put the
well she tried to eat the baby
and she keeps going to
and i think the baby looks like her
you know
i'm trying to get to know the baby
and was she interested in the books at all
no
no books
no even though we i read with her sister everyday you kn
mommy can you read this to me
i wanna read to qwynniebear
and we uh you know doing word recognition with her her sister
but she's not showing interest yet
so you would say that probably the books were the least interesting today
yeah yeah i i picked this one up and
nothing
you know yeah she too much other stuff going on
she wasn't really interested in it
i think she looked at it i think because of the colors
maybe the face on it but
but nothing else
um she did i was when i said i i recognized i'd answered incorrectly
um i'm not sure if i did or not but she actually picked the two up and was able to tap she tapped them together
and i'm not sure if i answered that correctly on the que on the
als i'll look for it
yeah if she's able to tap them together
um and and then as far as the names of some of these things like the food
would do you think she would recognize names
maybe maybe not
but i do you a you know whatever i do i always verbalize what i'm doing
i'm getting you a cup now
you know i want her to develop lang her sis sister developed speaking very early and um
has none stop despite i think shh i think she has a stutter
um i'm not sure
it's because all kids do it at this age
trying their brain is working trying to figure out what they want to say
but with her um i'm probably more sensitive to it because her father has a stutter
and so i
you know i'm just probably more on edge about it because
just give her some time
yeah when we have a very good friend who's a speech therapist
and um he said don't worry about it until she's four
if she's still doing that and um getting hung up on her like her w and her her y then um address it
but for now don't even worry about it and she has a lisp
but it's just with s you know like snake
she's young
and she is young and when i say micah say ss and she'll do it
she can do it
it's just a matter of her being in such a hurry
right and she's probably used to do doing it the other way
so i'm not g i'm not worried about it
but um if qwynn does the same thing you can't
i think stuttering has to be hereditary
well they know now that that that's at least a component of it
yeah
yeah it has to be
because what are the odds
i just read in the paper about they identified some genes that um are related to stuttering
really
still looking for some more but yeah but there are some genes that um contribute to stuttering
so we know that at least that's one factor
and maybe it takes more than that to to really cause a person to stutter
yeah i don't know my husband had a blood clot when he was a a baby
and they actually sent him home to
told his mom to make his arrangements
for burial because he wasn't going to make it
and one of the most intellectual people i know today
you can't tell me that he was supposed to die
you know
but that's just um
and he and she says that that's where uh they say that's where the stuttering came from
and i don't think so
i think if you're tw
it happened to him when he was eighteen months or two years old something like that
but if you're that young you haven't even developed the speech yet
so how do you know
you know
you you can say momma and dadda
which you know
but how do you know that you weren't going to stutter before the blood clot
you don't know and so i'm just i just listen
yeah i file it away
you're smart you are that's exactly
it's one one battle i'm not gonna fight
but i know as a mother you know and and as a teacher
i teach sixth sixth grade and i taught fifth for several years and i've come across my fair share of stuttering students
and um it does not have to hinder their um cognitive abilities or their learning or you know their even their participation in class
i just you know it doesn't have to be that way
as long as they feel they don't feel ashamed
yeah it shouldn't be any
but um i think that um if if it comes down to it she's definitely in the right place you know with you all i think
she is
and i put that on there so if you all come across any studies for micah's age group that would be great too
you know just give us a call
we'll gladly bring her in
and if you do become concerned about like when she's four
you you have your friend so that's a resource
and if you ever wanted to get her evaluated here at the clinic they do that here too
oh
so um you can just make an appointment and have her evaluated
oh
we actually have um on the faculty here one of the i mean most well known people who work with stutterers
okay
um and so she would be part of that evaluation
that would be good to know
that's good to know
yeah she's great yeah they have two um fluency groups that meet here that are adults um stutterers
oh
so there's a pretty strong
actually our department chair too is um her background is in fluency too
so so that's a very strong piece of the department here
so yeah but she your daughter's young and but if you ever did want to have her evaluated that you could come here
yeah
yeah i will i'll keep that in mind
use your friend
well charles is excellent
he he works with howard at howard university too so he's
yeah so there they probably have
yeah they're not as extensive as maryland i would imagine but um
yeah so you have you know what to do
definitely
oh yeah oh yeah
now as far as qwynn um we have a lot of
hi
we have a lot of information that you um provided and we're gonna ask you ea at each visit to fill out
and i know that a lot of it is gonna be the same but she will change over time so um you'll see that
oh yeah she'll grow and develop
each time we have a play session it's gonna be these toys so we'll see if
if her interests change
if her interests change if the way she explains the toys change
anything like that so it'll be just like this
okay
and um
and it's over the course of four visits so that means she'll be
she'll be
this is the seven month visit then we'll do around ten months around eleven months and then at two years
and the two year visit is a little different
there will be a play session but they'll be some um some evaluations and assessments and then we'll be able to give you some information on her that way when she's two
that'll be fun
it's fun to
yeah it is and to see the the change and the progression
alright well we are all done and i can take your microphone
okay
go 
so what do you think that she um enjoyed the most
she really liked this pully stretchy hair on this guy
she loved that
i think just because she's really into right now just like feeling and pulling and really exploring stuff like that
she likes books
um she lik she loves pooh bear so she liked that
she likes the animals a lot
do you have um pooh at home
yeah
yeah
so yeah it's her she got it for christmas so
and it's it looks it's a little bit bigger than this
so it looks pretty identical to that
yeah i was surprised she didn't like the puppet more she usually likes puppets but she wasn't really interested in that
um what el oh she loved playing she loved the baby
she was kissing it and loving it and
which surprised me she has babies at home but it must be the size of this one
she doesn't have one this big or this life like looking
she slobbered al still wet with slobber
so she loved that so that was kinda neat to see
whoops
put the thing on
yeah sorry
here honey
alright
alright
okay
alright there you go
there you go
this just clips
that is funny
oh
that's all it takes
okay
alright
okay so you said she was she likes to play with she does play with babydolls at home
yeah she has them
but like i said one's a cabbage patch a small cabbage like mini cabbage patch
it's about this big
and the other is um just like a it's a a doll with like yarn hair and like a stitched on face and stuff so it doesn't look nearly as life like as that one
so she really liked that one
aw
and so so she played with it like kissing it
yeah she was kissing it and just
i mean i played peekaboo with her at first and she liked that and then when she saw it she just kissed it all over
and she loves these little keys
she's teething right now so anything little shh keys like this anything she chews up but
and she lik she liked these t she she liked mostly everything
was there something that you uh gave her that she didn't like
this this aggravated her
because she couldn't she tried to drink from it and she couldn't
so this is upset her
so
does she drink from a bottle
only a little bit at night some formula
she'll get a little bit of formula at night
so she's used to the bottle
okay
so she knows what's in the bottle
so i thought this was funny that she this made her mad
but um otherwise she well i showed her something she just was not interested in at all
it was one of the stuffed animals
oh the zebra she didn't care about at all
this the seal she really didn't either
forgot about the spaghetti
she loved the spaghetti
did she
yes
she loved that so
is it is that a name that's familiar to her
i mean we have spaghetti a lot
but so
i thought that was interesting
but it's also i think the maybe the color or the feeling the texture of it
may have reall she really liked that but
yeah
was there anything here that you think that she's like never heard of or never seen before
oh
oh yeah
um let me think
like the um i don't think she's ever seen a seal like this before for sure
um we don't have a toy otter
although i've talked about otters to my so not to her though so she hasn't really seen otters much
um and the meat
like she hasn't seen like she hasn't seen toy like food before we don't have any toy food yet
okay
so she hasn't seen any of that but she liked it
um so yeah
okay
and then did you does at home does she prefer toys or books
she prefers toys
yeah she just eats books basically right now
so
and did you find that she was a did you read books in here
yeah like um we have this one at home and this on
we read books a lot at home
because of ga i mean gabe loves books
and so she's always reading with us
but i have to keep her like off of them she'll chew them up
that's all she just wants to like rip at them and chew them right now
so she'll look at them for a little bit but she really likes this one
they both love mister brown
the noises and they like put me too
so
um and this one she i just noticed today actually she would this one she'd actually paid more attention to it than she normally would
so with the animals
which was good
do you have that one at home
we don't have this one
oh okay
no
but just we have lots of animal books and stuff but this one she she really paid attention longer than normal for this for like that type of book
so
was it do you think because of the ducks or the name of the ducks or the feel
she the feel she started f actually feeling it
i i've been asking her like when we read the books okay feel here and stuff and she wouldn't
she just would like try to grab it and eat it
so i think she's actually maybe starting to understand what she's supposed to do
not just eat it
yeah
it's a process
so
it is yeah
yeah
so um
were there any like um do you have pretend food at home
no we don't have any yet
which is like i just haven't ever haven't bought it yet
um but she really liked it so
oh my gosh she has she pulled this over
it's okay for us i just uh if she chews on it
yeah
she um she really seemed to like it
she was chewing on i dunno this i think it's a piece of meat i don't even kno
and like i said the spaghetti
um so we don't have any of that at home
she liked the cookie too
so
okay
yeah
does she eat any of those foods or
no not yet
no she hasn't even i mean she hasn't had like a full sized anything like this
she's had like a bit of like i break off crackers and give it to her but she hasn't had anything like this
but her brother has cook we like we made cookies today
oh okay
like she knows what cookies are
oh she does
she just can't eat them
yeah
i mean we have cookies in the house and stuff so
that's i think she she saw that
well it's probably it's probably the colors too
she wanted to chew on that maybe
but she liked that
and she liked the i don't know where it went
oh this
the mystery meat
yeah
so
um yeah
yeah this though the hair
like i said this she really liked
we definitely don't have anything like this at home
does she the word or does she use the word
do you use the word bee
bee yes
especially right now we have bees all over the yard so we've been watching the bees and avoiding the bees and everything so
but i don't know i mean we don't have a stuffed bee at home at all but um yeah
okay
so
um i thought i had one more
i had so if you had to pick a favorite toy today what do you think it would be
i think it's a toss up she loved this and but i think this really
oh no she loved the baby too
i would say the baby just because she loved ripping at this but just the way she interacted with the baby
she the way she was kissing it and really just like and loving it
that i think was her favorite thing
so
like she yeah it wasn't just like something to teethe on or something she really liked it
you know
yeah
so
and did you find that this is how she plays at home
yeah oh yeah
she just goes from one thing to the next like grabbing at everything tasting everything and
that's what she does
trying to chew on it
but like yeah she just moves from one thing to the next and we just like we do the very similar not as many toys but we set out different ones and i just pull out different things for her
to like change it up and then
and it's usually she does go after her brother's toys so she plays with trucks a lot
so so um
but yeah but that's basically this is basically what she does without as much like concentration
okay
of things
but
and now she's she's just started to crawl so she can move herself around to things that she wants
so um she has more options now too
but yeah
that's good you can see what she's more interested in
she really likes that b i have to get her her own little baby
aw it's cute
yeah you have a baby
yes you do
a baby of your own
she's like i've been my brother's baby
yeah haven't you
she's funny
you're funny
she really likes that
that's really neat
look what you have
i see you
oh yeah
we see what you have
she's just showing off for you
just a few questions for you
yeah
okay let's see
which toys did he seem the most interested in
definitely the play food
okay
any items of the play food in particular
uh the spoon
and the plate
why do you think that was
um he likes to pick up objects and turn them in his hands i think those are like a good size for him
and they also um we don't have anything like that at home
so maybe it's just you know i mean we have spoons but we don't have like play food and play spoons for him
we mostly have like soft toys and books
and teethers
which toys did he seem the least interested in
um i'd say the soft toys
and why do you think that was
um maybe just they're familiar or um
i don't think he sees them as something to play with yet maybe or they don't go in his mouth
he likes to put a lot of things in his mouth
so i think maybe the rubber kinda plastic feeling
he likes
um at home do you ever read books to him
yeah
i see it do you have any of these books
um we have one like this that has where you know he touches the animals
and we have good night moon at home
okay um would you say he prefers books over toys or toys over books
um i think toys over books
like he'll pay attention when we read bedtime stories and he seems you know kinda interested but when he's awake during the day i think he prefers toys
do you think there are any items that he recognizes the names for
uh i don't think so
from these which ones do you think he's never seen before what items do you think he's never seen before
or heard before the names for
um prob not like ice cone pizza any of the foods um we don't have play food and we just started him on solids so he only really knows you know spoon
so those are prob new
um do you have any of the toys at home any of similar or same items i know you said you mentioned the book
yeah the books um and we have like a little soft toys but none of them are the same
are there some similar animals
um we do have frogs
yeah
and you say you don't have pretend food at home
no
what about dolls does he every play with dolls
no he doesn't play with dolls
and i think that's all we have for you today
okay
so the next visit will be when he is ten months so we'll get more when he is ten months and more when he is eleven months
okay
we'll be calling you for those
okay
and i think that might
i'm just gonna ask you a couple quick questions
um so which of these toys you think interested her most
i think the
the bumblebee
the little bee
why do you think that is
she seemed to cling on to it more than all the other objects
is there any other type of toy that you think that she liked a lot
um
she might've liked the ice a little bit
what about the other kinds of foods
the others i think the pizza
i think those are yeah i think the pizza
what about any of the utensils
is it the spoon or is it
think
saw her with this
this
yes
are there any utensils that she'll play with like on the kitchen floor at home or something
or anything you'll give her to play with
um
keys or something
she has something can't think of what it is it sits on her high chair
she uh
kind of like that
i can't think of it it's like it it's similar to this it's but it's it spins around
okay
it's a little um gadget
that came with her high chair
i can't even think what it looks like
but i know it spins around
alright
are there any foods that she may recognize or see at home more often
uh she probably would recognize
peas
the sweet potatoes
the colors
like the orange and um
like a yellowish mustard like color for her
no sweets yet
no no
no sweets
um what do you think interested her the least
i would
i probably the dollbaby probably it was too big
it's like her size
yeah so i don't think
and what about any of the stuff over there on that side
um
oh i don't i don't think she was too she wasn't too enthused about this
kept droppin it so
the bottle
yes she wasn't consumed with that
um
what does she drink out of at home now
the bottle
so
so no cups yet either
no cups
no
um
does she have any of these books at home
she has um
no not any of these she has
she has a couple we read to her at night
bedtime stories
she likes
you know songs so she's pretty much she's attentive to you know when we sing to 
she kinda likes to be sung before she goes to bed
mkay alright
i think we're all done here
lately
mkay
thank you so much
okay you're welcome
let me get the microphone
thank you
you're welcome
participant six two zero six m p and this was the first visit
is it okay if i ask you some questions
sure
so what do you think um haylie
do you call her haylie or any other nickname
we call her haylie or haylie bug
aw
yeah
no but haylie is yeah
oh okay
what do you think haylie liked to play with the most today
um well it seems to be the clock
really
well i mean she chews on everything she likes so
i'd say clock or yeah pretty much
probably the clock is best
she didn't seem that interested in the babydoll which is surprises me
you tried to play with does it does she play with it at home
uh she has a soft one
okay
but this one's looks completely different so
her her doll at home is her favorite toy so
how does she play with it at home
uh she'll like give it hugs and when as soon as she see's it she'll like squeal with delight
she loves she loves the doll so
i'm surprise that's why i was pushing this one we never gotten her one of these before
were you trying to get her to play with it in similar ways today
yeah
i mean normally at home we don't have to push the other doll on her she likes it so much but yeah um
i was probably pushing it more than i would at home so
that makes sense
um did you try to get into any of the
oh uh you had mentioned books are not
she's not a big fan of books yet i have a million at home
and i try every day to read to her and we
unless they have things to feel she doesn't seem that interested
so
we try though
she liked that book
she didn't go for it
no
she wouldn't go for that one
she look she listened for about a page of that peekaboo book
and she perked up when i said peekaboo we do that at home so
oh cool
but other than that she didn't seem very interested
yeah
do you um does she recognize the names of animals
or do you think she's familiar do you do a lot of like animal names at home
um the ones around the house yes
and i've tried like she knows bunny
she knows a few
none of the ones in this book
like she has the things she has stuffed animals we name at home a lot but
we don't mention any of these other animals in here so
yeah
do you have any like similar stuffed animals at home
um we have we have a bunny we have dogs we have
not nothing like not none of these
like we don't have one of the an otter
we have like pooh bear and things
but nothing we don't s like label them
we don't have ones that have specific labels like zebra
we just have basic animals like dog and bunny and bear
and you like you la you give them human names
we i always attach like if we name it for her we have the name and then we like bella the
you know we always like attach both to it so she so she begins to learn the the name of it i guess
yeah
so
yeah
with the same sound you mean
yeah
or i mean we call one of her dogs abby but it's sort of a joke of ours
but yeah we do say the dog so
okay
how did she um so out of all the toys what do you think was her least favorite
um she didn't seem to become interested in any of the stuffed toys that i offered her
so probably the stuffed toys
in general
she seemed pretty interested in all the various food
i guess the books
would be more likely
yeah
i guess she was least interested in the books
do you think um any of the food looks familiar or are names that she's heard in your house
um like for the
she's only had peas out of all of this
so she recognized that i i always tell her what i'm feeding her
so and it's usually a fruit or veggie
so yeah that would probably be the only one she recognizes besides like the bottle
oh okay
so
is she still drinking out of the bottle or are you trying to
we're transitioning to a sippy for her
oh okay
yeah
yeah but she's catching on quickly so
you are just moving around aren't you
you've never seen pizza
yeah that's a new one
uh sometimes sitting all in a pile of toys being surrounded by toys is more fun than actually playing with them
yes
it's like
yes
i don't think she's ever been surrounded by this many toys before
it was a little hard to f make her focus on one i think
so
yeah i can imagine
you like that peanut though huh
yeah
does she usually like uh spoons and
what kind of toys does she play with a lot at home
um she has a lot of the shapes and um
i mean i let her i let her play with a spoon when i'm getting ready to
like one of her spoons
to so when i'm getting her food ready so that she can sort of figure out how to hold it eventually
we're not teaching her that yet but we're just letting her sort of play with it
but um she has a lot of like i said shapes and a lot of interactive toys
like with noise and a lot of those little tykes toys
she pushes things or pulls it
like her one of her favorite is one of those tables and you have to do different things like pull the lever or spin the thing
turn the page
she really likes those
anything that she can sort of get a reaction out of by doing some sort of action
yeah
yeah
otherwise she does this
she just sort of
right
yeah
you are so busy
how do you generally um get her attention
uh just call her name or sometimes we have to make silly noises
so
and she's but if she doesn't want to look away from what she's doing she won't
there's no
she is single minded
like when she's doing something and doesn't want to be interrupted there's there's no chance
so yeah we call her name or make a silly noise or say look
and other than that's pretty much it
uhoh
there she goes
well we're done
oh honey
that's the only thing you can't play with in here
yeah
doing well
okay so i'd just like to ask you a few questions
sure
uh tell me about what you played with first
the doll i think is the first thing she saw that she liked
the baby doll
you like this
what else did she see
uh the ice cream and the hamburger were exciting
some of the foods
we looked at the clocks some books
the peas the peanut
the bottle we played with the bottle with the baby
all new toys this is what we have to do at home
did you show her any other foods
the pizza i think we did the pizza
i don't think we did any of those besides the peas
so we did the peas the hamburger the
do you like peas madison
you like peas
i hope you always like peas
me too
i don't like peas
and my parents tried to make me eat peas and it didn't work
so its good that you like them
what do you think of that
um did you show her any of the utensils did she seem interested in any of them
we really didn't play much with that no
oh
i mean she put her ice in here a couple times
oh that's your plate huh
yeah
does she eat off that yet
uh sometimes at a restaurant i might put a couple of her little puffs on it and then have to hold it down if not it's just a
you know we fly everything around at this point
yeah
you like to put on a show when you eat huh
did you show her any of the animals
yeah we used this little puppet guy i'm not sure if it a
i think its a bunny isn't it
i don't know whatever it is
it's either a bunny or
or a bear
or a kangaroo
oh kangaroo makes sense
maybe
some of these animals are a little unclear
i was like i'm not sure what to call you but we'll call you a bunny
um so we did this for a couple seconds
and i'm trying to think if we did any other ones
i don't think we really did any of the other ones
what kind of toys is she particularly interested in at home
um she loves to play with the food in her sister's toy kitchen um not unlike this stuff here that she's playing with today
oh yeah
um we do a lot of books she has a ton of books
um those little sorter things like she doesn't sort them yet but she likes to play with the squares and triangles and circles
yeah
she likes her little soft blocks that we i make the tower
she likes to you know knock it down
dolls you know
which books did you read to her today
um we did good night moon
and we did just a couple crazes pages of put me in the zoo
i usually sort of when i'm reading to her if she starts to do something else i kind of let her do her own thing and then come back and
yeah
you're going to be a big reader some day aren't you
you shouldn't eat the book silly
no eat books
okay well that'll all done
okay
wonderful
what first
oh man um
i guess some of the food
the spoons we played with first
um and then i guess we read a little bit of the goodnight moon book
and the she picked some more of the food
mostly she seemed to like the ice cone
what did you play with after that
um after the ice cone
i guess we started playing i gave her some other things
like the peas oh and she oh and she liked the frog
you liked that too
um
what made you guys do
um she had the spoon then she came over here
and she was playing a little bit like the plate and the spoon over here
oh i read her that book earlier too
and then
what like reading
or
oh this
which thing
the book
we have like there's it's not this one
but she has like three other ones that are kinda similar so i read those to her
i just do peek a and stuff like that
um and then
what else did we do lexie
then she was rolling around a little bit
um did you eat any other food over there
she played with the measuring spoons
and played with the clock a little bit
um and i guess that's about it
she looked at mister brown
which is something we read with her brother but
you eating your fingers silly girl
yeah
aw
um there was one other food i saw that she was interested in
oh um
the breakfast food
oh the waffle
i forgot that
so do you have pretend food at home
you know what
we have a little bit but she doesn't have it
she doesn't have it its in the basement
and she normally doesn't go down there
um just because we only have like one chicken drumstick and that's it
so
maybe we should get you some fake food
what was she not interested in
um she didn't really seem very interested in the stuffed animals
except for the frog
but she didn't really go for that and she didn't seem interested in the doll
does she have a doll at home
she actually does but her doll is more a stuffed animal than a doll
baby or my first babydoll
it's a stuffed animal that looks like a doll
so
it's soft and everything
um
what other books um that were here um did you own
um we have the foot
we have versions of this
we have good night
not the one two but we've got the
we have books that are sort of like this that are you know tactile
or whatever you would call it
um
we don't have that one
but we have lots of books i mean i read to her everyday
so
oh you okay
are you okay
we're all done thank you so much
okay great
thank you
alright lexie
enjoy your day
say bye bye toys we'll see you
you can stop now
he can keep playing if he wants
okay
while we we chat
sure
he got kinda ang he gets really angry when i take things away from him
that's okay
that we really wants like paper and the remote control
okay
so which toys do you think he was most interested in
um toys that make sounds
and toys that he could put in his mouth
okay why do you think that he likes those
um because he's pretty active and he likes to clang things around
so shake his arm and throw things
so that's just been my observation that's what he gravitates to normally
an that and things that he isn't allowed to have
okay which ones do you think he was least interested in
um he wasn't really interested in what i was doing with the food
um the baby
yeah
um did you look at any of the books we had
which ones
um we were reading mister brown
and do you have any of these at home
yeah um we have that one at home
we haven't looked at it in a few months though
i think i don't actually know where it is right now
do you think in general he prefers books or toys
um hi
i think it depends
he likes to play with the books
like when we try to we try to read him um books every night as part of our going to bed routine
and he always is trying to grab them and play with them instead of reading for the most part
um so i guess it just
he kind of alternates between playing with the toys
like if we were at home and he had the option he would kind of take one and then the other
it's not like i think he exclusively prefers one or the other
um do you have a babydoll at home or
um no not we have more stuffed animals
um we don't have a babydoll like that
yeah so that's kind of the first time i think he's seen a doll like that
um and do you think he would recognize the names of any of these items
um books
book definitely
um i don't know
probably not anything else actually
uh sippy maybe
we've just started using that
um recently
so maybe book and sippy
and any of the animals
um maybe bumblebee
maybe winnie the
maybe the rooster
um do you have similar toys at home or do you have
um we don't really have uh i don't the stuffed animals that we have he doesn't play like i don't um generally give to him to play with
um we don't have any of the food
we have little rattles and things
um we have the books
that's about it
are there other toys at home that he likes to play with that we don't have here
um yeah he likes um he likes um things that have um crinkly cellophane in them
he has some like teething toys that are like stuffed with plastic parts and things
and he has little trucks that he like fisher price dump truck kinda thing that he likes
and there's a toy called a whoozit
which has like um it's black and white on one side and the other side has a little face on it
you're just into it aren't you
um
is there anything else you think we should know about his play skills things we didn't see here or is this typical of how he plays
um yeah it typi like he likes to he likes shaking things that make noise he likes
doing that when he's really excited
okay
is there anything else that you think we should know
i don't think so
alright
well we're all done then
um so tell me about how you guys played and what you played with
what we played with
it looked like she gravitated to the food items and i think because of the colors
she really likes the colors
and maybe the soft texture of it
but it was hard enough to bite on it she's teething so
she kept going after these little slices of pizza she liked that a lot
um i kept trying to introduce her to the different stuffed toys
she wasn't interested at first
she had to do that first
and then after a while she was kind of okay with the bumblebee
and she liked him because he was having interaction with her and kissing her and bumping up against her
and we do that a lot at home with stuffed toys
and we read a lot but she likes to eat the pages so
she got frustrated with me
because she wasn't able to eat the page
and that you saw she was getting a little fussy because of that
but normally we do
we sing the abc song like all day long
so she's familiar with that when she hears it
she hops her head up
and sometimes she plays in her uh play pen at home
and i just throw a bunch of things in there and she just kinda plays with them independently
so i'm used to she's not used to me playing like this much with her this long
i think i i com i'm irritating her a little bit
she'd rather just do her own thing
that's kinda her personality
are any of the food items familiar um things from home
they have playfood at home it's not these items specifically
but she doesn't really play with those they're in our play room and she's too small to really go in there so i don't she may have seen them before though
but she doesn't they're not the same stuff
they're a little harder
they're more like this
the plastic one
they're thicker
do you use some of the names at home
um the names of the food at home
pizza
she's probably heard us talking about pizza night or whatever she has a brother that loves pizza
and
uh that goes to mommy's
you have all these toys and you want the microphone
um i mean she's not really eating a lot of things yet but she's probably heard us talking t about them and then i'm saying them as we're playing like spaghetti and ice
um what about is she starting to use like um forks and spoons
no she's eating with her fingers she's eating finger foods a lot
she eats like cheerios and fruit puffs and stuff like that
um
but she's familiar she's watched this show on tv with her siblings
the word word word world i think it's called
so this is probably looks a little familiar with her
does she know that the animal names
some of them or would they be familiar with to her
zebra
maybe
i mean i'm sure she's heard it before on the shows
any of the other animals she might be familiar with
she well we talk we have a book where we name all the animals in the book that we read at home
so she's probably heard dog before
um bumblebee
that's why i grabbed these two
mostly because of their color but she's she's seen those before
um she's familiar with winnie the
and she knows about hello kitty
because her entire bedroom is decorated that way
she's never seen it in yellow though
she might not totally know that that's hello kitty yet
uhoh
uhoh sweetie pie
and then i heard you were playing with the food kind of like imaginary play
um is that something that you do at home
i do that with everything
with her at home
um and everything i typically if i have her on my hip when we're walking around the house and doing different things i'm naming everything i'm picking up
okay
so she starts to get familiar with spoon
when i was holding the spoon i kept saying it
and the daughter that's two actually was talking at twelve months very very fluently
like you could understand everything and she was really clear
and it's probably because i did that with her
so
she's kinda saying some things already
this one
that's exciting
so she'll probably be that way as well
kennipoo i can't have you put it in your mouth and go fer far back in your mouth you're gonna choke sweet pea
how did you decide um what to make to use for the imaginary play like the objects
i was watching her
you know just seeing what she kept gravica gravitating to
she wanted the food
i kept introducing the books and she's like not right now
and i tried to bring a t stuffed toy and she would like not really pay much attention to it
now she's a little more open i think
she's u she's bored with the food i think
so now she's looking at the other stuff
but i was following her lead
which food items were her favorite
i think the pizza
um she picked up the spaghetti a little bit
and then the ice cone
and she gnawed on it
i hope these are clean
yeah we actually clean um after every visit
okay
and she liked the cookie
it probably because of the colors
and it was easy to pick it up
were you um bringing in other names for what they could be
certain things
just kind of like
i called what they are
yeah okay
yep
i want her to learn it the right way
i told her that these were both spaghetti even though i'm not sure if they are
one looks totally different than the other one but
kennedy honey that's you keep going after and you can't have that
that's gonna get jabbed in your throat
how about the books
which ones did you
i was trying to show her this yellow one she likes yellow she tends to gravitate to the color yellow s it's nice and bright and cheerful i think
and she touched the little fur for a second
but she's her attention span when reading is not quite there
so we can get through a couple of pages but she really just wants to eat it
and and play with the pages
so that's usually what i let her do with books
but i read every night to the other ones and she's usually sitting right there
sometimes she's really attentive to it
she's actually listening
at least it looks like it
do you have any of the same books at home
um i have a lot of doctor seuss books i don't have that one though
i think i the foot looks familiar
and i have a book very similar to this one on the
it's not quite this one but it's very similar to this
and it's got the thick pages like that
this is the first time i've seen the peekaboo book that's cute
but she would rip this one
it's not really thick
but
how did she do with it today
she did fine i got through it but she kept trying to you know eat the pages
was there a page that she maybe you thought or she did think was particularly exciting
she liked this curtain page
and maybe because it split in two and she could grab it easier
this one
she didn't really care what was under it she was more or less con interested
uhoh i'm sorry honey
she was more or less concerned about the actual
hey sweetie
are you enjoying yourself
huh
are you enjoying yourself
what ya think baby girl
you're probably getting a little hungry huh
you call her a couple different names right
other than i mean just like nick names sweet names
you know it's just natural i don't even know what i'm calling her half the time
sweet pea honey
pumpkin
kennipoo
mostly kennipoo
don't you
you think that's your name don't you
you think kennipoo's your name
babydoll
i did not even pick up the babydoll
i thought she might be afraid of it it's kinda big
i didn't even see this one actually
yeah this is as big as you
you like it
you think it's another baby
yeah
you like to pull hair there you go
yeah
you say why is she letting me do this
yeah that's a that's a very fun thing that she's just letting you do everything you wanna do
you like her hair
yeah you like her eyes aren't they pretty
does she have pretty eyelashes
oh you bless y god bless you
you sneezed in the baby's face
say excuse me
excuse me
so if you had to pick um like her favorite thing today uh to play with what do you think it wa
or things it doesn't necessarily have to be one but
she seems very interested in this one
maybe i should have pulled out the babydoll sooner
she liked that bumblebee
yeah
yeah she seemed to have a lot of reaction to it once she finally decided she was going to be okay with stuffed toys
but she liked the
kennedy okay honey you're pulling her hair out
look at you took the baby's hair out
kennipoo
you took her hair out
oh it's okay
she's alright honey
it's alright
it's okay
you wanna still play with her
so you held the bee and you were you were pretend playing with the bee like the bee was kissing her
buzz
that's not mommy's
you have hair all over the place little one
poor little babydoll
handle the bee like uh do anything i dunno
i think she bit his nose
she tried to kiss him or whatever she does with him
she has this thing with faces
what's wrong you're getting hungry
you're getting hungry
um what would you say was something you were trying to get her that she was was her least favorite thing
her least favorite thing
probably these toys words
these um she wasn't interested in pooh today which was surprising
she didn't want that
she was really not really all that interested in the books
other than wanting to bite them
yeah
what do you want to play with
does she have like a favorite color
she likes yellow
she definitely likes yellow
and that seems to be what she's gravitated to even today
yeah
are there any colors that you find that she doesn't gravitate toward
her least favorite
um i dunno i never really paid attention to that
okay
um okay i think that's it for today
are you still eating your plates
okay
so i have a few questions to ask you
sure
ah what did you all play with first
i think she picked up the frog first
okay
after the frog what else did she play with
a cookie
and then the pizza slices i think
okay
keep going
yeah go 
oh just should i just list everything
yeah that would really be helpful
i don't remember at all exactly in the order that she played but um
uh the plastic spoons
okay
the waffle pieces
um i thought that she would like the puppet but she seemed less interested in the puppet today
did she recognize that
um
wh
the puppet
the kangaroo
yeah
do i recognize it
does she recognize it
i don't think so
okay
i don't think um she seem she likes a lot of puppet things which is why i thought she'd be into it
okay
but um maybe she's not interested in the stuffed animals actually because we don't really give her stuffed animals to play with
just because we have cats and the cats have stuffed animals
and it helps to delineate between what is a cat toy and what is a people toy or the cats get very confused about what they're allowed to carry around with them so
oh okay
there you now you like the puppet but you don't actually want me to puppet with it huh no
um she really likes the plastic food pieces and the spoon
uh and she wants well she wants to chew on everything because she hasn't gotten her first tooth yet
so
aw
um and she's been workin on it for like months
so uh it should be here soon right
yeah
yeah
does she have pretend food at home
uh no
she does not
um
we have like a lot of sea creatures for some reason
everyone gave us sea creatures as like toys
ah so we have lots of octopuses and sea horses and things
um
well and then like all that fisherprice stuff is all baby animals so there's lots of baby animals
okay
this is sp now you're playing with the spaghetti you didn't like the spaghetti before
what other food to have doe does she play with
uh well she played with like multiple pieces of pizza at once
and then the plates
okay
but she didn't do she i think she cause she likes the smaller ones she didn't really seem interested in like the big ones
i didn't offer her them but she didn't really seem interested
and like the this was like kinda heavy i think for her so she n now you want it
you're strange sometimes
oh
what you tryin put that in your mouth
d you think she um recognizes wh what's in that cup
ah yeah i dunno if she recognizes what's in it
but the sippy cup she definitely seemed cause she didn't she tried to like suck on it
and she has a sippy cup which she sucks on
um she also she feeds herself at home
so um but i don't think that she was like trying to eat the food i think she's just too busy trying to put everything in her mouth because that's what she does
but the sippy cup it did seem like she was like trying to actually use it as a sippy cup
as opposed to like the bottle when she picked up she was like chewing on the nipple of the bottle
but that's because she's never really used a bottle she kinda went straight to the sippy cup
okay
ah cause i nurse her so
okay
uh now you're like godzilla
you rollin around in the stuff roar oh yeah she wants this wire
she really likes wires and tries to chew on all the wires at home
that's interesting
well
her father and i are both have like multiple laptops in the living room and so she's constantly scooting over to where like the power adapters are so
um she has her own private u s cable that she's allowed to chew on instead of our power cables because i'd rather have her chew on something that's not hooked up to anything
right see
you don't even care say what is that thing
that's a baby doll
but you don't have any baby dolls and yeah
it has very cute shoes though
what stuffed animals did she play with
uh
i thought she'd like the the word world ones but she just mostly the frog
the sea otter she seemed to think is that what it is was cute
the keys uh she liked the keys
okay
you picked this one up these were
yeah
yeah but she didn't i dunno
didn't seem that interested in them so
well now you're puttin on a whole show huh
what are you doin with this baby
huh
are you attacking that baby
you're licking that baby's head
um has she seen this toy before
no
we have lots of eeyores we actually don't have any pooh stuff
so she's not familiar with pooh right
you don't have pooh but you know eeyore
and has she seen these animals before if this is the word but
uh we've wa watched that show a couple times but mostly she's hardcore into sesame street so
i think if you had had like big bird or something she would really recognize that
she's really likes and um oh there's a character on sprout this chicken that like she gets visibly excited when she sees this particular chicken
it has a squeaker in it and it goes like coo and then she gets like really excited if it's even an advertisement for it
um but they don't merchandise things so
what you're pokin that baby's eye out
um
what a you doin
with the books uh do you read with her do you read to her at home
yes
um but typically i don't like have her like sitting on my lap because she chews the board books and like destroys the board books so
uh we try to give her something else and then read with her
you know because they after like five minutes of it being chewed the whole board book starts to like come apart
so we have a cloth book that we we have cloth books so that that she's allowed to play with because that actually like maintains
right you chew on cloth books
yeah
um
there was one book you tried to read to her
which one was that
uh on the
because she's very into uh farm noises
lo you're like lyin on a piece of toast
silly girl
yeah
is that comfortable
um
she really likes when we make farm animals noises and my husband thought that she just liked the actual noises
like quack
quack no you're not gonna do it
and so he went actually the other day he was out shopping with her and he wanted to get her one of those speak and says you know that makes the noises
but apparently it's not funny to actually the actual noise
it's one of us doing it is what's funny about it
so i thought that uh she would like that but she's not in the mood right now
bock
no you're just way too busy chewing
bock
is that what chicken says
sometimes she like cackles she thinks it's so funny
um any animal noise or any other kind of like sound effect noise that you make she's really into that
but for some reason she thinks it's funny that we do it but like when the actual noise occurs she doesn't think it's as funny
um
why's it funny
you don't know
what um animals um d you make noises for
um
swell lets see what's in the old mcdonald songs like
ah cheep
which would be like a like a little chicken no it's a what's a little chicken called like when they're like little yellow yeah chick there ya go
duh that's pregnancy brain
um and bock that's chicken
and moo would be cow
and oink yeah pig what else
no
what is this
yeah baa we did sheep
baa
ah not as funny somehow
buzz
buzz for a bee
and any other bug my husband thinks they all make buzzing noises we have a disagreement about that
i think they don't all make buzzing noises but
um lets see
can you think of some bock
you don't think it's funny at all
you don't think anything's funny today
um yeah are you just overwhelmed say i'm overwhelmed by these toys
um you were this one
oh the peas
i dunno if she was into the peas or not i thought she might be
because we eat peas but they don't look like that really she usually gets them in the pea pod
and this animal
um
the fox
the fox oh now you want the fox
see that lady touched the fox i think i want that now
and then i know you didn't pick this up but think d you have this at home
no
you mean that particular toy
or the food
tacos in general
yeah
uh yes she has eaten tortillas but i mean
i dunno i don't think that she made the connection that says tacos and mom and dad eat tacos
did you make all that no
and does she have milk or does she not
ah no she doesn't like she stanchly refuses any bottle or anything so
or in her sippy cup
yeah
milk
ah she just drinks water
oh okay
out of a like either a regular water bottle or a sippy cup um
and she like i said she did seem to like recognize that right
like if i give you this wha move your foot no what are you doing
i'm give uh wait
i see you wiggling
she was like this in
if i give you a sippy cup will you
yeah she's actually see like trying to suck it
she says come on where
it's not comin out
is it not comin out
d you want some water
have a cheated you she says you're cheating me
i think she's thirsty
yeah she gets really well
eh she's just a very social bird so if she sees us eating food she wants food
oh
and she will not like let us eat unless she gets to eat
or like if i take a sip out of a bottle of water
she gets very upset if she can't also have water
so can i take this off is that okay
yeah
okay
we um briefly looked at the ice cone and he saw the waffle
the waffle anything else
no
he didn't go there really
any of this stuff or
um i picked it up but he didn't really pay attention when i looked at it
okay
yeah
what other items did he like to play with
he loved the keys
and the spoon
and the foam clock
and we read the book put me
you going to the zoo
and we did the white played with the white seal a little bit
yeah
does he have any does he like play dolls or things like that at home
well with being a brother he doesn't have any dolls at home
um right now he plays with a lot of like um rings that stack
um and he has a couple of uh musical toys like drums and those kinds of things he really plays a lot with
and books a little bit
do you remember what else you showed him maybe
he briefly looked at the doll but he had no interest
none
i showed it to him and he's like oh
he just smacked it in the head with the keys
yeah
you don't like these do you
unless it's a real one huh
yeah
you like ice
say i haven't really tried it yet
probably a good thing
huh
i guess with an older brother there's not many dolls in the house huh
no
okay
well
yeah
i'm sure by next time he'll be more wanna venture more
he didn't even blink did her
hey do you see this over here
what is that
does it look rea
no
no interest huh
no
it's real enough
i know
i don't understand why he's just like no
no dolls
nope
especially not that kind
you gonna tell her about it
you like to talk
yeah
you are cute
my goodness
don't put that in your mouth
it's okay they clean them all after
yeah
but i'm trying to teach him not to put everything in his mouth
otherwise it'd be everything huh
how ya doin
you're a talkative guy
say i gotta make sure i keep my attention span with everybody
since my brother likes to take it away
yeah older siblings do that don't they
are you a younger sibling
no i'm an older
oh me too
i talked for my brother
poor kid didn't talk
yeah
he's bigger than you though
he's twenty one
you love keys don't ya
you think you wanna drive a car
oh that'll be the day
yeah
i think you're a little too small to see over the steering wheel
they make booster seats and long brake pedals
for the short people
keys that's okay
where you going
absolutely
um so what do you think um she liked to play with today
the doll and the keys have been her fascination today
what
yeah
how was she playing with them
how were you engaging her to play
um the doll i'm not sure she was getting
the doll was confusing
she kinda wanted to play with it but seemed frustrated with it
um so just kinda talking to her about what she had
um everything that goes to the mouth
so the keys were great it's teething time so any toy that goes to the mouth is a fabulous toy
yes
oh now you found the mic
i was waiting for that
um trying to show her just a couple different things
um just so so she saw what was around
but she tended to go back to those few
yeah
different one
mostly the doll the key
a little bit of the food
right
um would you think she picked out particular um like colors of keys or do you think it would
no
i think it just she found what it was the blue one and i guess just something grabbed her eye on that one
but i don't think it was color related
no
i don't
we didn't realize there were other ones till the last couple minutes
yeah
right
you said that she played with some of the food items
were there some that you think that she's beginning to recognize the names of or do you think she was attracted to some items that have the colors
i don't think it was recognition of food from home
would it be the colors
or just i would say vicinity but it's not vicinity she can get around
i dunno if it's the shape
to fit in your hand well
what would we say
you know it tended to be the brighter colors so maybe it is c maybe colors
you're making me work here
think about this
i'm sorry
no it's okay it's fine
um do you have pretend food at home
no
and she doesn't have a big doll like that so i was thinking oh i might have to go get a doll for her she's got two brothers at home older brothers so most of the toys are not what most people would say girly toys
um so there is one babydoll in the house but i don't think it's even out where she would be able to find it and play with it
so it made me think i might need to go get her something like that she seemed to gravitate right towards that one
but no
no food
that's not true
we do have fake food but not like kid food
we have fake like um fruit
big size regular fruit food but
they don't know about that
okay
so she probably um doesn't you were saying that she probably doesn't recognize any of those foods from the foods at ho
or the names of it
or even the look i guess
probably not
i mean do we have pizza at home
yes we eat pizza but she's not exposed to it
um a plate maybe
but again you're not using plates
well you're using a bowl but it's not that not that close to you
so i don't i don't think it's recognition yet i don't think it's familiar
probably more like the shape and texture maybe of the jars
like put them together or
no the jars might be more similar just like just of the toys the shape at home
and it fits in her mouth so
yeah is that funny
silly
what do you play with at home
you play with you play with a lot of big kid toys
i know
you play with she plays with a lot of cars
she plays with
she plays with her brothers' cars
um right
it's mostly actually the boys stuff upstairs not yours
so it is yours
um oh i know
i'm sorry i wiped your noise
not nice
not nice thing to do mom
how um did you play with any of the stuffed animals
i tried to play a little bit with the word world ones but she was not into it
she wanted to go back the keys or the doll
so
a couple times i tried to change to the the stuffed animals or the book and she just didn't want those
wasn't interested in those today
i'm sorry you said she has stuffed animals at home
no
i i was just trying to bring in today to change her um the toys she was playing with just to kinda show her other things
so we did i grabbed these and i grabbed this one
and then i grabbed a book and wasn't too in into those too much
now we do the stuffed animals that he will play with smaller things like this
not this one but like a little stuffed animal
have you begun to like introduce their names
do you think that she recognizes what some of the animals would be if you produced them
no
no
no
okay
absolutely not
um one like i said she doesn't really play with them and i just i don't she's gotten the concept
i think she's starting to recognize maybe when we talk about like sitting down to eat
and i think she recognizes when we talk about like the family
a little bit
um but i don't think she's at that at that point yet
and maybe i'm underestimating you but i don't think you do
i don't
i don't
so you you said you guys um looked at some books
do you have some of these books at home
we have put me
we have the foot but we have them in the bigger versions
um she's never seen this one
but we do
we read books
and a lot of times the bo with her brothers and she'll sit there with us
she will grab books sometimes and just kinda play with the pages
so she is familiar with books
yes
so i would say you kinda recognize a book we play with those
right
is she interested in the touch and feel
not at all
really
not at all
that was wa the keys really i mean these were fascinating her
right
you just like those
that's what exactly why
what
and maybe if i had shown her the book when she wasn't fascinated with the other toy
instead of trying to change her fo to or her focus
right
you had no interest in this book
and now you're gonna be interested in eating
not today
how about any none of the books
no she didn't seem to want to read this one either
or listen
do you play pattycake and games like that or interact with her
we'll do
yes
sometimes we do we do some
we will do um itsy bitsy
we will do abc's with sign language
um we do open shut them
right
no no pattycake really
not so much pattycake
but we'll sing the song open shut them and do the hands with it yes
and then we do abc's and we do sign language so you can follow the hands with that
um other hand plays no
we do little rhyming songs and
oh you
we do we'll go let's see which one
ride a horsie into town
just be careful you don't fall do
and that's one we like to do
right
and then and our and our brothers usually get involved too
right
ride a horsie into town
just be careful you don't fall do
so some of that kind of repetitive play
or songs
yeah
do you think she rec thought uh the doll was another baby when interacting with it
like actions and motions like it was
i was i wasn't sure
i thought maybe
and that's why i wasn't sure if that's why she was getting frustrated
because it wasn't really responding to her
so i didn't know if it was something like you know it's kinda of her size and maybe it looked familiar
and like she would smile at it and then she'd kinda go like grunt would sound is frustrating
so i didn't know if she like thought it was something that should be playing with her
versus her playing with it just soley
what is that over there
what is this thing
and so yeah i was trying to figure out what what was going through her head
it was like i want you but then it was like
you're not doing what i want you to do whatever it was that she wanted
right
what is that
what is this
i mean she definitely was doing what she does to us
she pokes at her eyes she pulls at the hair
she grabs hair
so like that grunt
it's it's like she's frustrated
so i dunno if she expects it to respond differently
did you guys play with any of the articles of clothing or um i dunno
we took off a shoe
or i took off the shoe
but she had no interest in that
she seemed to notice a bandaid but
she's really upset with it
yeah
she's like come play with me
come do something
what is it you want it to do
do you want her to sing talk back to you
stand up like you do
let's see i don't i think she's supposed to do something different
is it like a little baby girl
give you kisses
does she give kisses and hugs and
she'll just give her hugs her squeezes
you know she won't
but no kisses
you're not a kissy kiss yet
that's not true
we'll lean her over and she'll just like open her mouth and drool on you
to give you a kiss
and you know her brother's really love that one
so she will
we'll like kinda lean her in for good night kisses
okay
okay
and as we talk i'm gonna nurse her so i hope you don't mind
no not at all
yeah
um do you think texture um
sounds
um color maybe
sound there were no real sounds in today's toys
it does get her attention some at home some of the noises
um wow
what is it that attracts you to these toys
i mean we could talk about like the difference between some of
like the plastic food is harder um than the stuffed animals
right
texture
so anything that you comparison of these toys
i mean the food and i guess the key were
i mean these were kind of hard and soft
kinda squeezy
good for teething
and so maybe things that are just good to chew on
i mean she probably likes that harder stuff when it all goes to the mouth
um they were the right size for her to pick up
so to be able to grasp and hold and play with they were a good size
so
okay
and how you said at home she plays with cars and things like that does she play similar to how she how she plays at home in some ways
um it actually felt different
and i think it's one because there's such a variety right here
and there were no other distractions which is not very typical at home
um so i was actually surprised that she wasn't more mobile
i wa i thought she was gonna kinda go around and check out other s the chairs
or move around to other toys than actually sit fairly fairly still here
so that kinda surprised me
that she was actually engaged in the toys
well not just even i mean that she just wanted stayed in this one vicinity
and i thought she might explore a little bit more or take a toy over somewhere move about them more there's so many
and it was all right in front of her so she didn't have to go far
if there were because there were no other real distractions
which you know like i said usually at home it's her brothers
or we're i guess not sitting with her for fifteen straight minutes at a time
um which sounds bad as i say that but reality is you know it just doesn't happen as much at home
so it was it was interesting to watch her just kinda sit here
and play with just a couple
and stay in a fairly small area
does she play with each toy the same way as she would at
does she explore them the same way or did you find yourself since it was new kind of um prompting her differently or you know
no that i mean the way she played seemed fairly simi familiar or similar that the way we do at home
okay
you know we talk about what she's playing with
and then sometimes we just let her kinda go with you know without the prompts or without the the talking
the narrative to it
right
so
you know we try to kind of you know go over oh it's the pizza or oh you've got blue key
um and then sometimes it's just play quietly or for a few minutes just kinda let her do what she was doing
so it's not forced
right
kind of let her play on her own
okay
was there anything um any of the items here that you think
i know i keep asking you in different ways the same question
it's okay
that you think um she was familiar with or even new kind of some new items that
well stuffed animals i would say is pretty new
i'm what did i say the b
sorry the babydoll
not the stuffed animals
books familiar
um food new
i'm just trying to think of if it would be similar to even though we don't have food but the shape to another toy at home
no i think they're pretty they're pretty novel for what we have
um trying to think of the toys that have been upstairs that she's been playing with a lot
we have a lot of blocks like square soft blocks that she plays with
rattles
um what else do you like to play with
you're at your table top toy more
so that's you know stationary
um a lot of novelty for her
the stuffed animals even at home she doesn't play with too much
i mean they're there
but it's not one of her go to toys
right
okay so like everything could have been potentially well not everything but a lot of it could have been potentially new
unique and kind of
yeah and like new like words like in i like presenting them in isolation
this is a that kind of thing
yes
yes
that funny
yeah we're talking about you
yeah these are yeah
i a lot of it's probably new vocabulary when we talk about it other than colors
colors we'll talk about um
but a lot of it would be new new words
okay
what are you doing
is there anything else that we didn't talk about that you played with today
um i don't think so
no
no
no we tried to play with the books but she didn't
i i mean i thought that the stuffed animals were gonna catch her attention more
just the colors and just
but they caught my attention
i like 
no that's not
what do you think
no
okay
um like i said the doll
made me think i'm gonna have to go get the doll from downstairs and let her play with it a little bit more
okay
oh you're so happy now
yeah
so much better
okay
well i think that that's it for today then
okay
gonna go ahead and ask you a few questions
okay
he can keep on playing
so do you find that if he was going for anything in particular
yes i found that he he was really interested in the cylindrical shapes
like these
and um really brightly colored
like th pizza things he he was interested in this
these are food these are things we don't have at all at home
so it was mostly things that he had never really seen before
he was very interested in exploring
when i tried to show him books though
he was like eh i want to see this right now
so he kinda looked at it for a second two different types of books that i read
which books did you read
um on the farm
and goodnight moon one two three
and um
i we have goodnight moon and it's a very similar illustration
to that book so he looked at it for a minute and then he went back to doing what he wanted to
which is not really uncommon anyway but i thought it was interesting cause he wanted to try all the new things
are there any food items that he you think like were familar to him like things that you did have at home
spoon yep
the spoon um
he has a sippy cup that looks a lot like but only a bigger version that he's just starting to learn how to use and
and um he was really interested in this when he first came
and then he saw like he'd never seen pizz
i mean you know not that it looks like that
um and also he was really interested in the baby doll he has a few stuffed animals but he doesn't have any dolls so i'm not sure if he's every really like played or seen with a baby doll before
and it's almost the same size when i had him had the baby doll sitting up he was like looking right at it eye to eye so
he seemed kinda interested in that
he's really rollie pollie right now
yeah
he likes to r around
he's getting ready to being mobile soon
have does he still just get milk or does he ever get juice or
n juice he gets formula and breast milk and um he started on solids two months ago
does he know any of his like animal sounds yet
he has this little um dogs yes because we have two dogs but he has um he has this little baby einstein like um thing that makes animal noises
i'm not sure if he could actually equate those with
the animal on the farm but um but they make like quack quack
quack quack quack
o he's so cute
thank you
did he go for any of any of the stuffed animals it doesn't look like it
no he has he has um a few stuffed animals and um things like that
he really was not interested in them interestingly i've like tried to get him to play with a few of them and he'd look at it and kinda smile and then go back to all the colorful things
he liked the ice cream cones a lot too
and these little spaghetti type ones
pasta
he seemed to like the round shapes too like he'd go for a lot i guess a lot of these are round shapes
he went for the bread a couple times too
i wonder if he's actually like sorting them by
by shape or color
oh i was it was probably me i was like
he was just picking up stuff and then putting them back down
would he know what some of these things are like peanut butter and
not yet um he'd know peas but they don't look like this cause his peas are still really they're pureed peas
but peas are his favorite food
nope no no
victor no no
yeah oop
we don't need to do that
whoop
did he ever play with the clock at all
he did when he i showed it to him he kinda just looked at it and then when he was when he like kinda fell over and then rolled back onto his stomach to play and then he was interested in it
and what kind of things did he do with the the baby doll like
he just smiled at it
oh
he didn't and kinda reached for it but he didn't really
did you do anything with the clothing or anything like that
um the sock the shoe
he played with the shoe was separate the little pink shoe and then i put the shoe on him and showed him that baby's shoe victor's shoe but i don't know if he really got the correlation yet
the general gist of that
yes
let's see
so did solid foods
does he see plates at all at home
he does yeah he was interested in the plates too
he's feed out of little bowls but um but yeah we have plates at home
so i heard you talking about pears do you do you make them
yes
yeah
yep he eats pears all the time but he doesn't usually see them whole like this though
maybe i'll introduce them to him and he was also very interested in the pear as well
no no
lets see
lets see
has he ever been to the zoo before has he ever seen it
n
the zoo animals
not yet
farm animals
not yet
we have um oop no
not yet unfortunately
we were going to go to the petting zoo and then we got rained out so
you gotta see the cows
we've seen he's seen them like
driving by but not like up close
do you live in a rural area
um
my parents do
oh okay
and horses he's seen horses before
so what kinda things
what kinda does she do they have on the farm
in the farm area
yeah
um they have cows and horses
cows and horses okay
and then he sees all different types of dogs which really interest him cause like especially when they bark
i like gods t
you like the doggie
does that taste good
okay well i think that's pretty much it
okay
that's all we got
okay
so what did she seem most interested in
um
i'd say the spoons
she really liked the spoons
basically anything that's really easy to pick up and put in her mouth right now
is tops
is she teething
oh yeah
oh yeah she's got two teeth in on the bottom
and she's got one i think somewhere on the side that she's workin on
it's been tough
but we're gettin there hopefully they'll come in soon
so what things did you show her
um mary what did i show you little girl
i showed you the bread
um pizza spoons
plates
i didn't show her the chicken
um
the bumblebee and the deer
ice cones
does she like playing with animals at home
we don't play with animals a lot at home actually we don't really have animal stuffed animals yet
so
like she has a stuffed doll
that's about like that same size
but
yeah we don't have animals and we don't have food stuff to play with at home
we have lots of spoons though don't we
that was new
the peas
so is there anything you thought she'd be interested in but she wasn't
um
i thought she would be more interested in the stuffed animals in general
or the books we do read a lot of books at home
but it might just be where she was sitting
that she just wanted all the food stuff
that was right around her and easy to grab
so which foods did she play with
uh mar well the peas which is funny she hates peas
me too mary
you're a goofy girl
um the pizza mostly
and the peas caught her
and the sandwich meat and the bread
tear at the end
get that cheese
are any of these foods that you eat a lot at home that she might recognize but not
um
yeah the peas was weird but she never really sees them in the whole pea state
she sees the mushed up state
um
we do eat pizza kind of often
but it's never cut like this we do ours like in a we make it at home
and we cut it in squares
like ledo's
right just like ledo's that's good stuff
um
and we make sandwiches but
so did you read any books to her
started looking at good night
we read the good night every night before bed so that caught my eye
um
but she seemed a lot more interested in the toys around her than the books at the moment
do you recognize that
the quiet old lady
what does she whisper
hush
there's not much plot development in
no not much
fork
one two three four
so this is how she usually plays at home or
usually i'll put like a few toys around her and she'll just go with them
whatever is close grabs 
puts down grabs another one
i'll usually sit her up to play
she can get
i don't know if she can like if she wants to get down onto her stomach or if she happens to fall down on her stomach a lot
but
she'll eventually fall onto her stomach
and then we'll play on her tummy for awhile
but yeah it's mostly just looking at stuff putting it in our mouth
that sort of thing
it's an exciting existence at six seven months
yeah
you need to start walking
it's such a big spoon
yeah
did you show her any other animals
not really i talked about a couple of them but i didn't really show them to her
which ones did you talk about
i talked about like the word world sheep
the sheep over there basically
yeah those are cool
yeah that's pretty sweet i saw that show once like a few weeks ago
i was like it's a kinda weird show
kinda psychedelic but
i was like oh cool
i might get myself some of those
yeah
so does she she has a does she have a babydoll or anything like that
she does she has one
it's about the size of this bee
but it's like pink and just my first babydoll stuff
and it has a rattle inside it
that she likes to shake
and she has a little raggedy ann doll also
that's cool
it's almost as big as you
i know it's huge
oh my goodness
yeah she doesn't have any that look like that
none of those yet
alright mary
get the bee
so we are done
all finished
sorry i didn't mean to make you cry
been gasy lately anyway and that's upsetting to so
yeah
i just have some questions
sure
what did you want to play with first
um what did we play with first oh the chihuahua
okay
what did you call the chihuahua
i called it the dog and i think i called it a puppy
what did you play with afterwards
uh i think we played with the frog next
we played with the frog and then we the waffle
does she at home
no no she doesn't
what other stuffed animals did you play with
um what did we we played with the bee and we played with the kangaroo
do you have these stuffed animals at home
oh yes
yes she does
don't you
you got a caterpillar
giraffe
and you have a little stuffed babydoll too don't you
oh and a lion don't forget the lion
aw
you didn't get babydoll today
no well her babydoll is small and stuffed so
and she just eats her hair mostly
alrighty well were all done
okay
give you back the mic
no
okay so i just have a few questions for you
okay
um
so i can't remember what was he interested most in last time
which toys do you remember
not the books i know that
uh i think again more of like the plastic sort of
manipulative toys
he didn't have one object in particular or
i don't i don't think he had one think in particular
he was that interested in last time
okay
and then today
if you had to pick like three objects that
spaghetti
and the pizza
an kind of a toss up maybe this thing probably because i pushed it on him
okay
but definitely the spaghetti and the pizza i would say were his favorites
okay
and does he have any of these toys at home
yeah he does have um we have a toy piz a small plastic pizza at home
and he loves well he just likes to go in the kitchen in general and just pull out all the i think it's just cause it's so colorful and small and tactile
and does he have any of these toys other than that at home
he's got a winnie at home or we have a winnie at our house
some plates
what did you find what did you find
here
come on let's come this way wes let's play with the toys okay
and of course we have a lot of books at home and
stuffed animals
uh let's see we have a karen katz book
this one we have these books but not this exact one
we have doctor seuss but not this exact one
so no none of these exact books
do you think he knows the names of any of any of the items
um
this way wes
you know he seems to be starting to recognize more words understan like all of a sudden really like in the last few weeks i've even noticed
sometime i think he knows cow
um and pig i kind of think he knows pig
and i don't know you would think maybe by now he would know pizza but
i don't know
wes where is the pizza can you get the pizza
yeah see with him like sometimes i feel like he just gets so into his one thing it's hard for me to really know i think if i really if he was focused and i really said where's the pizza i think he would probably get the pizza
he plays with that pizza a lot but
i'm not really sure
does his sister play with him a lot when it comes to like i dunno dolls or
i dunno maybe like thirty percent of the time
they kind of like coexist they do play together and like she certainly is physical with him like comes up and puts like hats on him and
puts stuff on him and
wants to make him part of his imaginative play and
um do you think he prefers books or toys
toys
yeah um
um he just doesn't like to sit still to look at books that much
unfortunately i mean i try but he
you know like my daughter i always say like from four months on she would just sit in my lap and look at books
like this age she had phenomenal receptive language
she knew like all the animals and what not but
he just he's a different kid he's much more interested in exploring like he is
you know when he is in the house he's always into the drawers and opening everything and taking everything out and touching everything and
that just seems to be his method of learning about things is being a more into everything
this is fun i like this fun little hair
i guess it could be in theory sort of a choking hazard though
i guess so if you stretch him out
i think that's all we have for today
um then we will see you again for the third visit
probably next month i don't know if you scheduled it yet
no i haven't
okay so we will be giving you a call
okay
okay
wes no no
wes no no
yeah no no
ouch
it's
alright
eh uh she's probably done
next question so if i could just interview you really quick
yeah
then you guys
okay
then
sure
okay
okay
and he can just
you wanna keep playing hehe
you can
you you can keep playing
you can just
okay
you keep playing
um
well i don't know if you remember
exactly
what he liked the first time
but did you notice
or remember any changes from what he played with
um i remember that last time he played with the stuff that was similar to what we had at our house
you want me to read it
in a minute little guy
okay
um
and i kind of the same
this time
um
the waffles like we have waffles at home
that are pretty much the same
um and we have other food to but the ones that are the same as what we have are the pizza and the waffles
the other ones are just a little bit different
and he kinda picked
and those are the ones he picked out
um
the clock i don't
we don't have a clock
so i was surprised that he picked that up but
i dunno if it was the texture maybe
the foam
cause we have some foam things at home and he likes those too
yeah
and the baby i dunno
maybe cause of leah
haha
uh he likes the baby
and uh we don't have a lot of
babies
at home at all
so
i dunno
um
um and we do read all the time
yeah
so
so you would say i was going to
he's um very comfortable with the books and he tries to turn the pages all the time at home
he seems really familiar with
yeah
are there any of these you have at home or
we have a peekaboo book its not exactly the same but its really similar
where it says something
a question
and then you open it and there's a baby that says
peekaboo
um
so that one's really similar
the other ones are not
he doesn't have the zoo one
no
no
okay
um
let's see
which toys do you think interested him most er would you answer the same way the ones that are familiar
yeah it seems like the ones that are f
i think just the ones that are most familiar
besides the clock i dunno that one seemed a little more random
okay
um and it looked like
does he play with baby dolls at home
not really
he seems
doing some feeding are you guys were or something
yeah uh
to eat
we don't really um she did um my daughter does that with her stuffed animals
oh
so and maybe and he's just now getting into food
so it may just be from that
nothing's going to come outta there
that's just pretend
do you play any sorta of um
just pretend
little games hide and seek and that kind of stuff
we do peekaboo a lot
and um
his sister does peekaboo with him all the time too
so
his sister
yeah
when she's not crying heehee
ha yeah yeah
she likes to play with them
that one's not real
i'll feed you in the car
i'll feed you in the car
you answered that already answered that already
do you think he prefers books or toys
books or toys or does it depend on
it kinda depends on his mood i've um
the only time i could get him to really sit for a book uh um
really calmly is when he's
tired or right before a nap or before bedtime the rest of the time he just wants ta
flip through
randomly or eat it
but sometimes hehe yeah
yeah
or puttin it in his mouth
or eating it
and he didn't seem to to um i dunno if that was
it might've been cause i was blocking i dunno uh
um
stuffed animal talking
not really
we have a bunch
uh she's obsessed with them but he doesn't really get into them no also she tells him no he can't so maybe that's why haha
he's a good listener
um
ha
okay and you said he doesn't necessarily pretend to do any feeding at home with
no no
yeah
um
okay
um and about any changes you said it's pretty much the same that
similar yeah
things that he has
yeah yeah seemed that way
um
okay oh and i noticed does does he know body parts or do you do body parts
he doesn't seem to
um we do them a lot but i haven't noticed him consistently
so he wasn't necessarily
knowing them or pointing to them no i don't think so
yeah
okay
and
uh
what's yummy
are you sharing
that's your new thing
you hold it out and go yeah
that's a ducky
it's a ducky
and a sheep
uh there's leah
can you see that she's looking
alright
um
alright
i hope i didn't forget to ask you anything
is there anything
that um stands out to you about the way he interacts with toys or what he his preferences are anything like
not really
no
okay
nope
alright
alright the next time we see you we'll just
next time we'll live leah with daddy heehee
i was surprised she's
i dunno she was
she was tired
she was tired she was sick last weekend and n now she has a tooth so its just a lot of things
its hard for her
its ya know he's been getting all the attention
yeah and he's getting attention from me which she doesn't love
come back and turn this way
hi honey do you wanna come to see the toys okay
you're welcome
sure
um i just have a few quick
sure
questions for you
uh which of the toys seem to interest him the most
and which is a good toy for his personality do you think
um that's an interesting question
like why do you think certain things interest him
i think um the baby was certainly interesting to him of the face
and he loves to see babies faces in books
and in magazines
and in um like real babies that's definitely interesting and it's kind of like you know a real baby
um and definitely a sippy and the bottle um
he's a big eater and big drinker
so um we don't actually have we have books
but we don't really have a lot of we don't we don't have any play
um
i mean we have some stuffed animals
but um i don't know just needs to chew on and so
and which of the toys seem to interest him the least and why do you think so
i think he was not interested in the book not because he doesn't like books more but because there was better interest and more interesting things to play with
so um i think there was more of a uh like a time just a particular time allotted and a lack of interest
and um do you think there are any items he recognizes the name of
and were there any items that you think he's never seen or heard before name of them
he's never heard the word fawn i'm sure
um uh deer maybe for that matter
but um certainly sippy
and bottle
and plate
and keys
and cookies
um measuring spoons
book
ice i'm not sure about ice cones
yeah no he's he's he's tasted ice
um
books
baby
keys
um spaghetti
uh okay quite a few
um and do well you already answered this one do you ever play with pretend food not really
um do you ever play with pretend dolls at home
he has uh yeah there's a doll at home
that um that he's played with um well that we've seen
he's had interaction with
and certainly he has a little cousin so he's had there's babies he sees babies
um okay and um was there a particular book if any of them that you think he particularly was interested in
um
like with the way that you are feeling
definitely he would he would definitely like this book
um well we we have a very similar peekaboo a baby turn cast book it's not this one but and um
so books with babies books with things to touch in
things to lift up he likes those kinds of things
um i haven't really done too much doctor seuss with him
we have good at home so no not this one
um that's all i have for you yup
um and she did she give you a toy
yeah
and everything yeah okay great
just a few questions for you
okay
so during this session which toys um do you think alexander was most interested in
um
it's hard to say i switched it up on him a lot
yeah
i kept showing him new things
but he like the uh measuring spoons a lot
cause has the keys
and then i think he likes when he gets something if you try to take it
he liked it so
um he was first drawn to the stuffed animals i think
but that might have been he was facing them
but then he liked he didn't like the books that much
hey
and why do you think he liked okay well you said he probably liked the stuffed toy animals because they were in front of him
why do you think he likes the play food
um i think we don't have any play food at home so maybe that was it
plus if he bangs it can make a sound
he likes to do stuff like that
um and it feels feels different and everything
um if anything he probably liked the stuffed animals because they have a face and he loves just interacting
that's his biggest his biggest thing
do you think there have been any items that um his interests maybe have changed since the last time that like before he was here from the last time he was here
the last time
do you think any of his interests have changed
um he was definitely more interested uh in the items themselves than he was last time
like i probably could have just sat here and watched him and he would have played the whole time
i wouldn't have ev even had to do anything with him
versus in the past
it was a lit so i think he liked the food items more than he did last time
okay
what have you got
so which book um wo do you think that alexander would prefer to read or look at with you
um probably the pat the the touch and feel book
he likes stuff like that he likes things with animals
um of the books that were there the only one we have is good night moon
we don't ha uh we might have one of the other ones
but the ones that he usually reads aren't aren't in that pile
um but he likes to touch and eat stuff so
i would say the texture book was his he would like better
um does alexander play with any similar toys at home
um he has some stuffed animals
he doesn't have any food items
um so not that many similar
a lot of them are very different actually
he has a toy box in our basement
and he goes in just like he did here and he pulls himself up and he pulls stuff out
but it's there's like to tools and there's a lot of puzzles
the puzzles where you pull it away and the same piece is there
okay
the picture's underneath it but he likes that a lot
um uh he likes he likes things that have music
so we have a lot of things like that
so most of the things here we do not have at home
do you think alexander prefers books or toys
toys
does alexander play with any dolls at home
um there's some teddy bears that he'll play with sometimes
but not much
he has them there but he doesn't really play with them
okay
do you think that he recognized any of the foods
from the last time he was here
or even maybe he can recognize any of them from home
um not from home
uh from last time
we played with the peas a lot last time he was playing wi
i dunno
i can't tell if he recognized or not
and at this point do you think that alexander recognizes the names of any of these items
or is he beginning to recognize the name of some of these toys
he's beginning to recognize the names of um some animals
and i think baby sometimes he recognizes
uh the foods no
i don't use those terms a lot
what animals has he started to recognize
um lion
we have a lion at home that he plays with a lot
and uh dog
he seems to slowly be starting to recognize
okay
and are there any other items that aren't here um maybe that they're at home or somewhere else that you think that maybe alexander's recognized the names of
um lets think
i think diaper
he recognizes the name of
um not a whole lot yet though
not a whole lot yet
and i don't know if that's because i don't use the words a lot
or he's just not ready for it
definitely he recognizes the name of mom and dad
things like that
but as far as toys go not not as much
that's it
sure
just a couple things that she played with i could ask you
it looked like she did a lot of playing with the kitchen stuff like the food and stuff
she's still she's still real oral
she still puts everything in her mouth
and pretty much p like plastic toys is is what she goes for
does she have anything like that at home or does your other daughter
so this is a little bit familiar
yeah
definitely the plates the utensils and the pretend food
okay so does she have any of these actual food items like pizza
not specifically
no i think we mi we have a spaghetti that looks just like that
but that's about it
no cookies
no cookies no waffles
no no
sandwich
no no sandwich at home
no she's not really familiar with sandwich
we do have the peas
and how about a bottle
we do have some bottles
but they don't look anything like that
haha no
and she doesn't even take a bottle
haha but she sees them a lot
yeah she knows what they're for huh
because we babysit another baby
and that baby takes bottles
right
so do you think that
knows cookies
would be playing with this if if libby wasn't playing with that stuff
she likes this on her own sort of thing
yeah
i would think so
and is it because of her personality or just the stage she's at do you think
i sort of think it's like her her stage
i think i think she still really likes to put stuff in her mouth still
and that's the the most
she also has three teeth currently coming in on the top
so i think
you think the fact that it's hard
i think it's it's it's both exploratory and it feels good
thank you
you have a bottle for me
thank you
um books are actually ha still hard for her because um she doesn't she doesn't care to sit still for too long
like i ha if if i'm gonna read to her it has to be before she goes to sleep
and she's kind of um you know slowed down enough
um and then like s even stuffed animals she's not so big with
my other daughter was real like nurturing even by this age
like she would hold it
and she does that very rarely
she didn't really even go for that stuff did she
right
did she like the the winnie the
i think she was kind of neutral
okay so those maybe least
and the books not really because she's so active
yeah and she's really famil
i i'm alway i tr try to kind of shove books down their throat a lot i think
so she doesn't really care
she's rather do what she wants to do
do you so would you say that she prefers toys over books then
yes definitely
and um besides these things that you said you have at home do you have any um any of these actual same books at home or stuffed animals or baby dolls
we have like similar books to this with the with the um sensory things in 
but not none of these titles no
and um it looked like you were doing some animal things is she interested in that animals and their sounds
um yeah she like she's really um responsive to music and singing
she she um will like kind of dance every time music starts
or if you're singing and she'll s she'll try to sing
right you love singing
haha yeah
do you think she knows any of the animals or their sounds
um no i don i don i don't think she knows to like match them
i know she recognizes them as something familiar
ah i don't know if she would identify yet no
and you but you say animal sounds as well like when you
play a lot yeah
um let's see do you think her interests have changed since the last time she was here a couple months ago
um i think she's definitely more interactive
with with playing
oh she's got a rip
i think she's definitely more interactive with with me when she plays
last time she was here i know um i felt funny because i felt like i haven't been playing with her that much
but she was like so um into like exploring on her own
and i remember when she was a couple months younger like she she could just hang out and play for an hour on her own
just picking stuff up putting it down whatever
and now she definitely wa
i mean she'll still do that clearly
but um she likes to play with my husband and i a lot too
yeah it seemed like she was doing that she was really interested
you played some little games with her like put the cookie in and take it out
which hand has the cookie and
she seemed to like that
she definitely she definitely looks for um interaction now
if her sister is not around she'll play by herself
but as the minute her sister's in she goes to where she is
you know and it's a problem
haha but she always wants to be where she is
playing with her toys and and bugging her
i'm just curious does she sort of try to interact with libby or does she just wanna have
she kind of just wants to have whatever she has yeah
and i think she
i don't know if she knows but
she probably notices there's different toys out
like libby is allowed to play with different toys than she is
she's not allowed to have the crayons
she's not allowed to have the small pieces
so um so a lot of times when those things are are novel she goes for 
and she is definitely when i was here last time she was not resistant
like if i took a toy away she wouldn't really care
now she'll scream at me if i take something away that she's really into
interesting so she's changed a lot
let's see um does she play with dolls at all
a very little bit and just starting
like the other she got a a a baby doll for christmas
that um she seems to know is hers
and she's carried that around a bit
and she has a stroller that she pushes
but her absolute fa her absolute favorite at home is this little ride car that we have in that we have
and she puts herself in it all day long
and kind of yells waiting to be pushed
so that's new
you know she knows she needs somebody to push her
she's communicating that
yeah
wow
caroline
you're just amazing
let's see so that's different from last time
was she eight months when we were here last time
or six
she was um we try to get get children between six and a half and seven and a half
for the first visit
seven months a little before a little after
peekaboo
she probably wasn't standing up then
well i i know it was hard for her she was in a bumbo
and i know that was weird for for her
because she was definitely crawling by then
peekaboo do you wanna play peekaboo
you can play with that peekaboo
does she like that game
yes she play she'll play on her on her own like um whip her head around
yeah
peekaboo
oh what if just knowing her personality what sort of toys do you think sort of are her
musical ones
yeah um shh i think she i think she understands cause and effect
like i think if there's when there's t we have this big t this big cube toy that when you hit it it sings a song
and she definitely knows to hit it to get the music
and then she'll dance to it
so yeah that's definitely those are definitely her her faves
so interesting
is that peekaboo
well i think that's all i need to ask at this point
okay
so
which of the toys seem to be of interest to her than most
the keys
and the cookies
and the bee
um
and i guess the bear little bit
have you noticed any changes since the last which i remember included last night
um
i mean i think it was similar in the sense that like i mean she's not doing a lot of interactive play like imaginative play yet
she's still kind of mostly just exploring everything
um so it seems about the same i mean maybe a little bit more interested
um like like the functions of things like i mean she was able to engage to a limited amount you know a little bit more in the imaginative play but
let's see
which of the toys did the most
um the books she definitely she was not as interested in
and
i guess just some of the i mean some of the the stuffed animals she didn't they weren't as interesting to her they didn't like do things like tickle her or whatever
yeah what do you see he's saying hi to all the animals
let's see which books do you think she would prefer to read or look at like any types of books
um she usually likes the ones that are interactive where she can feel things
um i mean i was surprised that she didn't want to lift the flaps the peekababy because she's really into peekaboo these days
but i think she was pretty preoccupied with the uh
yeah
huh
okay do you play with any similar toys at home now
i mean we have a baby doll that we've since the last time we came we've taken it out and we've played with it
now um but she's still mostly just like would give it kisses and like like look at it's eyes and stuff like that
um books we have a lot of um and i don't
i mean we have some stuffed animals but again like we don't play with them too much
okay do you think she prefers books or toys in general
um i guess toys
and you said you do play with dolls at home now or you have
yeah
and what does she like to do with them
do you ever pretend to feed them or anything
um not really again we don't have pretend food yet
um and like the doll doesn't usually come to the table with us when we're eating
so no i mean we don't really pretend to feed the baby much but we
you know mostly she'll give it kisses and like we'll talk or whatever
at this point do you think she recognizes any of the items or
um
well for sure baby book
um bee maybe
i mean there's enough toys that she has that like have bees on them like winnie the pooh bee stuff like that
um so she may recognize that
um puppy she should recognize
but i think she probably recognizes again we have a lot of like toys so yeah
um and like i said some of the words and the like maybe like the ball and there stuff like that
she knows the word ball but whether she understands it in a two d um thing i don't know
okay
that's it all set
are you having fun
yeah you are huh
okay so some of these questions are um the same as the ones before
we just wanna so get an idea if anything has changed as far as what he's what he likes or seems interested in
okay
um okay so we which of these toys did he seem the most interested in
the plas hard plastic ones
okay
food items
okay
um any of them in particular
um i think he liked the cookie
okay
there's two
cookies
okay
find the cookies
where you going
um if you had to pick a toy that you would say is good for his personality what would you say
um
and why
from here
um i would probably say like the waffles or the anything hard and plastic
he likes to pick things up and throw them and bang them around
cookie
um okay
cookie
which of the toys seemed to interest him the least
um the baby dolls and that kind of thing
cords cords cords cords cords
cords
yeah there should be an item for which toys interested in the most
cords that aren't toys
no play with toys
he didn't seem interested in any of the books
he didn't seem interested in the books or
okay
or the baby doll
it's okay
it's okay
no cords
let's see what else we have
do you think he recognizes the names of any of these
probably not
i say some of them because
well he doesn't eat a lot of cookies
but he eats pizza and stuff
but he probably wouldn't recognize the names
um is there any that
i guess he had seen them last time so he
i remember this one but i don't think he does
okay
but he liked the texture last time
and he seems to still like it
and do you have any of them at home
any similar
n i mean we have a couple stuffed things at home
but he doesn't really play with them anymore
okay
we don't really have anything else similar
i mean we have books but
what kind of books do you have
um board books and then like books that we read to him that have textures
i i don't even think we looked in this bin
but yeah we have something like this
which we didn't even see
we didn't even see the book
do you play with pretend food at home
nope
or dolls
nope
nothing like that
okay
i think that is all we have
oh it's interesting now is it
yeah his thing right now
he's into things that aren't toys
paper and cords and
anything breakable or
yeah
anything that can go in small pieces in his mouth
okay
let's put the toys away
put the toys away
zebra
cookie
okay
aw
aw
isabelle
is she ready about that time
yeah she'll she has a li bit of an attention span but
say hello
so um with regards to the last time you were here did you notice any difference with what she wanted to play with the toys
oh yeah
last time she didn't i don't think she knew what was what
um at all
i mean was just i think i remember last time just showing her things and
her just kind of looking at them
um
but i mean i think she was in the bumbo seat last time so she couldn't move anywhere
now she kind of you know she wants to touch everything
so definitely a a big difference
she can you know somewhat participate in like the books or playing or
you know show some reaction
what were some of the toys um
like that
i'm sure any of the food i gave her she put in her mouth last time
um
maybe holding onto a stuffed animal
but
i don't think she really did anything with the books last time
and neither time she didn't she didn't seem interested in the babydoll
the babydoll just hasn't
yeah no it means i guess nothing to her
um what do you think was her favorite thing this time
uh probably putting the food in her mouth
the play food
do you think she recognized the names of any of the food items
u doubtful
i don't i don't think so
no
which food items did you play with today
the pizza slices
she played with this
the waffles i think she was banging together
i think she might've been interested in the liquid
in h in this one
and in this one
um
she might've touched this
um
i think that was it
i don't think we
played with any other food items
and so you don't have food items at home like pretend
yeah we do we do have similar of these i th actually i remember her play with
i do we have these exact ones at home
this and we have the waffles
and s the bottle
at home
so she might might've recognized those
does she eat any of these foods
i mean
yeah but everything i give her it's like cut up really small so it doesn't resemble
you know any of these
you know the way they are
the way these are now
right
but yeah i mean she pretty much eats everything
as long as i just like cut it up in tiny pieces for her
okay
um and then so you also played with animals today
yes
um
uh were there any other specific ones that she may have known the names of or
um just the dog
i don't think she'd recognize any other names but
she kind've when we say dog and woof woof like she'll look around and look for our dog
so um
but that that might've been it i don't think she would recognize any of these other ones
the none of the zoo animals
yeah
haven't e well we haven't really gone over
those maybe the duck
like we you know kind of gone over farm animals with her
but none of these other ones yet
okay
and which ones do you which one do you think is her what do you think was her favorite book today
this one definitely this one
with the touching
yeah
um shh she's usually not interested in books
at all
but if she has they're like more interactive ones
and this one has something she could touch
and do you have any of these books at home
we have the foot book
and we have good night moon not this exact good night moon
but um
i don't know how often she's heard them
probably not
enough for her to like remember it
you know maybe i don't a handful of times she's into foot book
so what happens is we have a three year old
so isabelle
oh watch that
isabelle gets stuck um whatever sophi with whatever we're doing with sophia
she kind of
that's what her activity is
oh okay
so
that's nice
yeah
um how about this activity playing like
the peek a oh yeah she knows peek a
isabelle let me
what are you doing sorry
me
back here sweetie
there ya go
um she really loves peek a
so having so even when we just say peek a
hold on
i know
look there's so many things here for you to play with
um
even us just saying peek a she gets a big smile on her face so
i don't know if she quite understood that you know that the flaps up were peek a but
she liked hearing it
kept her entertained
if you had to name one item that was a lot different from last time that she played with this time what would that be
probably
this
oh and she seemed really interested in this
but she didn't have much
i don't think she had much interest in last time
um
and like just any of the i guess really any of the stuffed animals like just
putting them up to her and she'd hug them
she'd smile
but last time she didn't really do that
you think it was more the the names or the sound effects
the pra my sound effects
yeah i think so
okay
but i don't think she'd like would ha really understand the recognized frog versus bee
um do you have babydolls at home
we do
yes
but she
i don't know i've never seen her play with a babydoll
so they're her sister's babydolls
oh okay
so but um i've never seen her play with 
she's not into yet
no
not yet
okay
alright um and is there i think we probably asked this last time um but so is there a toy that seems to match her personality the most
out of these or just in general
out of these
fits here personality
um
i mean
the stuffed animals i mean she's a really cuddly baby
so i think she likes
so i think being able to hug the stuffed animals
that's um
isabelle
that kind of fits her
her personality
okay
okay i think that is it oh wait
so do you think she prefers the toys over the books
yes
she doesn't at home i we probably don't
read to her as much as we should we might get like one of these books in a day to her
which is like
yeah she likes that
which is like maybe you know these books take like ten fifteen seconds to read you know
so
you know i she's i feel like she's just not as exposed
right
to books
but this stuff is like laying around our house
um we have a play kitchen and so she's always like picking it up and putting it in her mouth
oh okay
oh you do have a play kitchen
yeah we do have play kitchen
yeah we have the the play food not j all of these things just a few of these items
or similar to ones we have at home
okay
but
i don't know if she recognizes them
that's nice
what is that just out of curiosity one of her favorite foods
to eat
yeah
oh boy uh
this girl will eat anything
actually she's um
i guess her favorites just we
feed it to her a lot um
like baby like the corn casserole that comes in the baby jars
the oatmeal cereal that's for babies
she liked that
uh
she likes cheese
likes crackers
um
actually i haven't found anything that she does not like
nice
and so we i mean we're pretty much feeding her the scope of you know
pretty much everything we ever have
isabelle you can't play with that
so maybe the next visit she'll she'll recognized the food
yeah
maybe
maybe yeah we should probably start showing her the foods
that we're like feeding her maybe she'll pick up pick up on it
oh isabelle aw
well we we really appreciate you working with us
oh yeah absolutely
if you could just do me a favor
sure
i b today is june fifteenth two thousand nine and her date of birth is seven eighteen o eight
i appreciate it
yeah no problem
okay do you mind if i ask you a few questions
great
um did you notice any differences as far as what he liked to preferred to play with more this time than last time
ah no he stuck the plastic food in his mouth last time too
um it yeah same general stuff because we have more plastic food at home
he doesn't really care about stuffed animals
and he still loves playing with wires
okay haha
he was beelining for the wires last time too
yeah
do you think he recognized any of the names of the food
um i don't know
we've he doesn't eat any of this food
i mean he's had mushed up peas before
but i don't know if he'd specifically recognize the name of pizza or cookie or peas
ah just because it's not food that he eats
okay
what about baby dolls
do you have baby dolls at home
yeah we have his sister has a baby doll that he chews on her face sometimes
is that what do ya do you with him and
how does he usually play with the baby doll
um like i said they're his sister's
so well there's two of them
and they both belong to his sister
she actually does the interactive you know i'm a mommy
i'm taking care of my baby play
he'll go over and kind of study the features
like why is this little person not moving
and then like i said he just likes to try and chew on her face
it's it's another toy
and he tastes tests everything
anything can get in his mouth he puts there
do you think he recognizes like hand shoe eye
those types of things
some stuff yeah
like i think eyes nose
i don't know if he knows shoe
um he might
um but i don't know how many of the body parts he really recognizes
for me to say
this is the ear
this is the hand
this is the eye
are you reading books at home
yup ah we read picture books together
and you know like the little board books
and then um i'm still nursing him
so i generally have one of my older children's books
that i like alice in wonderland
or um i forget which one of the narnia ones is the one we just finished
i think we're on harry potter now
ah that i just read as you know as i'm nursing him
so not that he's comprehending that
but he's at least hearing it
but then we do yeah we do picture books and stuff
what do you think he likes to play with more at home books or toys
ah toys
he's much more into toys
hey good boy
um do you have any similar of the s su of same books at home
ah we have good night moon
ah we have mister brown can moo
um for some reason mister brown can moo is not a favorite at our house
but good night moon generally is
but we've got a lot of the other classic ones
but he's just you know he'll chew on the covers
but um i have a two and a half year old who's way more interested in books and reading and stuff than he seems to be at the same ages
but we all still read together
yeah
um what about the um books like the touchy feely books
ah he's got a truck book that has different textures in it
and he likes going through
and he'll use the tip of his finger
and he'll he'll you know touch each of the ah textured sections on the pages
he does like the truck book
do you think he likes at this stage more touching or like noises or
ah touching and um things that he can hold easily in his hand
he likes banging toys together
um we have a lot of little people
and so he likes playing with those
they fit well in his hands
and they've got detail
and he'll look at them and then chew on them and look at them again
and um how the farm animals
or the farm animals
the stuffed animals
he's never really cared much for stuffed animals
i think the reason that he played with this one is because it has the um the funny hair
um the sticky hair which gave it a different texture
but he doesn't really care about stuff animals
so yeah he's he's definitely into toys more than books or stuffed animals
okay do you think there were any names like even of like domestic pets or animals maybe that you've seen books on
the names of them that he would be more familiar with
probably more familiar with like you know the regular domestic animals
those
you know like i don't think he knows otter and fox and eagle and fawn which are some of the and goose
um but you know he's i guess he's starting to comprehend the
um we have a little farm set at home
so cow and horse and
those he seems he chews on the lamb a lot
so i'm like
that's the sheep
that's the sheep
but i don't if i said
that's the you know pick out the sheep
if he would be able to
yeah
go and select that one
but we go through we generally do more teaching and explaining and talking about the toys than we do with books
just because that's where his interest is
is more with the toys
so if you were to say what he was least interested in today
stuffed animals
and is that different from the last visit
no he didn't care about the stuffed animals last time either
and he had only medium interest in the books
but liked chewing on the fake food
we have a l a kitchen set and a lot of fake food
so this is most similar to the stuff that he plays with at home
um thank you
does that rattle
and he was tr like i said he was trying to get the wires last time too
but wires aren't one of your categories
yeah haha
yeah
yeah no you still can't play with them i'm sorry
um are the do you think he played similarly here today like he would at home with you
um yeah there's generally the toys aren't necessarily in concentrated piles
so we spend more time kind of going around going from one thing to another
i also have a two and half year old
so a lot of the play that we do is focused around what she says she wants to play w
you know we'll be playing with blocks
and he'll come
and he'll help by knocking over towers and sticking things in his mouth
or we're playing in the kitchen
and he sits over by us and puts things in his mouth
common theme with him
ah but yeah i mean obviously it's a little more awkward to just be in a concentrated environment than when we're at home
but there's a lot more sibling interaction craziness going on
um at home
but yeah i mean just interacting and talking about stuff
and i try and let him just explore a lot on his own
and just you know it's fun to watch them sit and play with something and try and figure it out
and you can just see the gears turning and
see if you can help out at some points with it
and other times they don't really need you
they just you know they're just having fun
that's right
do you think something with the toys has to do with
i asked you some type of variation on this but
um the ah colors or more the sounds
um
my inexpert opinion
um they bang together neat
they make a sound when they bang together
um there's probably different flavors in the plastics
different textures in the plastics and woods and stuff
more opportunity for noise
whereas stuffed animals i guess they all kind of taste the same
um he's also he's he's teething
so i think it's also
it feels good when he chews on hard plastic
like it feels good on his gums to be able to gnaw on things
okay
okay i can't quite remember what she liked during the first visit
but um what do you think she liked most during this one
um shh she definitely liked seemed to like the pretend food
haha she definitely seemed to enjoy that
and um i think she really liked she likes this box of corn
haha she has
not quite sure what she sees in that
i was going to ask you what do you think she likes about that
i don't know
what do you like about that
i don't know what's so appealing about that
yeah
yeah haha
yeah
you know what
i wonder she gets very excited when she sees the yellow box of cheerios
i wonder if that reminds her of the cheerio box
oh very interesting
that's funny
it could have the effect huh
yeah maybe
maybe it kinda
it's yeah
it's the same yellow a yellow cereal box
when she came here
maybe she's thinking about cheerios
she really likes that
and ah she like she seemed to like the spaghetti too just holding it and feeling the texture
bumpy yeah
and she what else did she play with
she played with these a little bit
she kinda shook them
do you shake these
shaky shakys
do you like those
i think so
yeah
yeah they move and make noise
do you ever give her real keys to play with
um i don't i haven't given her like my real keys
um we've got a few different sets of plastic ones at home
but she's seen something like that before
yeah
how this kind of stuff
do you have this at home
um we do yeah
we have some
you have older kids
yeah
we have a play kitchen
um and it's got some pretend food in it
mostly we have like more dishes and pots and pans and stuff
my girls like to cook invisible food
they just yeah
yeah haha
so does she ever play
but we do have we do have some of these cookies and stuff
yeah she she does play with some of these things at home
yeah i mean that's what and
so she might be looking for things that are a little familiar
she didn't seem to um like this container too much
how does she do with books at home
does she like that sort of thing yet
um she she's not really that interested in in being read to
she likes to kinda move around and and ah explore the room more so than sitting and being read to
so that might not be her thing
yeah
does she have any ah
unfortunately i don't get a lot of one on time with her
and it seems like whenever i do sit down to read her sisters kinda push her out of the way
um so which makes me sad
so that that might be why she's a little bit more like off on her own doing things
yeah
maybe it's her personality too
yeah it could be a little bit
she might not at least at this age
you know we'll keep offering these things when you come back for visits
and it'll be interesting to see
um does she have any um baby dolls at home
um haha she doesn't have any of her own
she has a teddy bear um
yeah we have we have some baby dolls at home
we have about probably at least six or seven of them
we have quite a few
yeah yeah
they float around
um she's got her her stuffed animals
she's got her little teddy bear that she loves
and ah
but you didn't see one of those today
no teddy
did she like any of those um animals over there
um she didn't seem to be that interested in any of 
kind of just gave a passing she liked this one best i think
yeah
she liked that one best
does she do animals sounds
is that what she liked
she doesn't do we do sa we do some yeah
saw you doing with the puppy like woof woof
yeah
ellie
ellie
you're just a star
i think she wants to be on
she wants to haha
ellie where you going
so she liked that for a second
hi there
especially when you did that ribbit thing i think she liked
she liked that
does she recognize that do you think
do you say like
s ah sometimes
ahhah
a little bit yeah
maybe it was just a funny sound
is it gonna stay up
haha giovanna is monitoring that still there
hi
haha pink puppy
pink baby
yeah are you a little pink baby today
she found th did she find this on her own
yeah
she did
she did
yeah
you have this kind of thing at home
yeah um we have we have some
she doesn't drink from a cup a lot
but she does a little sometimes
like a regular cup or a sippy cup
um both
sometimes i'll hold up a regular cup for her to drink from
and um sometimes she drinks from a sippy cup
but she's
that looks a little bit familiar huh
haha your size you might not get too much out of that but
this one's just pretend
let's see if there an um
she's certainly seen sippy cups around the house for sure
so would you say that these kinds of toys at least as far as what we're offering here are sor suit her personality the best
what she's interested in
i think so yeah
so she's kind of active and
yeah
maybe it reminds you of
she likes to hold hold different things
it could be that i mean that's the right size for her hand too
yeah yeah
oh you found something else
oh you've got a
oh what did you find
some pizza
yeah you haven't tried any pizza yet
i'm not sure if i asked you this already
do you do you think there are any of these toys um or objects that she knows the name of
i don't think so
that doesn't look that real
some of them do like that one's a little more real
yeah
or how that
would she know the name of that
i don't think so
she hasn't really been exposed to ice
there's plenty of time for that
haha yeah she's sort of still just starting on you know finger foods and stuff
so she doesn't really know a lot
lot of different kinds
of food names
yeah
how cheerios
do you know that name
haha she looked right at the box
yeah you know cheerios don't you
haha whoa
you know that one
yeah you know some words
yeah
okay and which um type of toy do you think was least interesting to her
ah she seemed to be least interested in the doll
in the doll yeah
yeah she didn't really even glance at that
took a passing glance into this box and looked at th the one book a little
yeah
for a second
you didn't really do anything with that dolly
i wonder what will happen next time
um i think i did i miss anything
i think that's good okay
so now i'm just going to ask you a few questions
i'm not going to write anything down
because it's all going to be recorded
so which of the toys seem to interest him the most
um the pizza
the slices of pizza yeah
does he like pizza
no he's never had pizza
but i think he likes the you know he's teething
so he likes yeah the way it feels
on his gums i think
right
everything in the mouth
so which of the toys do you think is a good one for his personality
um
uh let's see
he likes the ones like the rattle with the noise
he likes those
um he generally likes toys
that make noise
either like music or
things that rattle like this
so
um anything that makes noise
okay
um and why do you think it interests him
because because they make noise and they're
yeah
um which of the toys seem to interest him the least
the stuffed animals
um he didn't really he wasn't very interested in them
why do you think that is
is there a reason
i think its maybe it's because i don't know if he knows that this is you know soft plastic
and he can put it in his mouth
um he's doesn't show interest in stuffed animals
he shows interest in wheels
he likes the cars at home
he likes to spin wheels
right
he likes balls
he likes yeah
um do you think that there are any items here
that his interests in have changed since the last time you were here
or do you remember what you played with last time
um
what did we play with last time
last well last last time i remember the toys were in the bo the bins
and he really liked coming up to the bins and
looking inside
um i don't think he was that interested in the stuffed animals
i think he he was
i think last time he liked the bee a little more
i think
i remember playing with this a lot
um cause i these are all the same toys aren't they
so you asked me did did his interests change
right
um
i think yeah
little bit i think he lost interest
you know he wanted to come over here
more often where last time he was he wasn't crawling but he sat and he wanted to see what was in the bins
okay
which book would he prefer to read or look at with you or which book did he prefer
um he looked at the good night moon
um i thought he would like this one with the touch and feel
right
but he lost interest in it
okay
on the farm
whoops
does he play with similar toys at home now or
yeah he plays with um
as you see i've given up
um he plays with um we do have some fr plastic fruit
and it has a shopping basket
and he likes to empty it
and he likes to bounce them off the floor
so some of the plastic fruit is the same
at home
um at home he doesn't really play with the stuffed animals
he does play with his sister's dolls
and some books
okay
do you think that he prefers books or toys
toys
does he play with any dolls at home
you said he plays
yeah sometimes
i mean he comes up and he picks them up
and he he'll chew on their feet and
he'll touch their eyes
look
look at the peekaboo
he doesn't pretend to feed
he does play with um some plastic food
okay
do you think he recognized any of the foods
either from home or from last time or anything
no
he doesn't eat pizza
no
he might have recognized the plates
we have those at home
okay
um at this point do you think he recognizes the names of any of these items
is he beginning to recognize the names of anything
no i don't think so
maybe baby
and book
but i don't think so
i don't think he's really like you know if i said go p play with the baby
i don't think he would look for the baby
do you think there are any items that aren't necessarily here that he does recognize the names of
um
maybe ball
yeah cause we have those at home
and car
and birdie
we look out the window at the birds at the bird feeder
so if i say
where are the birdies
he looks over at the window
okay
psst
alright that's it
so i just have a couple questions for you
okay
okay so are were there any toys that he seemed interested last time but this time
last time he was really interested in the stuffed animals
um which i thought was odd he doesn't really play with stuffed animals at home
but this time he completely ignored them
um
what did he seem the most interested in this time
this time i was really surprised that he went for this first
because last time he didn't really care about it
um
you don't have any dolls at home
no
um and last time the thing he was most interested in were the food things
like the peas i remember he really liked
and i think some of that i'm not sure he knows it's food
i think it's nice to chew on
everything goes in his mouth
and he also really liked the keys last time
um which we didn't actually have before our visit
um but after the visit we ended up going and buying him some keys
and um he usually loves books
and he just i think it's because there's all these new toys he s just doesn't care about the books
but at home he's we read a lot
so you don't think he recognizes the names of any of these
i don't think so no
not yet
i mean he eats peas
but i'm not sure that he knows what they look like because he usually eats them mashed up
he's just kinda started to eat them as finger food
um
the spaghetti
yeah
which i mean he has pasta
he's never had spaghetti
so i don't i really don't think he knows that that's spaghetti
i think he just likes to chew on it
no i was wondering that
but i don't think he can
okay oh you want my pen
the other thing i thought was really interesting
and i don't know if this this could've been just me trying to do it more
but it looked like he was trying to put the food onto the plate
which surprised me because he doesn't
he's still too young
we don't give him i mean if we cut up food that he uses as finger food we just put it on his tray of his highchair
he doesn't i mean if i gave him a plate he'd chuck it onto the floor
but that coulda just been me wishing
okay and the animals do you think he recognizes any of the animals' names
or the books
i don't think so yet
no
do you have any of these toys at home
um the k we've got keys
we've obviously got books
and um we have stuffed animals
but none of these specific ones
but we don't have any food toys yet
hah look what i just spotted
there's a ball here that i didn't even notice
balls are usually his favorite
jack look at what we missed
look
exactly
now if we had noticed that we probably would've played with that the whole time
that's okay
alright
so is the next one at one year
or is it at like eighteen months
this is your second visit right
right
the next will actually be eleven months
oh so next month
okay
and then the fourth one will be when he's
two
okay
haha good times buddy
look at this ball
alright
good job jack
thank you so much for being so good
okay so at this point it's been about fifteen minutes
so now i'm just gonna ask you a few questions
um i'm not gonna write down anything cause it will all be on the recorder
so the first question is which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most
the food
the food
which do you think is a good toy for her personality
among the food choice or just
in general
um i i i think i think the the food toys are good for her cause she likes doing stuff that she sees us do
she tries to do everything
but she sees us do
which is why it doesn't surprise me at all where when she when she played with the microphone first it's like tv remotes
right
cell phones palm pilots it's like oh mommy and daddy are playing with those
that makes sense
yes
so and food is obviously something we spend a lot of time with
which of the toys seemed to interest her the least
oh she didn't even look at the baby doll
or oh she didn't notice the books either did i
so
right
that whole bin
that whole bin in general
yeah
why do you think that is
i can't tell you for sure she may simply not have noticed them
she she she was right by the stuffed animals when we put her down
and then she saw the food and didn't seem to look up again after that
so i'm not sure if there's anything uninteresting here
right
although she i've noticed in the last couple months that she's definitely not into books when i do try to read to her she closes them
and i think that's more just lack of you know motor control
but it's hard to finish a story so she doesn't know how cool stories can be
we haven't read a whole lot or i should never haven't finished a whole lot of books
um okay
do you think that there are any items that her interests have changed in since the last time you were here
i don't think so i remember playing with the food a lot
yeah
i think she was a little more into books then
right
mostly cause she i think she haven't learned how to close them yet
i'm looking forward to reading to her again but
we're definitely in a stage where that's not working
so so she's less interested in books than she was
okay and more interested in the food you would say
or equally
probably equally maybe a little more
okay
um the next question is about books
which
book would your child prefer to read or look at
she she likes anything
that has a good rhythm to it
like i remember mister brown can move
from last time and
at home um
uh i'm not even remembering which books go over better
nothings going well right now as i already said twice
um but if it's a story
that reads like
interesting
but if it's something that has more of a rhythm she
she likes that
more interesting
yeah
does she play with similar toys at home
she really likes big toys at this point like pushing her little tigger plane around
or she has another walker um she likes emptying kitchen cupboards
taking out things like pitch plastic pitchers and
jars and stuff
so she's more into big big stuff
yeah
um and at this point you would say she prefers toys over books
definitely definitely
does she play with any dolls at home
nuhhuh
do you ever play with pretend food or pretend to feed dolls at home
no we haven't
do you think that she recognized any of the foods from the last time or from home
good question
i want to give her real peas but we haven't done that yet
um so so she wouldn't know that these are the things she likes
she loves peas
um
no
i don't think so i don't think she recognizes those
cause for instance we don't eat ice cream off cones
right
so
and and spaghetti goes through the blender before she gets it
so
yeah no i don't think recognizes them
oh the bottle
she used to drink bottles
that's been a while
she started eating solid food at four months and stopped having a bottle like the same day
wow
yeah
so she still breast feeds
but that bottle thing she much rather have cereal
okay
um let's see
at this point do you think she recognizes the names of any of these items or she
or are there any other items that maybe aren't here that you think she would recognize the name of
i think she knows cereal
um which means cheerios
the stuff that you mix up with formula and feed to her in a in a spoon i think that's food and not cereal
but cereal
um
and other than that it's hard to say cause she loves loves loves mashed up peas
but when you tell her she's about to have peas does she really know that's going to be different than spaghetti
right
i'm not absolutely sure but she smiles when you say peas
so she might know peas
that's spaghetti
only it tastes like plastic
um
i think she knows dog
that's different than food but she has two puppies
i think she knows dog
great
yeah
she may have said her first word yesterday
well she
wow
we've taken all of two weeks of sign language class
and the sign for all done is like this and she waved her hand and said
and i was like
that counts
she hasn't repeated it yet though it could have just been a fluke
i i uh as the proud mom of course i want to say was all done
yeah that's what i wanted to say because well i just think think you're fabulous
but if she does it again then i'll then i'll
really say it
yeah
just a few things that might be a little bit different from last time
okay
which toys seemed to interest him the most
do you think
this po like anything that he could the stuff that was he could pick up
pretty easily
um things that make a noise when they hit together
if they don't do that he kinds tends to just throw it off to the side
um and which of the toys do you think interests him the least
um the stuff animals
okay
except for the bumble bee
and i think that's just cause of this this is more fun than something that's you know kind of plan
and um does he ever play books at home or do you ever read books to him at home
yeah and i always do that at um like be at bedtime is when we do books so
something he normally plays with plays with during the day it's always it's a night time thing
books are
and um were there any items that you would think hey
jack
jack
come here
were there any items that you think he didn't know the name of
and if so which ones
didn't know i see i don't think he's at an age where i don't know if he really recognizes any it's hard for me to tell if he does
like he knows what his what the cheerios box looks like i don't know if it's because i'm saying cheerios
there's a bow on my shoe
he is obsessed with shoes i'll tell you that
hey
can i take the microphone off
i actually need you to
just cause i'm not writing down the answers
um do you have any toys like these at home and which ones do you think are similar to ones
we have books we have i mean i wouldn't say we have toys but i let him play with anything in the kitchen
but like little plastic plates measuring spoons measuring cups that cor that kind of stuff
open up basically open up the tupperware cabinet so i think stuff like this
this and this he was kind of he seemed to like to play with that kind of stuff
so
um do you think that he prefers books or toys in general i guess you said books were more at night but
i think toys in general yeah
um do you ever play with pretend food or pretend to feed dolls at home and what do you do
i don't really pret i don't have any dolls for him at home
i think he is liking that ice cone because he has a tooth coming in so he's like putting the pressure back there
that's really all i have
and thanks for coming in someone will i guess contact you about the next visit
okay
alright
i have some questions for you
he can keep playing while we while we talk
okay he did a nice drool like right into the box
we'll clean it out
haha thanks for letting us know
it's like then he's going to goop up everything and then like right out of his mouth
okay so um i'm just gonna ask you a little bit about the types of toys and things he likes to play with at here and at home
okay
so which of the toys that we had here do you think interested him the most
he's still on the ones he can chew
the firmer ones
i think actually he picked out the frog last time he didn't pick out any of these soft ones
but he still likes he still likes the hard things he can chew
he likes to shake the froggy
haha um which of the toys do you think he'd be least interested in
he likes the electronics the best yes
um i guess as toys still the stuffed animals overall he's less interested in
do you do you think there's a reason for that or
um i don't know i mean
at home he he's got some at home that he that he likes
they're um
but he doesn't play with them for a long time
like he'll pat or like bite on it for a minute
and then and then he's off to something else
um i don't know i think maybe he's still teething and likes the hard stuff
so you think that he's stayed pretty consistent since last time
um yeah i think so
i'm trying to think what else we've got
i mean now he's more into the you know the move and do stuff
so now he's also into like climbing on things and um
banging things together and um
um he didn't do any of that here for you but he'll
we've got a tray table at home bang things on the table or
um she likes to he likes to we've got a couple of shaky things he likes to make noise
i saw you looking at some books too
do you think there's any books that he likes
yes i think he has favorite books
he does not care for good night
boring boring
um but yeah he's got some books that he likes
um he likes ones with animals
he likes the animals
do you think he liked any of the ones we have here
i think he was interested in that one
i think he was having fun with the with the flaps
um i see you have good night and i didn't pull that out 
i used to try to read that to him before he go to bed
and he'd start just squirming like crazy
and then i read um other ones and he's and he's fine
i read him the an i love book that has a fox picture of a fox and picture of cats
and every time the the fox makes the cat's hair all stand up on end he's acting crazy
whenever we get to that page he giggles
haha i saw that he didn't go for the doll at all
no interested in a doll
how gender horrible is that i don't have any dolls for him
um i have a doll i can break the doll out
i had a doll when i was making sure that the dogs weren't going to attack a baby
i bought a little baby
i haven't given him a doll
how horrible
that's okay
you can have a doll if you want a doll
does he um i saw that he was playing with the pretend food here
does he play with similar types of things at home
you know i haven't gotten pretend food
he's got mostly um
he's got balls
and he's got um
hah um like like i've got some like plasticy books he likes to chew on
um i don't have any pretend food
he has things that are like this i've got a foam mat
that it says this is not a chew toy
haha and he really likes to chew on that
i try not to let him chew on that but
do you think that he would recognize the name of any of the items that we have here
hah i don't know
ah i don't know
if he might recognize froggy or kitty or doggy or something
maybe but i i don't know how he would show that he knows it
what about any of the types of food
do you think he would know
he still kinda eats mush
he eats banana
but you don't have a banana
no banana
and he clearly he's never had an ice cone
he was going for the wrong end of the ice
he knows the business end of that
okay so you don't think he would recognize these
i don't think so
i don't think so
he um the an i think the things that he's most likely to recognize would be like animal names and stuff
like ki kitty and dog
i think are the most um the most talked about things in our house
kitty and doggies
i think that's all my questions for today
okay
that the cookie
we're all done
can i take this off
you can take you can leave it there we're done
just so i don't
oh okay
yeah
you keep playing
um so i just wanted to ask you
there's been a little time since you were here last i think he's around ten months now
yeah he's ten months
do you i don't know if you remember what it was like when you were here before
but do you notice any changes in his interest in this stuff
like is he more interested in s things this time than he was last time or
i mean he's still putting everything in his mouth
yeah
i mean that's still where he is
he's using some things appropriately
like he recognizes now he's eating food more regularly
so he recognized the spoon
and which and he put the right side of the spoon in his mouth
and he did that with the bottle and the sippy cup
and i think last time he was kind of just chewing on everything
okay
and now he's chewing on the bottom of the bottle but
but there's some recognition
yeah
baba
and he went from books
um he does spend a lot of time with books
um at home
but again they often wind up in his mouth too
but he can flip through the pages and stuff
oh really
he doesn't the only time we really do dolls is to keep him interested on the changing table
so and he doesn't have a baby doll at home
so
do you think he was interested in
well he was definitely interested in the face
um he's he always seems interested in like eyes
when he saw the clock he touched the eyes
and when he saw the baby he touched the eyes
and he does that with a couple of his books too
i don't know what it is about eyes
um i think he was a little interested in the face at first
he was touching all the different parts
and the mouth
but then again then he just wanted to to lick it
i heard you doing something about feeding the baby
did that did was he interested in that
i don't know if he realized what i was doing
i mean i was just trying to model
he doesn't really do any pretend play yet
but um
and it was when i gave something to the baby then he wanted it in his mouth so
right okay
so he doesn't wanna miss out on anything
um let's see
so at this point in his development what do you think
oh he's
now he's giving
you giving the baby the baba
that's so nice you're sharing
at this point in development what do you think is best sorts of toys for his personality and his stage of development
excuse you
um i mean he's really for the most part interested in a lot of gross motor things
so now he wants to
i mean what he chooses at home are kind of the big things
things that he can pull up on
things he can climb over
plays with balls and blocks a lot
um and he has a bunch of toys that you know if you do something to them they make a noise or something
he likes those
and he's got a fish bowl that he puts the fish in and out of that he likes
um bangs stuff together
i mean it's still a lot of making noise
oh yeah i saw that
i saw him doing that a little bit
like when you put him to bed we have a couple um put a couple like chewy toys in his bed with him
and he bangs them on his crib for a little while before he falls asleep
and that's just playing
i mean he's not angry
that's just how he's entertaining himself
he likes to put through and watch fall to the floor
so i think now that he's only been crawling for a few weeks
so i think he's realizing that he can get new perspectives on things
so i think he's kind of just exploring that
um pulling himself up on everything
pulling himself up on stairs
it's opening up a lot of possibilities for him
yeah
i mean he loves to sit in the kitchen and play with the tupperware and things like that
okay so speaking of the kitchen um i don't know if you have these kinds of toys at home
we don't
was he interested in the dishes the food just the whole thing
or what do you think
he seemed to go for the food more
yeah
okay
um well the pizza is kind of what the pizza and the cookies kept him for the most part
and why do you think is there some quality of the toy itself
or do you think he recognizes
he's never had pizza
he doesn't eat these foods yet
um i think the this has a little give
so it was nice to chew on
um i think the fact that there were a couple of was kind of interesting to him
but no he doesn't eat any pizza or cookies yet
do you think um colors attract him at all
i noticed the pizzas are kind of colorful
yeah that c that could be
and i'm just wondering if you've noticed that at home either
i mean everything at home is colorful
all of his toys are colorful but
true
oh he just he just pooped
don't put your fingers in it
yeah that's exciting
let's see
so you did look at the book a little bit
he you said he wasn't so interested in that
he wasn't that interested in it
but he does books at home
he does do books
and we do books as part of his nighttime routine
and then he also has books um just like in his toy chest
and he'll pull out and we put all the touchy feely books in his toy chest
so he'll go through and touch the things
and eventually just chew on the book
and you said he likes to turn pages
he does turn pages
alright
yeah honey we're not gonna chew on that that could get ruined
here chew on the pizza
so would you say he prefers books or toys
he prefers toys i think
okay
and you i think you said he doesn't have um d he has some things like this on the changing table but
yeah but it's really just for us to keep him occupied while he's changing
okay and no baby dolls at home
okay so this one was new
this was new yeah
and he'll do the same thing when he sees a baby too
he'll wanna touch the face
and even when he sees kids socially
he'll always wants to go for their face
i think really tiny infants are really attracted to the face
but when he sees kids he wants to touch their face
right
and so he doesn't have dolls
so he doesn't pretend to feed dolls at home
does he oh and do you have pretend food
or no
okay so he doesn't do that
so you said he doesn't really eat these kinds of food
what do you
but he he eats peas
oh he eats peas okay
but i mean he's still doing a lot of
i think he pooped
it stinks
um his food is mostly pureed now too though
the only things he kind of eats in chunks are like strawberries and pears
so he wouldn't he wouldn't really recognize ice or bread or anything
he wouldn't recognize that
his food is all still pretty little
okay
let's see
do you think there's any um like you said he's he used the spoon appropriately
are there any words names here that he would you think he might recognize
like spoon or bread or some of the things that you were saying
of the stuff here
yeah
um baba is probably the
baba and then um the sippy cup
okay
um i don't know that i ever talked to him about spoons
um no he only has bowls
he doesn't have plates
okay
um i think that might be all the questions that i have
okay mommy's gonna
which would you say would interest him the least
these things here
i think so
okay
i think that's it
anything that i should know that um about his toy preferences um other than what you've told me
um
i don't think so
okay
well we'll get another chance to do this f at your next visit
um which
i mean should i get some of these things
would that
no no that's okay
th we were sort of interested in how
this stuff i stuff i think is still a little old for him
yeah
he'll come back at two years also
so no we'll just see how his interests change and grows
and develops
we should probably get him a baby doll
so that he learns about body parts and stuff like that
he seems to like it
he has i mean he's got stuffed animals at home
but nothing that's humanlike
so that's probably a good idea
alright well we can be all done
i'm gonna change him before we go
i just have a few questions for you
okay
okay so since his last visit have you did you notice any difference as far as interest in the different toys
he seemed more interested this time in i don't know
i can't remember what he was
i don't remember what was here last time if there was food or not
we had the exact same toys
okay
so i'm just wondering if you if anything comes to mind
like some of them come and they just like playing with one thing the entire time
and like the next visit they pick some other one thing
but it seems like he's
he he seemed pretty diverse
he liked the spoon for quite a while
um i don't i like i said i don't remember what he played with last time
today so he seemed most interested would you say in the food toys or in the stuffed animals or
um i think the food held his attention the longest
so that's probably what he was most interested in
okay
which toys did he seem the least interested in
um i guess the books
he didn't really even touch them at all
okay
do you think there are any items that he recognizes the names for now
there are a few things
but i i like you know different foods that he eats he seems to be excited about
but i don't know that he he really recognizes them
or if he's just hungry and wants food you know
um it's hard to hard to tell sometimes
so what food items do you think he's familiar with
i know they don't look exactly like
right
yeah i mean he's been having he's been having peas you know not all mashed up but like that
um and he's had spaghetti
but you know it doesn't look anything like that
he's had some bread and he's seen me pull it apart
but i don't know
i don't know that anything really stands out
what's wrong
look
wanna try that
wanna try that
maybe
let's see what else we have
do you have any of these toys at home
um his brother has a food set
not exactly the same but
what about the books
are there any books that you see here that
um we have put me to the zoo but not as a board book
we have lots of doctor seuss but
and we have the foot book
and we have some books about the farm
farm animals and
from the animals do you think he recognizes any names
we have a couple books with a frog
but his older brother doesn't like stuffed animals
so we don't keep them very long
okay
uh yeah
he might have recognized the frog from a book
does he play with pretend food with his brother ever
play with it in terms of mouth it and take it around the room yes
okay i think that's all we have for you today
okay
let's go see what your brother's up to
all right buddy
sure
basically just about the toys she plays
um what do you think was her favorite toy today
um she seemed to like the peas
do you have like um pretend foods at home
no
um what do you think was her least favorite thing
um i mean she didn't touch a lot of the other foods but i wouldn't say there was anything she disliked
i guess the stuffed animals maybe
how about the books
um we read this one
and she liked touching the the pieces
um she likes to turn pages too
do you have any books like those at home
that she might recognize
yeah yeah yeah
yup and she's at home she's depending on how tired she is she's she'll reach out and touch the pages
the more tired she is the more likely she is to wanna sit and read
otherwise she just wants to close it and then open it to a different page and close it and open it where she wants
do you think she recognizes the names of any of these toys
no
do you have any toys like this at home
um we have keys at home
and she's got a bunch of stuffed animals
um we have plastic toys
um you know like stacking cups and um various other things
and so that's probably why she was banging them
she likes to bang her toys at home
does she have any dolls at home
no she doesn't
but we're trying you know go over body parts with her and stuff
and so that's why i was showing her the body parts on the doll and herself
have there been any changes um in her like toys that she plays with at home since like the last visit
um
does she have any like different toys
yeah she has some walking toys now
um like a push toy
most of the toys that we have at home don't have any batteries
so it's just v you know various takes on spinning wheels and um you know stacking things
um she's got a little farm set up like foam foam animals
and she likes those
um but she doesn't recognize them yet
i mean she has favorites that she picks up
but i think that's more shape that fits into her hand easier than um than a preference for an animal
so you wouldn't say that there's any names of toys here that she recognizes
no
what are you going after now
pizza
hamburger
well that's good
you started with breakfast
and now you're moving to lunch or dinner
oh the hamburger huh
and the waffle
i don't know if that would be yummy together
okay so that was it
thank you so much for coming in
you're welcome
i hope she had fun
did you get your prize
yeah
okay
questions i have
okay
i think
you're good on time it's like
oh we're good yeah
and i have time to change this diaper he's making
okay
i'm just gonna ask your mom some questions okay lucas
um well um i think we asked you this last time too but which this visit which toys do you think interested him the most
this clock thing was pretty major
um and then he liked the two things that he could bang together those two blocks he does a lot of that at home
i would say
and um why do you think those things in particular any ideas
i thi this was new
you know this was different
haven't seen that before
haven't seen that before
although we have like cl i mean he's yeah i mean we don't have like the clock puzzle out or anything for him
and he likes to bang things together i'm not sure if that was part of it and there are lots of dolls at home you know i was surprised to see him kind of pull her up and try to
help her sit up
um i think my daughter does that to him
oh that's interesting
yeah
does he usually play with dolls at home or try
he's trying to get her stuff all the time so it doesn't matter what he has in front of him he's trying to go for
what he's not supposed to have so
so he plays with whatever she
right i mean he's got you know pink phone whatever it is like there's nothing
as long as she has it
as long as she has it or
that's attractive
okay
but your sister wasn't here with you today
so that's an interesting thing to see what you'll do without her
yeah if he'll go for
um which of the toys here do you think he would be interested the least
overall books right now
are not his thing like i have to kind of read to him usually from a distance he wants to grab it
tear pages or ri you know or eat it so
even the fpcar even the hard page books like this you know
kind of sit him at a distance to try get a few books in
before he wants to destroy them
so books would probably be at the bottom
um and i heard you saying something um about having like dishes and food toys and stuff like that at home
we don't have a lot of the food stuff we have dishes yes and i just thought maybe
he would want to play with those since
you know at home she doesn't want him playing with that
you want to stand up today is today the day
type of stuff but not that one
right and my yeah my daughter is at like that point where she is trying to learn to tell time and stuff
but li it's there's nothing around that's in his area to play i mean we have one of those clock puzzles you know where you just put the pieces in where the times go
but it's too small for him to be handling it yet and i don't even think he's seen it
so i'm imagining that that was just maybe the novelty of it and the face and the you know the co the colors
yeah
okay and let's see
um if he w were to hear a bo you were to do a book with him at home are there any that you think he likes more than others like are there standard ones or things that
he likes to hear often
he likes the you know he li i mean the stuff that rhymes you know like there's there's a um like the pajama time the sandra boynton stuff
we have a few of those the rhyming stuff is kind of the sing songy
type things he will listen and he is i'm fi i'm finding that his attention span attention span is getting better
and um so he do i'm like oh i have to go back to trying that because in the beginning i was like oh this is just too frustrating for me to have him you know
wanna tear out pages
i know wha you are going after buddy i know
you want that microphone don't you
that wouldn't be good for a guy like you
um
does he play with his sister's dolls at all i mean
he might look interested in them but i guess um
i don't know yeah i don't know if he's only going for it he knows that's she has one in particular that she carries around with her all the time
and you know and it has a bl you know she has a blanket that is kind of her little security thing
and um i think he might want it she always has it
i don't really know
the toy itself i don't know if he would be really interactive you know and try to
okay
try to do some playing with
right but i don't think so
although i was surprised by what he did with her
yeah yeah there seems to be something going on
he doesn't play with the baby yet does he
um let's see oh do you think he recognizes the names for any of these types of items
not really you know
on that questionaire um i said maybe he would understand book or maybe he would understand water or milk but i
don't i'm not really sure about that
it sounded like he was trying to say clock but he was probably just
imitating the word yeah i
i was like that would be really surprising if today right here would be his first word you know
he seemed to be having fun playing that kind of game with you though
yeah and you know the imitating
and having a little conversation back and forth
yeah lucas
do you know where the clock is
where's the clock
huh
do you know where the clock is
can you find the clock
my goodness you're right
so maybe
but i just
now my husband is really into clocks and stuff but we haven't really done any like focus like we're gonna learn you know
like we got the right yeah i mean this is not something that we
if he is particularly good at clock things at this point
no exactly we're not looking into we're not we're not trying to design his profession today
determine his future career goals
um if you if you had him on your lap with a book would he would he turn pages himself or would he like you to read it read it to him
which one do you think he would prefer
um i think he would try to turn the pages himself
yeah he's not real patient with
alright i think that's all
that i was gonna ask you
and um oh i know one last question i don't know exactly what he played with the first time but
um do you think his interests in toys or anything of these things have changed
since the last time he was here
he played more this time i don't remember what happened last time
that he just to not really be i don't know if it was just the time of i don't know what it was
but he just wasn't so into it that it was hard for me to get him interested in anything so i read to him a little bit
i did this i did that but he just seemed to
more interested in the objects
right i mean today you know i sit him down and he's like i'm gonna go for something and there's just you know a lot of variety to choose from
and last time i don't know what the variety was but there was a lot
and he just seemed to not i i seemed to have to bring things to him and show him and try to engage him
this time he seemed to direct it
i mean this thing is phenomenal
i think that's all needed to do so
alright that should be good
hi
oh she's found one thing that she w
that's okay
okay so i just have a few questions to ask you
okay
um i'm not gonna write anything down because
okay
um which of the toys seemed to interest your child the most
um i think after she felt the hair on that
haha
that became her ah new favorite
um
i think the texture she likes of it
which is a good toy for her personality
um she tends to like her baby dolls at home
she likes to give hugs and kisses and all that to her baby doll but
a little bit smaller than this but
that one's like the size of her
yeah
yeah but we don't have any of the food stuff yet
so i think she's kind of not really sure
okay
more than just kind of hitting them
she likes to make noises and stuff
but active
so she likes to do things
right
um so which of the toys seemed to interest her the least
um stuffed animals don't
i mean she just kind of likes to hug 
and throw throw aside
okay
i think it's more shh i think the last time i was saying she uses them more at night
so i think she doesn't really see as play time
um which book did she prefer to play with
um she loves these kind
i mean although i guess i kind of picked it out for her
but looking at different ones she seemed to like this one the most
she likes to do that with the flaps
okay
haha it looks like it yeah
good job
is there any reason why
is it because of the flaps or
i guess we do i mean we have similar ones at home
so i guess just from she's used to them
and doing something with 
turning the pages she likes to do a lot
but especially with the flaps kind of adds something to it
and the bottle
you really wanted to feed yourself
yeah
are you hungry
we're working on sippy
so i don't know if that kind of she thinks is a different kind of
oh okay
um
were there any items you think your child's never seen before
i guess maybe the
i mean she's seen i mean like at her cousin's house
but we don't have any at our house
okay
i mean she's seen them
okay
are there any kinds of food that she's seen that she's played with before
i think she just likes things that she can hold
like the smaller ones that she can put in her hands
yeah
that kind of bang together
okay um
where are you going
so for all the toys do you have any favorite things at home
i mean i know you said that
um the book
we do have keys
the last time we were here she would not put these keys down
um we do have keys similar to this
but she's not as attached lately as she was when she was younger
um haha what do ya want
you want that now
but nothing like too i mean just similar books similar little toys
okay
where are you going
do you think your child prefers books or toys
um i think different times of days
i mean we read her a lot of books at night
so at night she prefers books
i think she's just used to routine
but during the day
she's at daycare during the day
four days a week i think mainly toys and stuff
i think it varies
what's she in the mood for
and baby dolls
that's for everyone yeah
starting to do the whole baby doll thing lately
where are you going
do you ever play with do you ever pretend to feed the dolls at home
um yeah we do at times with like her bottles
and at times she'll try to stick the bottle towards their mouth
don't eat the books
she likes to eat everything right now
and what does she like to do with the dolls other than try to feed them
mainly just hug them
we have a little cradle that she'll put the baby in
kind of rock it
rock the bassinet with the baby in it
and we have a little stroller that like pushes a baby doll
and she'll put the baby doll in the stroller
so i think she kind of acts it out
what we do to her
um for the on the farm book has she seen any of the animals in the book before
and if so which ones
um not seen in person
but just through books
the different animals
oh she's seen dogs
i don't know if there's a dog in there
haha getting a little rough with the baby
okay
you could leave it on so i don't have to take notes but i'll just ask you questions now and raina can play
she's more interested in my mic
she's like there's something new on your shirt i want that
i know
you can't have that
can i ask mom some questions
so the first question i have for you is whether you've noticed any changes in her preferences for toys since the last time
um or whether you think she's playing with the toys differently then she was the last time she was here
um i think the last time we were here she didn't really play she just kind sat and i just kind handed her things where now she's pulling things
and now that we're done with that you're gonna talk
get down yes get down
um now she's picking
like she wanted the frog she saw it she went after it
she really wants the door knob
oh
so while we're in here she wants she really likes the door knobs at home
so that's where she's going
and so what does she do just
she wants to she just wants to get to the knobs any knob
she's very interested in knobs
dresser drawers she pulls them open and dumps all of the clothes out
and we have um an armoire in the living room that has the knobs on
she walks she holds on to the knobs and walks
she really likes door knobs
i'm not really sure what it is about the shiny things but
she's into it
she saw it first that's why i kept trying to turn around
she was gonna go for the door
it's like i want that
see she's still lookin at it
so she'd rather have that than any of these toys
than any of it yeah
she would take that if i let her play with that knob the whole time we were here she would play with it
it's like you can't have that between that and this microphone
yeah
alright well clearly there were some other things that interested her besides these but of these toys what do you think she was most interested in
uh anything that makes noise
so she really liked the keys and the spoons because they make noise
she shook the bottle but it didn't make any noise
right it didn't make any noise
and she did play with the frog and the rooster
you gonna beat me up with winnie the
so she liked um these two things here yeah
the noise
i think they were the only things that made noise
she had the waffles and she banged them and then she put them down
and now she um is looking at something else now that we're talking but okay
it's i put her over here
i think when i sat her in the middle there's so many choices
she didn't know
she's familar with the baby doll we have one at home
so she went straight for that
that's what i was gonna ask you too actually
um of these toys do you have for instance dishes play food or anything like that
no i actually don't have play food
i thought she was a little young for play food since she still puts everything in her mouth
we don't have play food but we have lots of things that
we have keys and things like that that makes noise and little balls that go in the little things and she bangs them
can you say thank you
no
you're thinking about it
you can't eat the paper
and so she doesn't have these types of things but she has a baby doll
yeah she has a doll and she has keys and we have a few stuffed animals but not not very many
and how interested is she in those at home
um she carries the baby doll around but she leaves it
she likes to bang things
she's really into anything that makes noise so that's why she kept going back to the keys
she's very sociable
so she kept going back to those things that made noise
yeah that's pretty much
i tried to get her to play with the pizza the book
we have books and stuff at home
do you read them
at night usually at bedtime
she has her favorite book so she really wasn't i don't usually read during the day but when we're going to bed
she gets a book so
if this was more like bedtime
she probably would've sat but she sat there but she didn't pull away
she opened this one and then she closed it back i started readin it she closed it back up
she's like okay i'm done with that
and i read this one a couple of these pages of this one
but she wasn't paying any attention so i put it back
okay
and which of these toys do you think are good for her personality
um there all probably good for her
she just right now only likes the noise making ones
okay
i don't even know why just very interesting
we were just discussing that at home
anything i have maracas they make noise
i have clappers
everything that makes noise a variety of things but she always goes for the noise makers
she's gonna be loud
yeah
just tells me she's gonna be loud
yeah
you're very quiet no talking
um which do you think interested her the least
um i dunno she was into some of them
but not very many
how much
the books
well but i think more because she's accustomed to getting a book at night and it's not
okay
so you'd say the stuffed animals probably
yeah
do you think there are any of these items that she would recognize the name for
um outside of the baby doll probably not
and maybe book she probably knows she knows what a book is
okay
so when i say on the bed
i put the book on the bed and she goes and pulls the book when it's time to go to bed
she pulls out we have the global baby's book
and it just has pictures of babies in it
and she opens it and points to the babies
so i think she would recognize that book as a book but i don't know that she would recognize other things as a book
i see okay and how the bottle
well she is nursed so she doesn't really gets a bottle
so she was interested in it but not because she recognized it
right we don't normally she's maybe had well she actually had a bottle the other day
so i don't think she was that interested
okay
yeah
she doesn't recognize it because we don't use it enough
so you think she was looking for it to make noise
yeah she kept turning it over and i think she was interested in the bubbles
but it makes bubbles
oh
so once she saw it make bubbles she was trying to get to the bubbles
and now she's trying to open the baby doll's eyes
ours doesn't the eyes don't close on our doll
she's gonna clean it up
she's into everything
back to the bottle
so there were some items you think she probably hasn't seen or heard of before
yeah probably most of the food
i mean we have real food at home but none of the
like she's seen pizza before
we've eaten the pizza but no it doesn't look like the pizza we've had
but the food i mean we don't i don't know maybe i should get food for home but we don't have we have stuffed animal and baby dolls and books but we don't have the food so
its just more to see whether these are novel items or if there completely new to her or whether they are something she plays with at home or a sibling at home
um that's really
yeah if there were cars in here
um okay and then i think there's one more thing
does she ever pretend to feed the baby doll
no i haven't seen her put anything in any other things mouth
no no i'm sure that's coming but probably because she doesn't really take a bottle
right right
so and now she really wants to drink from a cup
a straw or a cup
she would prefer to have either of those
i'm getting teeth
yeah say the bottom ones and the top
almost in all the way
i'm like i'm getting teeth
almost almost
is there anything else
i think i've asked all the questions i have
anything else you wanna add or things i should um take note of
no i know they called and asked if she had um an ear infection
but she didn't and before we came the last time we had just come from the e n t wanted her to have her hearing tested
but she didn't see anything in there
okay
okay
and
do you have any concerns about her hearing
no it's just where she had the ear infections and the pediatrician sent her
but the e n t said there was nothing in her ears so i'm assuming if there's no fluid then
right
but she could probably hear a pin drop
and then that i mean she
her hearing is probably just fine
yeah she definitely if somebody is moving somewhere she's looking to see
what's that
alright that's all i have um are you
i can take the microphone now
which of the toys seemed to interest her the most
she definitely likes things like this
she can put in her mouth that make noise
like that's she really really likes those
yeah
so do you think those are good toys for her personality
yeah definitely
things that make noise
things that make noise
things that move
things that she can definitely explore with her mouth and her hands
have there been any changes since the last visit in terms of toys or games
um she loves these books like the peekaboo books
anything that she can lift up and see
like she loves those
as you can tell like most stuff goes into her mouth so
she likes these books more than like just the regular ones
but the ones that you know she still likes them
and she likes to turn the pages
but these guys are like a new favorite
so like before naptime we usually read some kind of book like this
so she really really likes those
and like the stuffed animals you know she kinda and dolls there's not a whole lot of interest in
she takes leaves you know
not as interested in those
okay
so which of the toys seemed to interest her the least
probably the stuffed animal ones
yeah
she was interested in the the doll though
like that's that's new
i mean we don't really have many dolls at home
we have more of like the animal ones
so this you know she was interested in
she probably i don't know if she thought it was a little person or
or not
we have no idea
maybe
yeah
let's see
do you remember what she played with at the last visit
she loved this thing
she liked the bee
and she played with a lot of like the food these things
i think at that point she was really kind of teething
and she might still she might be getting ready for some more teeth
so she played with the harder things a lot
and she played with some of the books
but again like this was the only kind of thing that interested her of all those
this yeah this stuff
interesting stuff on top
yeah
which books did she prefer to read or look at with you beside the ones that
i think the ones that have like either like the like the kinda like the touch and feel or the peekaboo ones versus the plain ones
because i mean she'll i mean she still is interested but not as interested in them
does she play with similar toys at home
yeah
i mean the these type of books
she has lots of kind of blocks at home that she loves playing with
i think these are kind of like the the blocks
um but yeah we don't have any any dolls though
that's the one thing we don't have at home that she seemed interested in
oh there you go lilly
you got it
you got it
so does she prefer books or toys in general
um it depends
i mean i think there's a time like if she if she can see the books then she'll wanna go after them
like if they're out
but if she's just around her toys then she's kind of happy
and if there's like both of them together
i don't know
i think like when she gets a little more kind of like tired like around naptime because of her routine then she kind of moves more toward books
she knows you know
but if she's awake like this and pretty active then she probably wants to play with toys yeah
yeah
do you think she
well she didn't really play with the food that much
do you think she recognizes any of them
she might recognize the peas
because she eats a lot of like
i think she was trying to like pull apart
because she can you know now now she can pick up like whole peas and actually eat them now
versus like the pureed stuff
but no
like the bread and the waffle i don't think she probably just thinks like a block
you know
yeah
are you trying to eat that
do you think there are any items that aren't here that she could recognize the names of
or any items that are here
um li if like the you know the the little rings on that little tri the stacking rings
i think she might
you know we call her rings or donuts
and i bet she would go after those
yeah
that's probably something she would recognize
yeah
are those yummy
okay that's it
that's it lilly
we're all done
yeah
certainly
so did you notice anything different from the last time
yes
last time he was not in
if if i'm remembering correctly
books were not so such a big deal to him then
and he was more interested in the stuffed animals and the food
but like one of the biggest differences i think is
this came off again
it's like his interest in more in processes now of turning pages of the book or
putting the cookies into something
and less he still examines everything but he wants to do something with it now
whereas before he just wanted to look at it and taste it
and now he's trying to do something with it
that was the biggest difference i saw
interesting
yeah
and he likes books
he sits and reads his brother's books
what would you say was his favorite thing today
this book
and the cookies
okay
the farm book and then putting the cookies in
alright you want this back
i know it's lunchtime
and like putting the cookies into something
so doing something
and um do you have that book at home
we don't have this book
we have uh we have lots of touch books where you feel
but we do not have that book no
okay
do they have animals in them too
yeah
do you think he's familiar with any of the animal names that were in there
i think so
we i think um ducks
we go and feed ducks all the time so
ducks and probably the cow
his brother l you know we look at cows a lot
in books
and sheep i guess
horse is the one that they're not as familiar with
um do you think that there is
i mean what was his the thing that he liked the least
he was not interested in the stuffed animals
not like last time
no you weren't interested in 
no
did you try to introduce some of them to him
yeah i tried to introduce the zebra
and he kinda touched it
and the frog
he wanted to poke its eye
but he didn't want go o he didn't once wanna go over and examine them so
and do you play with stuffed animals at home
yup
we have at home
but neither him nor his brother like to play them
they're there
they'll look at and hug and go away
they don't they don't play with them
um how the food
the food
he loved the food
he had fun he wanted to taste everything
which is lovely
i'm sure they're clean
but he wanted to taste everything
cookie
what were the ones that he
he wa he the cookies
the little m and cookies
and the uh spaghetti
he liked the the spaghetti
do you think he's familiar with those names
yes
yeah definitely cookie
and pizza
he knows
yeah that cookie's a hit
he's taking the cookie with him everywhere
i was surprised he wasn't as interested with the ah little sippy
but he
is he working with sippy now
he has he has cups yeah
he's a bad flirt
yes you are
you're a bad flirt
what about the baby doll
did you guys play with that
yeah we played with the baby doll
and only at the end he was willing to touch it
he just sat there and smiled at the baby doll
like curious but i don't know if he was a little intimidated by it
i mean he certainly wasn't afraid of the baby doll
but he didn't want to touch til the end
and then he finally kept touching its mouth
oh okay
but i had it touching his ha his arm
and he would just smile and look at the hand like
why are you touching me
is that do you have dolls at home that
we do not have any dolls
so this was kinda fun for him
yeah
new for him
yeah
um and then you said
yeah i pl i was having it sit next to him and touch his arm and
he would just stare at the arm and smile
i mean i'm pretty sure he thought it was definitely another baby
he just didn't know what to do with the other baby
smile at it
and i was surprised he didn't poke the other baby in the eye
you didn't poke the other baby in the eye
what's wrong
are you sitting on things
you sitting on a burger
sitting on a burger
don't get upset
do you have um pretend food at home
yes
you do
yeah
although we don't have pretend cookies or spaghetti or pizza so
and are you playing with the pre
is matthew also playing with you
yeah matthew plays with the pretend food
and he mostly
it has a grill
he goes over and hits the button and turns the grill on
that's what he likes to do
he's gonna be a grill man right
what else did um he play with
well now he's playing with the spoons
now he's playing with the spoon
i offered him the spoons he has spoons
and he normally likes 
and he looked at shook a few times and chucked 
okay
and is he using a spoon at home
yeah
and he tries to feed himself
it's a disaster but he tries
yes you try
he's been trying to feed himself since he was six months old
so
oh wow
he's a little independent guy
yes
both my children are very independent
um i think i got through all the questions here
is there anything else you thought was interesting in this play session
i g i think just the biggest things was the shift away from the stuffed animals and more into books
come on
can you navigate the pile of food to get to mommy
distracted by bread
i know you're ready for lunch
is it okay if i start asking you some questions
did you um notice anything different this time from since the last time
yeah last time she liked this thing a lot
um i think of the plastic nastiness on its head
and um i tried to like see if like she would remember it
and she really wanted to have nothing to do with that
she was really into the plates this time
like she kept going back for them no matter
if i gave her a toy or she picked up another toy she always went back to those
so and she's a lot more bouncy i guess this time
like she ah she's getting into it more i think
so you think the plates were the number one
yeah
favorite today
yeah
ah what were some other things that she thought were that she played with
um i th
don't don't eat that
um i think like the spoons and the keys too
i think it's the plastic sound
like the sound of plastic
um like she picked up the deer and a couple other things
but they were just quick like oh okay i'm done with that
so
so it's more noise than texture
yeah
yeah
what are some um things
do you play with these similar
is that what she's doing at home as well
yeah um we have like a set of those keys at home that she plays with
and she has a lot of sound toys
like she has a little keyboard
and um she has like a set of keys that have like an alarm button on 
um that makes noise
and ah she likes playing with the noise toys
more at home too
things that make noise
so
does she have um does she not play with stuffed animals at home
or does she have stuffed animals at home
she has 
she usually sleeps with them more than she um more than she plays with 
like she has a stuffed bunny that she can't go to sleep without
um like she has a couple things like during the day that i'll um like give to her
but she doesn't really doesn't really seem to play with them
she usually plays with books a lot when she's at home
and when i tried to give her the books here she wouldn't really
um we have good night moon
but it isn't the counting version
so um like when i flipped to this page she kind of like i kind of perked up
it's the same as the good night moon book
but i don't think we have any of these other books
how about foods
no we didn't
but we might have to
ah do you think she recognized the names of any of the items she played with today
um probably not
like we don't have any pretend food
and she's still eating just like oatmeal
and bottle so um
um but um i don't think we have any animals like these
like we have the typical bears and bunnies
so um she might have recognized book or baby
she didn't wanna have anything to do with the baby either
does she play with babies
um yeah she has um a baby doll that she plays with
and i only bring it out every once in a while it's like almost as big as her
it when i do she wants nothing to do with anything but that baby
so
tough work huh
do you do things with the does she usually play with the baby alone
what kinds of activities does she
she just yaps at it
and like um she'll give it like hugs and stuff
but she doesn't really um like associate anything with the baby just yet
um so
i mean she t she likes to toss it around too
unfortunately haha
do you pl at home do you play any added activities
like at this age i always give the example of pattycake
but of course that sounds funny
like you know like those types of activities where you just engage with not really any toys
um we haven't mastered pattycake
she does peekaboo
and um like for a few months it's been us going peekaboo
but just the other day she started to do it herself
like she pull up her blanket
and then when i say
where's masie
she'd pull it back down and start giggling
and um but she does that
she does so big sometimes
only when she really feels like it
haha but it's nice
actually quite normal
but those are th really the only two that i can think of
she likes to do that too
and like if we do it back
like make the same noise she made
she'll make it again
we do that too
yeah
she's well on her way
i'm gonna go ahead and ask you some questions now
okay
sounds like she was busy
she's a busy little girl
what did she like playing with this time
the stuffed animals and the food
did she do you think she had any favorites
um the sp i actually don't know where it got to
there it is
she loves spoons for some reason
she likes to hold them
yeah
but really i mean anything she can get her hands on
does she have stuffed animals at home
we have them but she doesn't usually play with them so much
so today she did
like them
yeah
i know you can't eat that either
which um of the animals did you show her
uh we did we pretty much did all of them
the kangaroo
their friend the d
the fox
the zebra
the otter i guess
it says seaweed so i'm assuming it's an otter
otter
the frog and i think the goose
she kinda went with the bee
and the chicken a little bit
oh and the donkey over here
yeah we we kinda hit everything
did she do anything with this
she just kinda
yeah
touched it
but
yeah
yeah
it is kinda gross
yeah
now that i look really closely at
yeah
it
it picks up everything unfortunately
i mean it's interesting hair but
yes
yes
not very clean hair
we tried to clean it many times
yeah
it just doesn't
uh yeah
yeah
it just makes it gummier
oh wow
like wetness makes it
i wonder if like wiping it down with like rubbing alcohol or something
that might clean it and stop the gumminess
good idea we'll try that
yeah
we've tried many things
but we haven't tried that that's a good idea
cause
how about the food items did she like any of those
yeah the pizza slices and now she's got the spaghetti
she's got a we've got a tea set at home and some like fruits and vegetables fake food and they she loves playing with them
okay
she tries to eat them too
yeah
so she's in the mood for spaghetti
yes
or pizza
yeah
and that's cool cause we're having spaghetti tonight
so it works out well if you can wait that long right
do you think she recognizes any of these items
i think the pizza she does
okay
yeah she loves pizza
my
husband does too
and does she eat uh peas
she we just started with peas and she likes them so i'm not quite sure if she recognizes them or she just though that's kinda funky looking
yeah
but
she's sorta putting them on the plate
she is
is that where food goes
and forks i mean spoons
she's trying to use spoon to dish this
yeah
h spoons too slow
and then did you guys look at any books
she did not no books today
yeah and i was surprised she didn't even look glance at the doll
cause she loves dolls but not today
she does o
loves dolls
so you must have those at home
we do
okay
we have many dolls that are supposed to be hers and that don't really get to be played with too much
but
okay
because big sister takes them but she loves them
and how is she with books at home
any interest
oh yeah she likes books
she uh likes to eat them
they taste good apparently
she'll kinda listen if i'm telling if i'm reading a story to my other daughter she'll kinda listen in
but she's really she don't she doesn't wanna sit down and listen yet
okay
but she likes to pretend she likes to take my books i'm a big reader and she likes to take my books and open them and look at the pages
yes
thank you
thank you
oh i didn't eat it fast enough uhoh
oh i am
i gonna get this one
giving it to the uh otter
thank you
so today you would say she did not she was not interested in the baby or the books um
yep
a little bit with the food
yeah
some what
yeah select items of the food
okay
and do you remember
when she was here for the first visit how she played or what she was interested in and um
um
whether it was different today
well she went for the food
and i think i kept throwing in the stuff
she liked this thing
okay
i remember that
but uh and the stuffed animals she was kinda like yeah their cool alright fine mom but
she was mostly she kinda just at first she kinda went
what do i do and
she played with the dolly
um that they had
okay so
where ya going
a little different today
yeah
because it's been a while that since
yeah
you were here right
so she's changed a lot
almost
almost four months
yeah
yeah
so
she's almost eleven months now
so august something
yeah
so um
so it seems like she may have changed a lot
oh yeah yeah
back then she used to just let jackie take her she just kinda sat there now she fights back and
alright
she's got toys she likes to play with
are there any toys that she plays with she really likes at home that we don't have here
she likes things that she can push like wheeled things that especially ones that are big enough that she can walk them
she's um
she's uh we went from taking a step to two steps to five steps in a matter of days
so she's really wanting to walk
and so things that we have a wagon at home that she likes to push
she like she loads it up with her dolls and any stuffed animals that are lying about
and then pushes it around the house so
okay
well she's
but
at that stage
wanting to do that
yeah so yeah
she was definitely up on her feet i saw that
oh yeah
yeah
she's definitely it's it's the second child syndrome
right
it's keeping up with the
yeah
big sister
better warn your daughter
oh yeah
she's already figured it out
she's like mommy then can come after me now
yeah i know
well i don't have anything else to ask
okay
unless you have anything to to add to it um we'll see you back very shortly
yeah
um she
may or may not change in
her interests
that's one of the things that's interesting
just to see if she plays differently or
right
if she's interested in something else
so we'll see but
okay
it will be the same set of things
okay
um and like i said
hopefully this time we'll make it through the
yeah
she'll make it through the
yeah
i will give you back this
keep going
okay good
haha
um have you um noticed any difference this time with the toys that he played with compared to last time
a broader interest um and a more diverse number of them
okay are there specific ones i see you know you played with the food is there a specific food item that he you know played with the most maybe
um he seemed to be excited about the ice cream cones um in the beginning and then they got his interest again so i would have to say that's probably the one that sticks in my mind
um pizza seems to interesting as well um of the food items i think that those would probably be his favorite if i was to label them uh and they're chewy
and the bottle but that's just reminding him that he's hungry and teething
it's time yeah
so it's hard to say if that's entertainment value or um a demonstration of hunger but anyway
do you think he recognized the names as you were playing with them of the items
spoon he knows um because we play with a lot of spoons and he likes spoons but the rest of them
plate maybe
um but i'm trying to think of anything else there's nothing else in here
but yeah just spoon and plate i think would be the limit of his understanding of utensils
okay haha um how about the activities that you do you have these this play uh this play food at home
no um but he goes for it he loves it every time he sees f play food i probably should get some we have a play kitchen and so he plays with cups and spoons and um a variety of kitchen implements pots pans but no no food
okay and um how about uh books in general
does he tend to like uh toys more or books more
he likes toys more
we do books and um sometimes he's in the mood for books but most frequently toys are more interesting
okay
but yeah
he'll he'll on a book while i read to him
haha
hi what do ya find
you found a good spoon it's got two spoons on it
it's amazing
it's the best spoon ever
and what about the activities that you're using the food for
are are there like certain games that you play
i i know you were doing the the knocking down and
that's a lot of fun
yeah um and uh let's see and bang the toy and um can we fit the toy in this is a lot of fun and uhoh where'd the toy go you know we put it in bins are you talking about just here or at home
both
okay
yeah
i i guess in here yeah the the hiding the treasures inside of things because it's fun to pull them out um i guess the picture was good for that
um and i recently actually discovered here the first time that he is interested in the faces of something that looks like a child
um and he's he's very interactive with other babies which is i dunno he and he has always been i just didn't put it together that he'd be interested in babies
so george here was helpful for that
and um we recently got a plastic baby that he does the same thing like kisses and chews on it's head haha but he'll kiss it's face and chew on the back of it's head
oh i don't know what that is but um that's part of his fun
um but not frequently it's just a random interest
oh
does he ever try to feed the doll at home or
no
do any activities that way or
no attempt to do any nurturing or parenting it's just mostly a i want to touch you and interact in some way with you but not in assistance no
okay
um and then i also noticed the you kept bringing up about the music like using the toys for
um he's very musical
he we usually have music playing and when he finds a song he likes as we're playing along he'll stop he'll listen he'll start to dance to it
um and so and he'll sing
and sometimes if there is no music on he'll start singing when he's playing with things and um he does this ah
haha but it's obvious that he's singing
um and so sometimes i can get him to do it when he's when he feels like it i guess
that's so cute
um okay so the question of the day what toy do you think interested him the most today
i'd have to say george again um just because he was so entertained by i think the uh if if we're talking about just an item food generally first as a whole but specific george i think george got a lot of love
william
hah where you going
come here
come here
come love on mommy and george
no you want to come love on mo he's like no i really don't
sure
he can he can keep playing
in terms of how he's playing and what he's playing with have there been any changes that you've noticed since the last time you were here
yeah
he's using objects more purposefully
you know like banging things together
yeah
and um
books
he'll get books and turn pages in books in board books and things like that
um so um
the baby
did he was he interested in it
yeah last time
yeah
and he um he has one at home
and he seems to like the babies
he'll gi he'll hug his baby at home and give it kisses
that's interesting
much to his daddy's dislike
daddy's get that way
yes they do
i think it's sweet
um okay so he's playing more purposefully
yeah
he likes books a little bit more
so he'll take them and turn pages and stuff
yeah the board books
um and he listens better to them
you can read um stories that he's familiar with
um he really likes books with um babies in them real pictures of babies in them
he'll watch those and even um
i think he's starting to anticipate
um there's one book in particular he likes where it says peeka and then you turn the page and boo
and he always seems to anticipate that
and he'll smile when he knows that part's coming up
so he's ba
is he familiar with any of the books that are here
no
no
nope
and do you think that um he prefers books or toys
um toys i think
okay
which of the toys do you think are most interesting to him at this age now
from here
yeah
um i think he's more interesting in this that he can hold in his hands and bang together
and then he seemed to like i think the texture here of of something like this
you gonna eat that
huh
how about in terms of home
what does he like the most of toys
um blocks and um cups
he likes cups a lot
um that but more if you build them up he'll knock them down
and he likes to bang together
he's not um you know putting things in them or or pouring things out of them
he likes things that he can shake too
rattles he tends to go to those
things that make noise too
yes you do like that
um which of the toys here do you think interested him the least
the animals
animals
yeah the stuffed animals
does he have any of those at home
he has a few but not very many so
and how does he
he doesn't usually pay much attention
when they're new when they first come out he will
and then they tend to be put away
he doesn't or he leaves them in the in his basket
he doesn't pull them out
okay
he te he'll pull them out
he doesn't play with them i guess i should say
he likes to take things out
and he just sort of tosses it aside
you get the feeling it could be anything
yes
let's see
so do you think his interest in type of toy has changed since the last time
um yeah
i think
well
no he seems to be playing with the same toys just in a more purposeful way
great
um you said he has a baby at home and plays with it
he turns pages of the board book
and does he have kitchen and food items like that at home like we have here
no
he doesn't have those
and you know i i don't know so much that it's board books that he's able to manipulate
it's more the bath books
those are the ones that i see him kinda turning um more so um now that i think about it
okay they're the ones you mean
yeah
the plasticy ones
yeah
the the ones that can go right in
he these are i think harder for him
he'll if he's sitting on your lap he'll try to turn it
but it's usually many pages at once that get turned
you want that
what does when he plays with the baby what does he like to do
he'll hold it up
and um a lot of times he'll uh put the feet or the hands in his mouth
he'll babble to it
um he'll give it um sometimes if you tell him give the baby a hug he'll you know bring it to him
um he puts his mouth on the head
which we say he's kissing it but i don't know that that he is
right
um
what
can't get up
push
that's interesting because a lot of the kids at this age don't like the baby
oh really
so that's interesting yeah
um okay does he so he doesn't sound like he is feeding the baby or
no he doesn't do things like that
um and then i think the last thing is at this point do you think he recognizes the names of any of the items here or beginning to recognize any names
the the objects that are here
um no
probably not
maybe the baby a little bit because
yeah
um more so at home though i think if you say that he does know which is his baby
the toys that he has at home
yeah
a ba the baby's probably the only one that he really um sort of knows and not not consistently i wouldn't say
okay
i think that's about it
is there anything that i didn't ask you that you think would be helpful to know about how he plays or what he plays with at this stage
no
no this is pre
he's happy playing um by himself
he is
he's pretty good about that
and he's um he um i i noticed he doesn't he's quiet a lot of times when he's playing
um whereas if he's in the car he makes he seems to make more noises and more babbling
yeah
but he seems quiet when he gets new toys and things like that very focused on them and
and he can he can sit for entertain himself it seems like
that's great
big boy
okay well that's all i had to ask you
i'm gonna ask the questions
okay
that's okay
alright
where you goin parker
he's like i don't know you
okay um which set of toys do you think he was most interested in
i would say the babydoll
the doll
yep
okay
um do you have dolls at home
no
we don't
okay um what about which set was he least interested in
um least i guess i'd say the books
okay
um do you why do you think he was least wasn't interested in them
i guess he was more interested in the baby
we read books at home and he's always excited to read the books
i mean he wants to close them whileeve whenever i'm reading them but he's excited about the books for the most part
okay
do you have any of these at home
um we have that one
okay
this isn't one of his favorites
um no just this one so far
um do you think his interests have changed since the last visit
i don't know if you can remember
yes
yes a lot
the last time he wanted to just chew on everything now he just wanted to throw everything
oh yeah
um do you think he would recognize the names of any of the toys we have here
maybe the foods or
or the animals
not necessarily
um maybe the dog
okay
maybe
the books he he recognizes the word book
okay
um but i haven't really given him food in food form
okay
like it's more pureed so
yeah
plus it's not been any of those those foods at all
um do you have a pretend food set at home
no we don't have that either no
so would you say he likes toys or books
at this stage
toys
toys
yeah
um so which toy would you say is the best for his personality
i'd say the baby
yeah
i might have to get you a babydoll
we have to get you a baby
um i'm just trying to go over questions i have
okay
i think that should be it unless is there anything you want to tell us about how he plays at home
anything you could think of
um he usually goes after the electronics
we have tons of different toys for him but the ones he picks are my cellphone or the remote or the telephone
right
those toys are the ones that catches his attention the most
we gave him a keyboard of a computer just for him
but he still tries to get ours instead
oh
so
okay
just electronics are his favorites
okay
oh i think there's one more
do you remember which food toys he played with specifically
uh well the burger now
okay
um the bean the peas he picked up
but pretty much anything i handed him he tossed
oh
the maybe the bottle and the cup he liked a little more
okay
the cup he tried to drink out of
he was scared of this last time and he's picking it up himself so
oh really
yeah it's kinda weird looking
yeah i don't know if he's he kinda like made a face but he still picked it up so that's good
it looks i dunno it's funny looking
it's that hair that wiggly hair that scares him
yeah
okay i think that is it
alright
sure
yes
um which group of toys did she seem most interested in
um probably this one
um why do you think that is
um well i tried to engage with a few of these and she kind of touched but she kept these things in her hands
the whole time
yeah stuffed animal are probably what she wanted
and she has about a five second maybe two second attention span so books are quite one thing at a time
alright so so what was she most interested in or most interested in the books or the animals would you say
between those two
maybe the animals
animals
uh okay um do you think she would recognize any of the animals we have or the names of them
the dog or
i don't think so
okay
um do you guys have any play toys at home or play sets
i do have some
so what about the foods would she recognize any of those
um i don't think so
she doesn't eat well even the things we have are like large peaches and onions and things like that so i don't think um stuff like this
okay um we noticed a lot of the babies like to play with the spoons is she is she into those
yes
and she plays with dolls
absolutely yes
well do you have any of the books we have at home
um
i do
i have these two
oh i have this one too yup these three
okay uhhum
what about the doll does she like the doll at all
yeah she seemed to
and the only doll that we have at home so far is a stuffed animal doll and she hasn't showed a lot of interest so it was interesting to see her responding to the hard eyes and everything every time i put it down she seemed to want it back
okay um which one would you say is the best one for her personality
that is hard to say
um
one particular toy
or like the group of toys okay
well she's i would say probably the plates and spoons
um she's very interactive and likes things that make noise so just the sound of them and uh
i think she's getting the concept of it so i would say probably those right now
okay i think that's it is there anything else um what she plays with at home favorite toys or anything
um
hard to keep the two of them straight
sala what do you play with at home
just baby interactive toys i mean she always goes for those
she'll she messing she branching out messing with the other things but just little baby interactive one that spins around
she likes things that make noise
so
okay i think we are all done
i'm ready to just ask you a some few questions
okay
uh she can just play with what she wants
hi there
okay so first of all do you notice any difference between what she liked this time and last time
i don't think i remember
i vaguely remember her chewing on this but
otherwise no she mostly likes these
so you would say she um liked those the best today
okay
and do you think there's any particular reason why she likes those
she can chew on them
and they make more noise when she's banging them together
so those were her favorites
how about
what did you see
the like
oh she didn't touch any of the stuffed animals
so
although that was the first thing she was going towards before everything got before we started
there's no further interest in
no
and how about the baby doll is she interested in that at all
she's interested in the mic though
no no baby
i think she liked the the eyes opening and closing
and she likes pulling on her eyes so i she liked the doll's ears too
how about the book
is there any interest
no
i mean they caught her eye for a second but
so she really stuck with the okay
was she
you may not play with the microphone
looking
did she recognize the names of any of those
either the food items or the um implements
maybe spoon
but otherwise most of this is stuff she can't eat yet
oh okay
at least not in that format
she can have peas but that's about it
no ice cream yet
no ice cream
no no cookies for you
no
no cookies
you just need a to be a little older
um okay so you think probably last time that she liked those same things
do you notice any difference
in the way she's playing with things
um between last time and now or lets say in the last two months
yeah
yeah
what is it
do you have spoons
yeah
how it goes
does she play with the new at home
uh
no we don't have a set of those
she plays with but she likes anything that makes noise and that she can chew on
oh where you going squirmy
um
oh does she have any toy at home that she's attached to that we don't have here
no not really she used to have a favorite little toy but she doesn't seem to care too much about it anymore
now it's just whatever's around
whatever's there
she likes chewing on paper
she also has a brother to play with
yes
okay let's see
does she have any baby dolls at home
no not really
okay
okay
she might see them at church but
is she is she go to childcare the church
yeah
that might be her only time though
yeah
let's see um she probably haven't started her on clocks yet
no not yet
where ya going scrolly
but she kinda liked it didn't she
yeah well she liked the the soft and she could sink her teeth into it
so that's how you like to play
yeah
so you'd say she probably likes books if she if they're good to chew
yeah
yep
kay
well um unless you think there's something that we should know about what she likes or how she likes to play then um i think that's all the questions i have
she mostly just likes running around a chewing on stuff
cause she's a pretty active kid
yeah
so would you say that has something to do with what she plays with
yeah i i used to imagine that my kids would like to sit down and read books but
not quite yet
my son's getting there
but mostly they just want to chew on them
and other things
ha ha
you're silly
you're so active and curious
yeah yes yeah
alright well then i can turn these things off and take the microphone away
new toys
just a few questions
okay
was there a group of toys that he was most interested in
uh i think maybe like the pretend food
he he just liked putting it in his mouth
um do you guys have pretend food at home
his older sister does
so she has a lot of these same foods
so they play with it all the time
and i think because it's hard and he's teething so he kind of likes to bite on it too
um do you think he would recognize the names of any of these the foods
um well he seemed to remember spaghetti
he was playing with it
and he threw it
and i asked him for it
and then he gave it back to me
i didn't even point
and he kinda knew
um but otherwise he's not really eating these foods yet
okay
um was there a group of toys that he wasn't interested in at all
um the book
he didn't really seem too interested in that
i was reading it to him
he was just playing with something else
leave that alone
do you have any of these books at home
we do
we have uh mister brown can moo
and the good night book
change at all
um i think he was playing i think he was a little more interested in the books then he could just sit there and i'll read to him
whereas now he's more mobile
he's just he'll just if he's not interested he'll just go to the next thing
maybe it has to do that he has to do with he's more mobile now
so would you say he's more interested in books or toys
toys
how about the stuffed animals
did he like those at all
yes he did
he gave the kangaroo a kiss
and he was laughing when the donkey was jumping on his head
and tickling his feet
um do remember which toys specifically he played with
um he played with the ice cone
he um keys
and the cup
here this one
he was drinking from that
and the spaghetti
there he goes again
that's just a pretend cup
uh let's see
do you have dolls at home
yes we have dolls
do you pretend to feed the doll or anything
um his sister i think he watches her a lot
and when she doesn't have the doll in her hand he grabs it
to play or hold it
maybe just to take it away she has it
but yeah he they have dolls at home
all right um i think that's it
is there anything else you can think of about how he plays at home that you want to tell or
he likes stuff he can stand with like taller toys or you know bigger toys that he can stand on he he likes to stand now
he doesn't really sit still for very long
which is part of the reason why books might not be his thing right now
he just wants to crawl and walk and
that's pretty much it
okay i think we are done
all done
let's put that toy back
yeah that was the only thing she wanted to play with last time
yep yep
last time she just shook those the whole time
that was gonna be my next question is what she played with last time
yep
so did she what was she interested in
yes i see
what was she interested in this time
well the first thing she went for is is the books and that she's really into books right now
she likes to open them and close them and pretend to read them
when we're at home we'll put books on the floor and she loves to just open and close the pages
and um then she went after all the play food after that
she seems interested in in mostly the ones with different colors on them
so she liked the cookie
the cookies and the pizza and then some of these um blocks with like the different
she was banging these together for a little bit
oh did mommy distract you
does she like to do that at home make noise
yes she likes to bang blocks and things together or or shake things
we actually bought her at the dollar store some spoons that she plays with now
cause she liked to play with these so much
she has her own measuring spoons now
she's showing the camera she's very happy
is that funny
that's that's her very excited face
she seems very proud to have those
going back to the books um did she like any book in particular
she picked up this one a couple of times
and then these three right here are the ones she picked up
does she have anything like that at home
we have good night moon at home
um and we also have a bunch of little doctor seuss books but not these ones
and she we read them at home
when we have story time she'll sit on my lap and we'll read them
and do you think she would do you think she picked those because they seem familiar in any kind of way
well i have noticed at home if we lay out a bunch of books she likes to pick the same two or three over and over or so
it is possible that they're familiar
especially this one
we ha we don't have this but we have the regular good night moon where the pictures are similar
yeah she's definitely starting to recognize things
well mommy was touching it so now she's got to come over here
so she does have some favorites or at least those she's more interested in
more interested in
if you lay it cause i'll i'll let her pick
so i'll lay like four or five on the floor and let her pick which one we're gonna read whichever one she picks up first
so
she does seem interested
so she likes books
she certainly likes the measuring spoons
and you said she liked um the play foods that had a lot of colors in them
that's what it seemed like to me like if i gave her like this she'd hold it for a second and then she's just done with it
but anything that had multiple colors on it seems to be more interesting to her right now
would she recognize any of these like a lot of babies have peas
well i mean her peas don't look like that
you know she's kinda eating baby food peas
um you know she didn't try to put anything in her mouth so she doesn't recognize it as food yet
i know when they're a little older they'll put play food in their mouth
yeah she doesn't none of this would be stuff that she would get to eat
um or or necessarily see in this form like her peas would be all ground up still
okay
she doesn't eat bread or
she doesn't eat bread she doesn't eat pizza
she doesn't eat ice cream
um okay how about the bottle or sippy cup was she interested in those
no but she doesn't dr have bottles either
yeah she's
you like that clock
its got a face
yeah it definitely has colors and an interesting face
but its got an interesting material
yeah
was she interested in any of the stuffed animals today
not really i showed her a few
but she didn't really seem into 
she looked at the baby for a second
okay
but that you know as she was making her way through
she's not really into the stuffed animals yet
when we have at home she mostly just picks up and throws them out of the way as she's going for something else
yeah
so you showed her something and
no
she smiled at it but she didn't stop what she was doing to go play with it
let's see if there's anything else
see the piggy
oh this one has a feel
you feel that
like what we have at home we have the feely books at home
oh so does she like those books at home
yeah
and you probably don't have any play food or at home
no she has a little teaset that she got for christmas
but she's not so much interested in the dishes
she likes the um the teapot when you tip it over it like makes noise plays music
that's what she plays with
but she's not so much into the dishes yet
she really likes
she does
she loves books she loves to turn pages
well thank you so much
um do you think what do you think uh vincent liked the most here today
um
probably the baby dolls
and
and the books seemed to light up his books seemed to light up his face the most
and the and when i rolled the thing um
the baby dolls his sister has a bunch of baby dolls where he's always trying to get at them
and she's like
no those are my toys
and then she you know moves them away so i think he was very excited to get his hands one finally
um
aw
we we roll a lot of balls back and forth
um
and he loves to um he loves to be able to turn a page and gets very excited about seeing a new
a new page once he makes this movement
uh and y it's like like a miracle look it's a whole different picture
um
and then um
i i guess new toys we don't have food toys at home accessible to him yet
they're downstairs
and
so we're not downstairs in in sort of basement as much as you know we have a finished basement
um
they're also some kind of smaller so
they're little chokeable pieces to them and stuff because they're you know a six year old style of food pieces so
um
do you read books at home
we read books at home
um
he looks through books a lot he's um
he'll he'll be with you know we'll have these type of board books um that he will just initiate turning the pages you know by himself um
whether i'm facilitating or not
um
and he likes to throw things
do you have any of the same books
um
gosh
um
no not the not the same exact books
okay uh how about uh the food do you think there's anything here that uh he already he knows the that he recognizes the name of
uh
i don't think so
um
i haven't i haven't
well i haven't told him any names of food i don't know who else is talking to him so
maybe he does but
um
yeah he's still on like formula
he's still on formula with a with some mush
you know and he just started with some crackers
so i told him cra you know he he knows the word cra not knows it but i mean i've
um
told him the word crackers when i hand it to him
i don't know if he knows it or not
and then bottle
and
i don't know if i do anything for the i don't think i do anything for the cereal
um
i say more to him a lot like if he wants some more something
i'll say i'll say more
um
i think all other food items i haven't named yet
he scoots
he scoots his sister scooted too which is funny they're not
they're not uh biologically related
i got the two scooters in the world
yes
yes i did
yes i very wet kiss
you should you should give me a towel afterwards
yeah
uh do you guys play with stuffed animals at home
um i don't play with him with stuffed animals his sister plays with stuffed animals a lot with him and makes them talk and makes them
you know
bounce around
um
he doesn't i haven't see him
go for a stuffed animal and play with it intently on his own
like i do w you know with a ball and a book and this
things that can fall apart he really likes um
he's we've got this sort of wooden magnetic ball
it's got little wooden parts that that that attach together by magnets to form a sphere
and
it was his sister's and both of them roll it
both of them like rolling it
and taking it apart
only his sister would take it apart with her hands
and he picks it up and he drops it
and so all the the pieces go like that
oh wow
so they both like to take things apart but it's like wow
different techniques for getting them there
um so he he likes movement a lot in toys
do you remember what he played what he was most interested in last time
oh gosh
i can't remember but i remember we didn't play with the stuffed animals at all
um i don't think we played with the food at all
so what was there left books and spoons
he likes spoons a lot
i don't know if there was a ball there last time or if he was even
aware of balls
well what would you say today was like his least favorite thing
did you try to get him to play with something and he just wasn't having it
um
what did i
um
maybe the stuffed animal actually
i mean he kind of looked at if for a while
and then turned away
and now you're gonna disprove me but that's okay
it was you know i tried
i didn't do that but
it's okay
but everything else he picked up with he seemed to stay with for a while or do something to you know
um not just kind of look at it and toss it down really
and would you say this is how you play at home usually
yeah
yeah
i'll spend i'll spend some time with him on the floor um
um
sometimes we'll you know hide the toys i don't think i did it this time like this and make it go away and then
um
have it appear again
um
sometimes
ow ow
sometimes he'll try to put the toy in my mouth after he takes it
yes
yes and then sometimes we just play with each other
like this
and crawl all over the place
and do little dippy dips
and do little head bellies
you know you know
sometimes we do that
yes
of course
so what do think um she liked the most here today
um
i mean when she came she played pretty much on this side of the with the toys
so just the stuffed animals and then the
yeah i mean she's got prob when she walked in the stuffed animals are the first thing she walked over to
she liked the doll but i think that the doll is too big for her
she tried to pick it up but i think it's a little too too awkward
she has a small babydoll
what um does she play with stuffed animals at home
she has um she has stuffed animals at home that she'll pull out
out of i mean in terms of how much playing she has um
they're not the little people they're called animalville
it's the same thing but they're little animal characters
so she has that but she'll you know walk around it and stuff and then she has um between uh a regular babydoll and then she has one that crawls
that'll she'll pretty much entertain herself with but she's back and forth and back and i mean she'll walk into her room pull out a toy walk over play with the toy a little bit walk back to her room
so nothing keeps her interest for very long
i mean she definitely likes her dolls
i noticed that she'll go and get her dolls
you think she recognized the names of any of the animals that you played with today
um
maybe dog cause we have you know we have the dogs at home
so definitely the dog
i say that i don't think you have any cat
i mean dog and cat i think are the two that are the most common to her cause that's what we have at the house
um how about the foods that you may have played with today were there any that she was familiar with or that she really liked or maybe wasn't familiar with
she tried to drink out of the sippy
which is what she is drinking out of now
i gave her the bottle but she didn't have much interest in it and it's been a while a little while since she's actually had a bottle so i don't know if she's just been
lost interest in it but otherwise
not really
and what about the books do you have any of the same books at home
she has um not the same but she has a bunch of like the small um picture books and like the hard books i don't she has like a bin of books that she can dig into and sometimes i'll put her in her crib with just a bunch of books and she'll just flip through them for a little while
so
so usually the books are for like bedtime or like relaxing
sometimes yeah just for relaxing
and then you know um if i wanna try and get a couple of things done or go take a shower i'll put her in the crib with them so that it'll entertain her for a while
i know the baby is so big
do you think that the book that you went through she may have recognized or was familiar with some of things that were in that book
i don't know how familiar she is with a lot of you know like because she's not saying anything yet um
so i'm not sure she's familiar with it yet
okay
i don't think so
okay uh were there any differences between this visit and the last visit as far as what toys she liked
she actually sat with me for a book this time which last time i don't i think i tried and she wasn't really having it
was she walking last time
no well how long ago was last time
uh end of july
july thirtieth
not yet
she starting walking at nine at nine months
okay
a little before nine months
so last time she wasn't into the books what about this time was she not into something
uh
she i mean she would start here and she went through some of the stuffed animals and threw out the ones that she had no interest in
i mean it was between the fox and the little zebra i noticed that she picked up and carried around and i can't think of anything at home that looks like the two of them
she's cute
thank you
uh and do you remember what she liked the most last time
i think last time she played a lot with the food
i think she sorted through the food a lot
so this time she's more into like the animals and dolls if you could be
yeah
what is that
do you think she is into colors noise or sound
she loves music
she's got a couple of toys at home that you press the buttons and it will play music for her and shh same thing with com like if she's walking by and there's a commercial or a tv show at the end of a show you know sometimes they'll have music at the end of a show she'll stop to dance
she's into them that's good
yeah
yes
okay is she into um is she into any foods now or is she still on like cereal and formula
she eats whatever pretty much whatever we have as long as it's not too spicy or we don't give her meat
we're trying not to give her not trying trying really hard not to give her meat
okay
um but so she eats i mean she'll eat whatever we're eating
she still has a sippy and i'll put cereal in the sippy but um
lots of fruit
right lots of fruit
so probably like you know the ice cream cone
is probably not too familiar
no
like i mean she'll like the little animal cracker or i was gonna say like even the cookies here she doesn't eat any of these kinds of cookies
i guess the sippy she picked up and tried to drink out of
so that i think she recognized as
okay i think that that's it for the for the questions
okay
i just wanted to get a feel for what was going on in the play session
come here buddy
did you notice any changes since his last visit in what he was playing with
um i think last time he was interested in the plastic things
this time he was interested in the pl just biting on all the plastic things
um it seemed like he paid attention a little bit more to the books
when i read
and he wasn't interested in any of the stuffed animals again
um last time he was trying to grab the cords and everything and pretty much the same thing this time
okay um do you have any of the books at home
i think we asked the last time
i don't think we have something we have good night moon
um and we have s uh something similar by the same author
okay but not peekababy
i don't think it's peekababy
but it's something similar it's peek a and you flip the flip the different things
see the fuzzies
did he play with any specific toys
the main thing i think were the pizza and the hamburger
plastic hamburger and the pizza and the waffle
okay um do you think he'd recognize any
probably i guess
um i mean he doesn't eat that food but he's seen us eat the food
um at home he likes to play with his sister's um plastic food and stuff
okay what about is there a bottle here
yeah he played with he picked it up a couple times
but i'm surprised he didn't try to drink it
do you know that's not real
ah there we go
he recognizes
okay um well why do you think he wasn't interested in the um the stuffed animals
i don't know
i think he likes putting everything in his mouth and maybe the the plastic things
the plastic things might be what he prefers in his mouth right now
i don't know
um and i think were you saying you have some of these or his sister
his sister has i mean none of these exactly
um but she has like plates but they're pink and purple
um she doesn't have pizza or waffles or hamburgers
or it's all like uh fruit and vegetables i think and a pancake
i don't see any any exact one's that she has
what about the doll
did he like that at all
he like i think ignored the doll
did he do that last time or do you remember
i don't remember
he may have went up to it
if anything
but i don't remember him any significant amount of time with the doll
okay well he's friendly
um okay i think we're all done
unless are there any um toys he plays with at home
other toys or anything
he likes anything you put into his mouth
um he really likes this ball machine that shoots up balls
and anything that makes any noise
like he has like a little ride on toy that has a piano on it and like a horn and all kinds of things you can push
so he'll sit there and play and bang
and he has a drum he likes
when he hits it it lights up and stuff
so i think he likes the ones that he gets something out of it too
okay
alright i think that is it
i just have a couple of questions for you
okay
um
okay
so which toys do you think she was the most interested in
these three
the um keys the bee and the baby
okay was that the same as last time
um the bee is definitely the same
i don't remember anything else last time
okay
now which toys do you think she was least interested in
um surprisingly the books
she loves books
so do you tend to read more books at home
yeah and she eats them
it's her favorite past time
do you have any of the books that we have here
um
i don't think so
nope
similar ones but nothing that's exactly the same
okay
um do you think that there are items here that she would recognize the names of
the baby and some of the food items
does she eat any of the food items
uh waffles
bread
not much of it
okay
do you have um food items at home like these
yep
okay
um
so does she play with dolls at home
um
she they're there she doesn't usually play with them
does she ever try to feed them or
no
no
um
she tries to tackle them
okay
um
was there a book here you think that she liked the most
no
no
okay
um is there anything you'd like to tell us about her play skills something that she might do at home that she hasn't done here
um
everything goes in the mouth
nothing really different
she is more mobile at home
she doesn't really sit in one spot like this
but this is there we go
now she's being herself
okay great
alright so we're all done here then let me just shut off this stuff
can i ask you some questions
yeah
yes
uh what do you think that she liked playing with the most today
um probably the doll again
well she kept going to the doll but then she liked the food too
i think yeah
okay
do you have dolls at home
um it's funny cause after we came the last time and i realized she was into it we did get a few dolls
and she has been she's been very into dolls and um we have a few books of like baby faces and stuff like that
and checking out her babies um she has we have a few friends that have babies but
checking out their faces and their features and stuff so
that's really sweet
does she um how does she play with the dolls at home
um she eats them sometimes
and then but she'll also sometimes she'll pat and sometimes we put to bed
and um sometimes she'll feed them
but more a lot of times when she's playing with it her brother's also there so he'll help take care of the doll or whatever so she'll watch but
yeah
do you have uh play food at home
we do have play food at home
yes
is that what she uses to feed
um yes she will um she and her brother also play store
so um he will
he'll be like i'd like a or i'd like spaghetti
we do have spaghetti at home
and so he'll then he'll give it to her and
aw
so it's cute
that's sweet
yeah
he's a good big brother
d you think there are any foods here that she's now um that are familiar to her either by look or name
um
well the cookie maybe she doesn't really eat cookies but her brother does once in a while so she may see that or or she might know it as a cracker cause she eats crackers
um
i dunno what else
peas she might know
sometimes she'll make a face if we say peas
you have to pizza you know a little you may know a little
pizza
d you know the pizza cause dad william has pizza at home
plays pizza
is she still drinking uh milk juice or anything out of the bottle
um
she doesn't drink out of a bottle but she drinks water out of a sippy cup
oh okay
yeah so
she never took to the bottle unfortunately so
oh
so we went right to the sippy cup right yeah
that's good
yeah
um do you read books at home
we do read books at home
we read a lot with her with her brother
and then um right before she goes to bed we read one book so
okay
are some are any of them on animals or what you read today
um
like
we do have we do have uh a farm book that's sort of similar to this yes
okay
um
and actually she has another book that we read that has um like a pink has a pink poodle sort of like this in it
and um i'm tryin think what else do we read
we have baby faces that she likes too
it has the baby doing different things
like angry baby or happy baby or dirty baby
clean baby
right
yup
oh and she knows measuring spoons cause we have a whole cupboard of all of our baking stuff i just let them play with them and then when i use it i'll just clean it but
so
that's a clock lets not eat the clock
so she's into spoons
yes
she likes to try to feed herself
even though she can't
and with the animals are you working on like animal sounds with him her or william
um
well william knows his and we sing um little william had a farm
oh
and so cause she also well we have like the little uh people farm
and so he'll bring out the piece pieces
and he'll he he actually does the sounds for her so
she knows um she will do once in a while a lion
cause his favorite he has a little lion that he loves and he he growls or does the roar and she'll she'll do that sometimes too but
aw
right
cause i thought it sounded like she was kind of mimicking some of the sounds you were making so i thought maybe she knew
she doesn't really do that like she'll she'll sometimes try you you know try to but
um but no she like they do like playing farm
we have lots of farm stuff
yeah
what do you think was her least favorite uh toy or unliked toy
um
i don't know
you seem to like everything huh
huh
was there anything that you presented to her that she really didn't
she would didn't
um
trying to think
she played a little with the frog i guess
the chicken
um
the book
she'll usually sit for more more like if we're reading she'll sit i'll be able to read the whole thing and she'll sit and sort of look or whatever but
today she seemed to be more into the food and the probably
yeah
and the and the other things
well she certainly enjoyed chewing
yeah oh okay sorry no
again it's okay no she's being so nice while we talk
just very calm
oh she looks like she's lunging to me hello
very cute
yeah
is she eating any solid oh you said she is eating peas
well she's eating um the peas in the i mean ground peas but yes
right
and she eats um she eats she eats pretty much any food ground up
and then um she eats little pieces we'll do very soft um either sweet potato
or avocado
right
because we only have the two bottom teeth so chewing chewing's kinda hard
oh that's
but um she eats crackers
and she eats puffs and cheerios
what else d you eat
you gnaw on bread sometimes
and muffins
she likes muffins
oh
so a lot of bready products
yeah
soft cause they're soft yeah
they're soft right yeah
okay
we tried green beans but they weren't soft enough
so we have to wait yeah
she's havin fun
she she does um apples sometimes too
like we'll peel it just like little pieces and she'll just keep chomping it until it
right oh a key fell out
should we put it back
we put it back
it's a purple key
right in the mouth
i know
no supposed to put it back i know
put it back in my mouth
exactly
alright well i think that's all have for today
okay alright
um do you have your next appointment scheduled already
no
oops
excuse you
you're very smart
yeah you're like this is over
she's like i'm done
so done
wow
um so i think i heard you say so they don't eat ice or anything
right
they eat yogurt
but
but no it's kinda funny the food that you have here is not
they eat food but not this food so
yeah i get that a lot
a lot of times people i ask people um they se tend to play with the peas
and i say oh you know are they eating that and they're like i mean they it doesn't look like that
right
you know when it comes in the ja in the jar and i'm always just asking like whether they recognize the name
right
you know
right
and stuff 
and i dunno i mean we we have peas and i everytime i give them peas i say peas but do i if i said chicken and gave them peas would they look at me funny i don't think so
i don't think they have that recognition yet
right
that's a good point
that's a good point
they've certainly heard the word though
and then you play peekaboo with her too and
and things like that
i know on the questionnaires it talks about patty cake we're not doing patty cake yet but
not there yet
but we do lots of peekaboo and we do lots of hiding and you know hiding around corners and things like that
okay
alright
do you think oh um one question i didn't even ask last time or with allison was um what do you think is attracting them most to these toys like whether it's texture or um noise or
i think it's a combination of things
i definitely think it's material with the plastic stuff
this feels like the things at home that they chew on
and so i think they they feel it and they put it in their mouth and they're teething so that feels good to them
so i with the plastic stuff i think that's what's going on
um maybe a little bit of color because they definitely she definitely gravitated toward the bright blue plate and the pizza more than some of the duller things
um with the doll i think it's that it's new
she's never seen something that looks like this except her live twin
and so at fi like i was really wondering if she thought that this were a real person for a few minutes there
and that you know she started like sucking on it and like kissing it and moving it over and it didn't respond too much so in the end i think she figured out that it wasn't real but
at the beginning i'm not sure quite what she thought about that
um so i think she was attracted to it it's it's new and
it's interesting
and potentially interactive the way her twin is
that's great
oh yeah she's all over everything
yeah that's the way at home she's keeps me on my toes
alright well i think um that's it
alright
sure
okay i didn't run the play session last time so can you tell me which toys she was most interested in last time as well
by far this one
okay
the bumblebee
something about the hair
she had a literally she had it in her mouth the whole time
and were there any toys that she didn't seem to pay any attention to this time
i don't think the doll was here last time
um but yeah li yeah last time she didn't
i figured she's pick up on this one the black and white
she didn't pay any attention to that
she didn't this time either
oh i should've done the puppet
she likes puppets
what about today
which toys did she seem the most interested today
um definitely the peas
um and i think the doll
i don't she's never really seen a doll
you know a doll baby like this
um i think that definitely caught her attention
you tryin to feed the peas to her
i don't think she knew what to make of it
and which would you say she was the least interested in which toys
probably the stuffed animals
most of the stuffed animals yeah
do you think she recognizes the names for any of these items
maybe book but yeah that would be probably it
what about any of the food items
most of her food is still uh pureed
so i mean i don't know that shh i mean she might recognize the word peas
but i don't know if she would actually associate with that shape
you know what i mean the shape of the food
um other than that probably probably not maybe ice cream
i don't know
do you have any of these exact same toys at home
um we had this book
okay
oh and good night moon
but uh this is one two three a counting book so its i don't think this it's the same book
it's not the same book yeah
and would you say she prefers like at home books over toys or toys over books
she's really yeah she she really likes her books which is something relatively new
um but she also has um like a tambourine and some maracas that she really likes so
i'd say those two are stiff competition between the two
it would be hardpressed for me to say which one she favors more
okay um now the animals do you think she
some kids have very early on teach them about animals and seem to recognize some of these animals
she doesn't watch tv
um i doubt she recognizes any of these
i tr we don't even really she has some stuffed animals but she doesn't really play with them
um the next visit will probably be in a month
okay
um we'll give you a call
oh she's discovered a
you remember that
that's a completely new material for you
i just don't think she's
oh right you know okay maybe we shouldn't do that
now that you have teeth that's probably not a good idea
probably not stellar
okay so in a month
oh no no problem
yeah that would be a good idea
while he's playing lets
you're doing a good job
he's happy
he is
what did you just say he was doing
he's putting the
yeah
he's putting all the toys behind him
does he like to do that
um
there normally aren't this many toys at once
so he likes to drop them on the other side of gates and behind furniture and things
oh boy
let's not play with the power cords
i'll be the blocker
i forgot i was connected to the cord
surprised he hasn't found that yet
so did you notice any differences between what he wanted to do today compared to last time he was here
um
if i remember last time
that's the question
last time he was very interested in these waffles
okay
he was chewing on it a lot
guess he's been more interested in moving the toys around this time
from one place to another
throwing them around
did he um play with any particular item the most
you've got something there
he played a lot with the plastic toys but i don't know if that's because he liked them best or because they're in the middle and that's where he was put down
that's where he was put down
but he does typically like things that are harder that he can gnaw on
okay
and
yeah it looks like he can pick up some of them too
right
yeah
would he know any of these items from just at home when he
um
he maybe eats some of the stuff whether he would recognize that it's the same thing i don't know
what does he eat
that we have here
peas
there's bread but i mean it would be in pieces he wouldn't have a whole piece of bread
not the wire
pieces of little pieces of pizza but again it would be in baby size bits
i guess everything would be
little pieces of cheese
okay
he's got a cookie
yeah i mean he's had like just like little teeny tiny pieces of cookie
but he's never been like given a whole cookie
never a whole cookie
poor deprived child
that
probably yeah
um i heard you did you start with a book
or did he like any of the books
yeah i mean he i think he picked up this one briefly and we started to read it
got a couple pages and then he got distracted by something else
okay
we have some books similar to this at home with the feel touchy feely
farm animal type
and how about the um any of these animals
would he does he have anything like this at home
any stuffed animal type things
he does have some stuffed animals
um he's got a winnie the
he's got a few others
but he's very usually not very interested in them
at least for very long
okay
and then did he did you show him any of these we have here
i showed him some
we played with the puppet
and he thought that was
i mean you know it was a talking puppet
he thought that was fun
he kinda gave the puppet the cookie or the puppet took it anyway and he thought that was funny
and we read a couple pages of the peek a book because he really likes peek a
which i guess is normal
yeah that's pretty normal a lot of kids like those things
but yeah he's ripped the we have one similar at home and he's ripped the one of the things off
right he's ripped the flaps
like that sorry
they're very strong i think that's happened before
um and how the baby
here i can take that if you don't
how the baby did he see that
i don't know if he saw
he didn't make it over that far
does he is he in any kind of contact with younger infants
no i mean he doesn't have regular contact with other babies i mean occasional but not daily or anything
some kids are really interested
which is probably good because he'd gouge their eyes out and then bite their forehead
right some kids are really interested in babies
right because they
checking it out
he sure is
especially those eyes huh
oh and i meant to ask i know does he have any thing like this at home some
he has some sippy cups
he picked this up and held it for a while but he didn't pretend to drink from it
and not the bottle either
no he's never had a bottle so
oh here it is yeah
um okay and then how i saw him putting toys behind did he do anything else with toys
he threw them
doing that with them
yeah are you giving me kisses
very expressive
eat the baby's face
um let's see and
um let's see and oh i don't know if this is a question you can answer
is the way he's playing typical for the way he'd play at home
um well he hasn't attacked any baby dolls but then he doesn't normally play with those
um for the most part yeah
there aren't as many toys at once and he's usually more interested in exploring the room because he's familiar with those toys and
so he'll you know he'll play with a toy and then he'll walk over and like i was saying his big thing is dropping it on the other side of the baby gate or behind the furniture
sometimes he seems to want us to get them back and sometimes it's just a fun game to put them all somewhere else
move the stuff around
um but yeah he wants to explore everything with his mouth
he's exploring the room now
yes
remote controls are some of this favorites
okay
um and then we probably asked you last time but uh does he have i asked you about stuffed animals but does he have any of the plastic toys like that at home
i guess he doesn't have fake food
but he has
he has um he has plastic teethers and i let him play with a plastic spatula or a plastic measuring cup of things like that
in the kitchen
we have some spoons here did he play with those
he didn't really he just kind of picked it up and pushed them aside
okay so he saw it
right
very interesting
well i wonder if he recognizes that as a human like
i think he probably does because he
you know a lot of babies will give baby kisses where they're just kind of attacking your face
like he'll bite my and his dad's noses and stuff and kinda do like the open mouth thing to show affection
at least we think that's what he's doing
that's what he's doing to the baby yeah
of course the baby can't defend itself
from more aggressive
right
from more aggressive affection
and he i know you said he has books at home like the lift the flap um do you think he prefers toys or books
at this stage
um i don't know i guess it depends
i think he prefers things that aren't toys or books just objects that grown are playing with
i see
but um i don't know sometimes he likes us to read
i mean a couple months ago you couldn't really get through an book because he'd just try to grab it and eat it and he still tries to eat books but he also will sit and let you read him a whole book
okay
yeah so it depends on his mood i guess
right and time of day
yeah first thing in the morning we often read books
you eat the plate too
you must be hungry
it's lunchtime
i think it's lunchtime
okay so
um what did he like the best
apparently that slice of bread
the slice of bread
though he picked up the cookie right away it's probably the only thing that looks like something that he eats so far
uh huh
so he he looked he played or whatever um was interested in the other things but maybe not things that he already eats
no he peas he eats peas
okay
just like this so that he would recognize that as a food but
okay
most of them he's just picking them up to explore with his mouth
but you said the cookie
not that he would have ever one that's got m and on top but that shape
like that
and that color
how things like the spaghetti
no
no
he wouldn't have known what that is
and the bread even he's never had bread that looks like that
he's just picking them up to eat them he puts things in his mouth
so let's see what did he pick up
he picked up the cookie
and the peas
and the bread
and the waffles
and
um i don't know if anything else he picked up on his own
the hamburger
okay
just kind of curious about the shapes he was going for
uh things that fit nicely in his hand
yeah
this was too big and this is too big
okay
well that's not too big but it's too big for him to try to get into his mouth
those straight shapes
the thinner the thinner things
i see that works for you
um alright so those seem to be what he was interested in more than anything else today
right
some of that is teething
teething yeah
some of it is lunchtime
did he look at any of the um like utensils and uh
only to use them as noise makers
okay
not tee well the spoon he stuck in his mouth but maybe as a a spoon
hard to tell
yeah
and does he have anything like that at home or daycare
um well yes spoons this size but that's about it
i think sometimes in the nursery he'll he'll see play food
probably puts it in his mouth i don't know
he has these two books at home i'm surprised he didn't
oh really
want to look at them he usually loves looking through those at home
so he does
are there particular times at home that he likes to uh look at books
i don't know
some people say you know before bed they read
no he has uh one book we often let him have in his crib
it kind of calms but um most of the rest of time he'll just be playing and he'll one off the shelf and sit down and flip through it
alright so he likes those two but he wasn't interested today
i don't know why
nope
and any other books he showed interest in today
no
okay and any of the stuffed animals did you show him any or did he go for any
i showed him
okay the chihuahua scares me but i showed him the otter and this goose
he was pretty uninterested
he's not he goes through phases with stuffed animals sometimes he wants to hug them and sometimes he doesn't care
how the baby was he interested at all in that baby
i didn't even pick the baby up
and he didn't go over there to it
no he doesn't see baby baby dolls very often
so you don't any of those at home
no
but you have some stuffed animals that he likes on and off and he has books that he generally likes
a couple
and the usual baby
like we don't have many of this stuff it's more like toddler toys
right
we mostly have like stacking rings and blocks and stuff
and he likes those
yeah
how um did you notice any differences in what he liked today or how he played with the toys today compared to the first time
well last time he didn't show any interest in the food
i think that i think that in the nursery that he's in um twice a week they the older kids have play food and i think sometimes he's been following them around now that he can crawl
so he hadn't noticed it before he was able to crawl but now that he can he gets over to what there playing with
so he's probably seen it
so maybe he's it's a little bit familiar to him
and he's a little bit more mobile now i'm assuming
right right
yeah
i was surprised he didn't ranged around the room
well that may be next visit
yeah maybe it's still a comfort issue stay close to mom
mom's not ranging around the room which is good some kids zero in on the wires and then that's it
hard to get it back
well let's see if there's anything else
we try to keep away from wires at home
yeah good
and so do you think he recognizes the names of any of the names of these
you said he may recognize the peas as something that he eats as food
right
any names
um of these particular things i don't know he might recognize the words cookie or peas but
not enough to make him look up so
okay
i think he more recognizes that we're going to the place where we keep those things
okay
that makes sense
um alright i think that's
if he hears the phrase like
more peas please
then he knows he's getting more to eat
but i don't think he necessarily knows that peas is what he's getting
right
little bit young for that maybe so
alright well that's all i need to ask is there anything that i didn't ask you that you think that um we should know about what he likes to play with
no you don't have many toys that make noise
no we don't it makes the audio hard
i guess so yeah
yeah um
like he lo he has a couple different like he has xylophone two different xylophone toys that he really loves
you know with the mallet
yeah
stuff like that
did he have toys that you push a button and it makes music or some kind of
not very many
um just we don't buy them
yeah
yeah so just ones that were given to us
yeah we don't have very many
i guess yeah that would make the audio
it just makes the yeah
even the stuffed animals aren't really animals that make a lot of noise
no i don't think any of these make any noise
so usually if i pick up an animal i would do a noise or something with it
press a
no i mean
oh you would make a noise
yeah
whatever noise the animal makes but
some of the things like the otter
an otter and i don't know what noise a zebra would make
well the frog some people do the frog
frog and he chicken
and the chicken and the dog
but yeah that's that might be a bear
i think that's a kangaroo
kangaroo
oh yeah yeah right
got the yeah
i don't know what sound they make either
fox yeah i don't know
it is what it is
anyway that's about it um
so we'll let you guys go to lunch
you alright there daniel
just kind of got used to use in here didn't you
doesn't taste very good
can you give a kiss
give a kiss
no
okay
i'm ready to ask you some questions
okay
um well first of all what did she seem to like to play with
well let's see here
the pizza
the pink ice
not the white ice
she liked the keys only after i gave them to her though
okay
that that cup and then back to the bottle
this is like always a staple
so i'm thinking
um
we recently have gotten into giving her the bottle
trying to wean her from breastfeeding
and so she sees th her bottle and gets excited
and maybe that's why she's uh you know drawn to this one
she may recognize that's a bottle
and she saw the liquid in there and she's trying to get to it
but it's not real so she doesn't know that
but uh still she keeps going back to the bottle
out of all these toys the bottle
well she's showing her preference huh
but she did play with th a few other things
oh yeah um
she likes pooh
again we have pooh at home so she
but when i went to go give her the duck she
same reaction as this
well not as as intense as the bee
but i i'm no i think she likes colorful things
i don't think she likes dark colored um um i don't know
i i hate to associate black with scary but i think she just doesn't know
i think that colors are more vibrant and less threatening to her for some reason
i don't know why
um even this one didn't give her the bad reaction that this duck did
and then of course she just doesn't
i think that's a texture thing
right
those little tentacle things
she doesn't like that
did you show her anything else that's a like a darker one
yeah i did
the um otter
and she would she wasn't she didn't cower away from it
but you know this i don't know what i don't know what the difference is
but she did not like this one
and the zebra
she was a little leery of the zebra
interesting
but um but the otter
when she i was trying to get her when she was hugging pooh
trying to switch her up to get her to hug the otter
she wouldn't hug the otter
no way
so do so is it mainly just pooh that she seemed to like
that she hu that she hugged and kissed
go ahead momma
i see you
how about the dog
did she do
um she liked the pink poodle
she
yeah she liked the poodle
but she might just be like her sister
a pink fanatic
she could be
and al you know children's toys are often colorful
so she may just be used to that
to the colors
right
this is this is pretty
you're doing so good
but i don't know i think this is pretty
but that's me as an adult
i can
it's hard
yeah
i see what you mean
they're trying to make it look realistic
but most children's toys are really colorful
are really colorful
right
hope you like that
and she did like the pizza
um and the oh the green peas for a long time until they fell out of her reach
and now she's just looking at the
you like that
and how about any other of the um food items
no
she picked up the pastrami
but that was it was just to whatever trying to get to something else
yeah she did mess with the cookies this time
i know last time she did she had the cookies in her hand a lot
um but she did like the pizza
and th and this is you know significantly smaller than pizza that we eat
so but maybe she recognizes the shape of it
yeah i wonder
but we don't eat pizza a lot
so i can't image that you know she knows what anything what this is
maybe she just likes the colors
and and the fact that it's kind of um pliable kind of you know soft
ahhah
that texture
ahhah and she is teething so maybe when she put it in her mouth it helped her
she didn't want to look at the book
she did not
nuhhuh
she liked the um only the peekaboo because we play peekaboo
you know and once i started to say you know and show her
and then she she you know she's like yeah i like that
but at first she didn't want anything to do with it
i had to come back to it a second time for her to to see that
it's great that you showed her a range of things
you showed her everything
yeah i wanted her to see everything
yeah
just so we could get an idea of what makes her tick a little bit and
you see that
yeah she looked at the clock and she tried to take the eye off
yeah
everybody's
you can see that that's been done so many times too
that's right it used to actually have hands
i'm sure
it has a soft kind of texture
wow
how about this
kind of
an eagle
yeah
i don't know
do you like it
dropped your pea
let's see
okay so if there's anything else
does she like anything
these are supposed to be kind of like blocks
oh gotcha
did she like
well i was trying to show her the peanut
but you know i don't know if she associates the word with what it is
yeah
yo her sister is only just now coming into being able to have peanut
so um you know she doesn't get exposed to it a whole lot
right
she hasn't heard that word so much
nuhhuh nuhhuh
let's see um
but when you mention that they are blocks
they do make a noise
look at that quinn
look
i don't know if they are
but some of the kids treat them like blocks
they yeah
so i've thinking of them like that
and they're really flat yeah
they can be stacked
hey
look at that
yeah you could put them like that
don't you
maybe the next visit you'll do that
ya see
some kids pick up these and then
yeah see
ya see
how did i not know it
you see like soup
oh it gives
delicious
okay and i think
oh and then um the baby
did she
yeah not so much
no
not so much
she she looked like okay
i tried to giv show her the bottle
she took the bottle from me and didn't want to deal with the baby
so no no takes on the baby
no takes on the baby
i guess that's a good sign
yep yeah
does she have toys like these at home
yeah she does
she has a lot of stuffed animals
she has several babies
um but they are a lot smaller tha you know um this one is more almost close to her size
i know
but she has several babies that are um probably a you know maybe a little this size or a little bit bigger
okay
um she also has some little babies too that you know but
they have diapers and bottles and even has a little stroller that she likes to play with
oh
wow she has
but um she has blocks and her sister's legos
she likes to play with those and make a mess and throw them all over the place
quinn
but this walking
she just took her like first few independent steps last night
and now you can't tell her she can't walk
that's great
that's that's gonna be
you're gonna be doing that all the time now
now that you know you can
yay
go qwynnie
go qwynnie
i see you
and she does a little i did it dance
go do it
can you do i did it dance
so proud
big girl
you're a big girl
okay
yeah
you've covered everything
i think you know our questions you covered everything
or i don't know
i'm a teacher too
oh that's why
so i try to analyze things
i was gonna say
i have questions and you answered everything so
i can appreciate what it is you're doing
yeah that's why
whoops
you are a teacher
that makes a difference
and the way you showed her things
yeah
you put things together for her and how they work together
although i don't work with the prim
i work with sixth grade so
but still
there must be something in just being a teacher
yeah
woah look at you girl
i see you
i see you
well let's um turn these things off and then she can have a new toy
okay
she prob i'm glad she probably forgot about that new toy
and ask you some questions
oh no
not at all
looks like we had some fun here
she likes the food
which is no surprise because she likes food in general
she likes to eat
she loves to eat
what kind of things was she was she into
shh the fo she loves the food
like it really really really got her
she really liked that
because like she like stuffed animals she really didn't care too
i mean she liked the bee's hair just it's interesting
you know the baby she liked the eyes and stuff but
can i have my pen please
she wasn't nearly as interested in any of it as she was the food
come here amelia
amelia
come here
come get this
were there any particular food items you thought she was like really into
yeah she really liked the pizza
she loved thi like yelling into this
yeah
she likes making her voice sound different
she she and her brother do that a lot
she liked the ice
the where's the spaghetti
she liked the spaghetti before too i remember that
and i think this bright red the contrast i dunno if she likes that this one
ice there she goes
she likes the ice
did she like this one
yeah she liked the waffle she was clapping the waffles together
i thought it was interesting too she'd get two of the same and tr clap those together
oh yeah
which i thought was interesting the pizza and yeah
and so
you were reading a couple books to her
she likes books yeah
i mean she she loves um karen katz she has a few of these
she really likes that one
course like rip the flaps up all the time
yeah
but that it's you know but
and she likes any of these with the animals that she can feel
we have a bunch of these at home too so she's used to those
does she know any animal sounds
she doesn't make any yet
no
nope not yet
and she has this one at home too she likes that one too
so she likes that
but she don't can't recall her making any animal sounds yet
does she know cows
no
she rea no she doesn't yet
she just i mean just like a few months ago she just started talking like just saying the mama dada
oh okay
she'll parrot us
but i don't think she makes any sen
like if we say what does a cow say she doesn't know what to say yet at all
yeah
so
if like her brother says a noise she'll parrot it but she doesn't know what she's doing
so
did she like um the
oh she she she wasn't she gave it kisses but that was about it
she wasn't as interested
last time she really liked the baby
she wasn't as interested this time
which is interesting
there she goes
she wants to kiss it and chew on it
i think she's teething on it actually
okay
yeah so she likes baby real babies but she's not as she wasn't as interested
i think because we don't have any of the food at home
oh okay
and we have tons of babies at home
and i think that this just really is stimulating her she doesn't see it and she likes it she really does so
right in the mouth
everything yeah
right in the mouth
everything
all day long
what's this amelia
she's got the keys
yeah she she likes
and this we feed her little peas so
okay so she
how can i eat that
is she into any of the
she wasn't today
no
i mean just the bee with the hair
even when i mean we have this winnie the at home
so i thought
but she she didn't care
she didn't care about the puppet at all
which doesn't surprise me
we have a puppet and she her brother loves like when we play with it and she doesn't care
she's just like eh
so
but yeah
hey you clap
she likes that game
clap
she loves clapping and dancing
she's a little dancer
do you ever do peekaboo with her
yeah
she does peekaboo
it's more like when um i'll hold her like shirt when we're changing her we play like then
oh yeah
so she does peekaboo
and she'll do pattycake if you play with her
her coordination yet is still she's still having like trouble figuring out but she'll play
she does this
does it taste good
she likes to clap a lot
and she just started clapping the two two toys together this past week
so i'd say about a week now she's been like banging toys all all over like
yeah
she's a good eater
she is
and we're lucky
her brother's very fussy
so it's like she's so easy and like it's gonna be the situation where as they grow up he'll be li she'll be like hey you gonna finish that
and he'll be like you can have it
you know
he just doesn't there are days where he just doesn't care to eat at all
and does she do you have a i heard you mentioned a um a dog
do you have a dog at home
we don't
but they're around dogs all the time
we live in a community where they're constantly walking dogs everywhere so we see dogs every day
alright
so they like dogs
and my their grandparents and all their aunts and uncles have dogs
so they're around dogs a lot it's just we don't have one
okay
our neighbor has a dog chico
uh who's a little chihuahua
so they see chico all the time he's always in the back yard
i don't know where yeah but the chihuahua wherever he went
oh here he is
looks just like without the pink collar
yeah
looks like chico
yeah
she says this isn't fair
bottle
is that your bottle
pretty close yeah
she's trying
she's doing pretty good
yeah
second babies i think
her she just hears her brother talk all day long and she just say i mean she'll he'll say stuff and she'll just be like trying to say it too
so i think that that really makes a difference
yeah it's good that she has someone to kinda chat with
yeah
yeah
yeah
she likes the ice
she does
alright well i think that we are done
that's good
alright
oh let's see
aba
ba
i'll start asking some questions
okay
i was tryin to get her to talk she does normally talk a lot
where's all your babblin
where's all your babblin
someone needs toys distracted
alright so what do you think she liked the most
oh definitely these
okay
definitely these huh
that and the food
she likes the food still
how do you think she liked those so much
i don't know she can put in her mouth
probably oh we have a lot of this stuff at home too
kitchenny stuff ye just like last time she didn't gravitate towards the stuffed animals other than she was fascinated by the tag in this one at first
but other than that ye didn't want to play with these too much
i tried showing her a couple of but
we didn't want to play with animals too much did we
she liked all the plastic stuff she put a couple of in her mouth
but uh we have not it's not actual measuring spoons but she has a little a baby one that has like three spoons on it and it's the one in my diaper bag and it's definitely one of her favorite things i don't know if it's the noise or
definitely one of her favorite toys that i don't go without
it's so funny
and she she ate she ate a couple of the your ice cones she did put in her mouth and her and the peas
i know you guys like to wipe this stuff down and the bottle she fed herself the bottle
and the cup
yep don't worry we'll clean up
and we fed the ba
that's her new word just like in the last week she started saying that ba
ye
ba
i can hear it clearly
it's so funny
i mean sometimes she'll stand up in front of the mirror ba
that's cute
baby
you're the baby
because see we have a lot of baby dolls at home but her older sister my older one's not real into that stuff
she's more of a dress up and dance than the kitchenny stuff so i don't she doesn't see the older one do it as much so it didn't seem to i thought i just assumed you know she'd follow the older one you know that's why this stuff is all over my house all the time
so i don't know if she plays with that that's what she kinda knows from our kitchen or what
i'm hopin she'll be a like a mommy girl
my older one's not real into that
do you try to um you know play with the baby in a way that's
yes baby
in a way that's very um similar to how you would normally act with a baby to show her
ye that's what i was tryin to do with her ye let's feed the baby and we put the baby's sock and try to get the shoe on
so that's what i was tryin to do was play with her you know like we would take care of the baby i don't know if i did a good job but
we tried
what do you have allison
do you have peas
what do you think of that
so what was her favorite toy last time if you could remember
i think it was somethin in this stuff too i don't remember if these were actually here i remember the keys
was it all the same stuff
it was
i don't remember i think it was this stuff too
the noise makers and the food the plastic food last time she was really hooked on these
the waffles i remember that
i don't know if it was the texture you know
this time it was the peas she kept picking up the peas or
the ice but i also showed her the ice and she loves to eat the ice
right
i pointed that out to her
i pointed out the pizza to her but she didn't pay too much attention to that
do you think she recognizes some of the food
as the play food that you have at home
she might we have ice at home ye i think as play the play food ye not as the real food
ye i don't think she was quite makin the connection that this is like i don't know i don't think she's quite there yet that she eats real ice too i don't think she got that
i tried
but ye i don't think that was
what about these items do you think she recognized these
the bottle ye definitely
i think cause she instantly put it in her mouth
so i think she was doin with it like she does her bottle
and the cup too because i've been working with her on her sippy so she automatically went and put that in her mouth too so i think those she did you know think they were like hers
that tends to happen
ye
so do you have a lot of toys at home that make a lot of noise that maybe
ye probably
ye she likes the ones that make noise that that have lights and singing
she loves anything with music
oh you the baby
you see the baby
baby that's good
see now see that's the first time i've ever really seen her like label it like correctly i didn't know if she really knew she was the baby or she just likes to say baby you know i don't know
that's what's fascinating about them
no no we're not playin with that
ye we went for that one time
ye i guess they make so much nowadays with all the lights and the movement and
ye
we do have a lot of those types of things and she loves that stuff she'll stand up and dance
you wanna show her dancing baby
show her dancing baby
you love show dancing baby
there's dancing baby
there's dancing baby
you dancing
show me dancing baby
let me see you dance again
dancing baby
do dancing baby
not on command she does it better when she's holding on to something the standin thing we're a little unsturdy on ye
but we have those things that you put on the fridge you know and you hit and they play the music and you know
oh ye i know
so we have the animal ones those leapfrogs and then we have one of the one the older one has the letters so she loves those things she'll hit those things constantly and stand there and
dance
very cute
ba
did you have a lot of stuffed animals at home or
not a ton and you know what they're kind of from we have the older one has a lot she not as many and um they're in kind of in this canvasy thing and my older daughter doesn't play with them much so they don't come out much
ye
so they just kinda stay in there so they're not all over the house
definitely not
maybe that's why
ye
she's not really into them
ye
there's a couple in her bed you know she has a couple special ones that are hers in her bed but
she doesn't really sleep with anything yet like under her arm she sleeps with her little blanket
that's what she wants under her face
are you showing off
you're so happy
you showin how you can stand
say i wanna walk
so what about the books which one do you think
she liked the peekaboo one
and we got through a couple pages of the good night one last time i reading her this one the touchy one and she wasn't into feelin it i was makin her feel the stuff but she didn't really i don't think it did anything for her i didn't try it again this time though
but she liked the peekaboo book and that's when she was sayin baby a lot
so i she was kinda makin that connection too there you know of the baby she won't that's why when you guys asked about the peekaboo thing she plays it a little but like she loves it when we play it but she's not really doin it herself yet she's not actually doin peekaboo herself
got ya
so that's why i said a little
like she likes to play it in terms of like mommy and daddy or someone else does it and i laugh but she doesn't totally do it on her own yet
right
not quite
say not quite
so is there anything else you think we should know about her language or what she plays with or anything like that
tryin to think
i don't think so
not that i can think of
ye most of the stuff is like you know buttons she likes any she likes like a piano we have this musical piano thing
and she likes hittin things on that and it's lights and music of course too ye
so ye i guess she does kinda like that kinda stuff
ye you're the baby
you're gonna have to pull more of those babies out for her to play with
ye
i guess so
now those are kind of all over we have like the stroller and we have the shopping cart and we do have those kinda things so
then i'm wonderin if like if she starts playing with them if the older one will then play with them more it'll be interesting to see
yup
because i have a niece that's in between these two and she's really into the babies and into changing them and all that baby baby stuff much more so than my older daughter so i'm wonderin if this one will be like that you know
it's so funny that's what i had to get her for her birthday she wanted clothes for her babydoll whereas my daughter was like nah i don't need anymore clothes for the baby you know
she wasn't interested i said okay she wanted dress she wanted every princess dress thing there is
that's what she wants she's into the princesses and
gow
that's funny
so you see it made noise
you like that it makes noise
you like noisy things i guess you're used to noise around the house huh
and you like to swim in the pool you're a swimmer
right you like to go in the pool
and ye she says momma meme she says meme usually dada baba and baby
the new one that's about it
right
i think that's all of our words that we say
ye we didn't have too many to fill in that we can say yet
that's okay
oh speaking of which can i by any chance get a blank copy of that word list
that i had to fill out
ye do you have one i can get my any chance
i with my daughter i i i kept track like i asked for an extra one and then i wrote down when she said each word it was just neat i have it for her so i'd like to do it with her
ye
of course i fill the thing out and forget to make a copy of it before i even
oh that's okay
you know so i was like oh i'll have to remember to ask them for a blank one of that
and then it's easier it makes it easy too when i have to fill it out again i can i already know what i've been fillin in each word she says so
i don't actually have to think about it you know i just kind of went through and filled in the bubbles as she says more words you know
once they really start talking it gets crazy i remember
oh you took the key aw
that would be great i'd appreciate it if i could get a blank one of it
ye we'll get that for you
we'll be really excited to see you again in a month
in a month we come back
okay
when do you want her between ten and a half
um ten and a half and eleven and a half
and eleven okay
so maybe the end of september
okay
okay yup that'll be good
can i call
ye
i don't know her schedule yet and i can try and schedule when the older one can be in school too so
perfect
that'll be good
we wouldn't have to bring her next time
but she hasn't started preschool yet right
haven't gotten rid of that big sissy yet
preschool always starts later she doesn't start till like the middle of september
oh wow
ye like the thirteenth she goes back so
she's got a little while
is it okay if i ask you some questions
so what do you think that um hailey liked the most
um probably the waffle or the ice cone
why do you think that she liked those
um just she probably is
or the spoons
i dunno she just spends a lot of time spent a lot of time playing with those toys
hailey
hailey
that's not really a toy
here honey
always happens right about the end
she's like mommy's not paying attention to me i'm gonna grab something else
keys
are they stuff that she eats
the waffles and
um no
she eats like little itty bitty finger food so none of it resembles things here
so she's not that familiar with them
i mean she's more familiar with spoons but
does she have um do you think that she knows any of the names of the some of the foods that you played with today
um probably not
because she doesn't ever see it like this
maybe like that she has pasta but um
oops
uhoh
uhoh spaghettio
oh we'll get you cleaned up
we'll get you cleaned up
i heard some gurgles
no wonder
no wonder hailey
new shirt
uhoh uhoh
ew
party in there
alright kiddo
clean
what were what was something that she didn't like to play with
um she really wasn't interested in any of the stuffed toys except for this
she was really interested in that but
um she doesn't play with stuffed toys very much
even though we offer them at home
she doesn't really play with them
so it's pretty much similar to here
do you do you think she knows or is familiar with the animal names
do you talk about animal names
we do now um in books mainly
we i mean she probably doesn't know all of them like that we of through in her books but
she probably knows dog cat because we have them at home
but um probably
i think she recognized it like she understands bee
she knows what a bee is
but other than that i don't think so
okay
not yet
um did she like playing with the doll
i was surprised she didn't seem interested in it at first but she kept on going back to it
albeit very roughly
she yeah she went back to it so i was surprised
i had never seen her with the doll so
we don't have any of those at home for her yet
so yeah i was surprised to see that she was interested
what kinds of things were was she doing with it
um well very roughly patting it's head
um and playing with the baby's arms but
um mainly just patting
um were you trying to get her to play with it in any particular way
um i i tried to i guess i tried to bring her closer to the doll
and um i talked about it
um and i guess i just when she like engaged with it i sort of encouraged it but i didn't like try to push it on her after i saw that she wasn't really interested in the beginning so
yeah
uh how books
she up until now unless it's a touch and feel book she pretty much just besides a few books that we have at home she doesn't she mainly listen like i just read it to her as she's playing
she doesn't really listen to books yet
so we s but there are a few books that we have at home that she's she's mainly for the tactile
so
so she's into more like the tou the feeling
yeah if it has that sort of thing then she's engaged but if it's just like a flat book she doesn't seem interested
how um in general what do you think she likes most about her toys
do you think it's like texture color noise
probably noise
we have a lot of toys with noise in them
um and tactile
i think
but
probably those two
what do you think in here kind of fits into that into those categories for her
probably tactile she was playing with the food toys mainly and she was like putting it into her mouth and manipulating it so
um yeah probably the the play food
so
like none of it makes noise so
she would definitely have been engaged with something with noise
um but yeah mainly the the play food
okay
does she is she using spoons
um we let her try to use a spoon at home
it doesn't really work yet
she's just beginning
for right now
has she um and then is she is she eating more solid foods
are any of them in here
um
she has like pieces of bread and she'll have pieces of pasta and pieces of cheese
but no we never just give her like the whole piece
so
right
yeah
you smiling
what ya doin over there
and so you don't ever play with she's not really into stuffed animals at home
she'll play with them but like minimally
she'll pl she'll touch it pick it up look at it and then put it down
so
figure out what it is and then leave it alone
yeah
pretty much
if it doesn't make noise or like feel or react she's not as interested
she's not as engaged
hailey that's not a toy i'm sorry honey
uhoh
that's not a toy
here let's play with the waffle and spoon over here
come here
here
come here baby
oh i know i know it's not as f
but i want to play with that
i want to play with that
aw she's nice
yeah pat the baby
pat the baby
oh your tummy
yeah so we don't i mean we don't have most of these toys at home besides the books but
she uh clearly likes the spoons
yeah
she does play with wooden spoons
big wooden spoons
while we're
oh that's not a toy either
what kind of toys
um lots of like she has a lot of interactive toys
but um then she'll also just sit there and play with a spoon or she'll
i guess she has a lot of
oh no
is she in that phase now where she's gagging herself
i think so
yeah
i didn't know that was a phase but my girlfriends have a lot of kids and they're like
she sticks everything really far
so i mean i guess we just have a lot of we have a lot of different textures and shapes and um
oh she's really more into the things that like she's really more into her walking toy now
oh okay
so she's a really active kid
so i mean as you can probably tell
um so she's mov she moves around a lot
like really she would enjoy climbing up the stairs just as we much as like this
yeah
active activ active things
overall
okay
where are you going
oh yes
that's not gonna be stable
okay
here
okay well i think that's all the questions i had
okay
unless you have anything else you wanted to add
about her playing at home or here
um
you're gonna go back
she's very single minded
that's another thing that she's doing now
she gets something into her head and
she sticks with it
yes
she's rocking her own chair
hailey
you're gonna do a face plant
i don't want that to happen to you
you will cry
and hurt yourself
i know i'm sorry i'm such a meanie
what is that
oh hailey
alright well we'll stop so then she can
what's going on
oh my goodness
oh my goodness
um what do you think he liked playing with the most
this little spaghetti thing and that one and the baby
that's interesting
i dunno why
that he kept these almost the entire time
then he would whack the baby on the head with them
so apparently that's what he really enjoyed to do
did he um does he have a baby at home
no
like a babydoll
no
no
no he's got lots of he has uh like little animals but no babies
okay
we're a you know a family of boys so we don't have babydolls
wow
don't you dare
you come here
does he um so how does he usually play with his other animals
he usually gnaws on them
gnaws on them
yes
was he doing that with uh these
yes he was everything goes in the mouth
so he usually eats anything and
we have a little one of those rubber like bracelet things
that is big enough that he can chew on it and it doesn't really and i'm not too worried about him being able to chew through it
but everything he he chews everything
so we have a lot of hard toys that he chews on
and he likes to rip paper and eat that and
he has a couple electronic books that he'll flip the pages and it'll do like music and stuff
oh that's really neat
so i guess di how did he feel about books here
not today
he when i was doing i was doing a peekaboo book and one of the little uh papers fell out
and then he got interested because it was something he could chew on
aw
so at home do you have the paper books do you use paper books
not with him
no but his brothers have paper books
okay
no wires
that's usually what we do when you're crawling around huh
no wires
but we tried this one too and he touched it for an instant and then he was like yeah
then he was just like nope
more interested in the spaghetti thingies and banging 
is that typically what he does at home too
more into toys than books or
yeah for the most part until he realizes again that they make noise and then he likes to smack and then they make noise some more so
was there anything um
has any of the books that you read do you think any of the words in it or the stories were familiar to him
well i know like in this one we've got the uh they had ducks and the sheep and stuff and i think he knows that they're animals
if nothing else
so we've been to a farm before and so they he's seen them before
but i dunno if he really understands like what they are
but i was just trying to get him to touch the soft
we have cats at home and and they're soft too huh
when you're nice to them
how the peekababy boo book
we do peekaboo at home
but not with a book
but we do peekaboo and uh he seems to he's starting to understand that you're still there
so he starts to look around the hands looking for so
aw
yeah
oh now you're gonna find other things huh
what's that
bee
how the foods is are has he tried these foods or are these any of these foods that you played with today or that you talked about are they foods that you've had at home
he has had um spaghetti type things at home but not they don't look like this
but he's seen us eat it
um i'm just not we're just not there yet with him
with the these particular like actual
but he's eaten bread before which is why i was kinda surprised he didn't go for the bread
did you bring did you present it to him
yeah i put i put some something on it
and he just was like whatever
and then he did the same thing that i
i put plates down too because i feed him like green beans and stuff on plates and and he didn't want his spaghetti on the plate
so he took it right back off
huh
that's what you did
yeah
how any other foods that um you tried to introduce to him or um that might be familiar
no
that he picked up
nope just he was more interested in
well he's got the peas now it looks like
he's had peas before
actual peas he likes to squish them
oh yeah
but um but yeah no the only things that he was picking up were the the spaghetti
that was it
oh now you're gonna use the spoon huh
so today was his first time kinda playing with baby and doing things with baby
well he did that the last time too
oh okay
he noticed the baby the last time also
and was interested
but he plays with his shadow in the window and in the mirror so
and uh so he's he sees himself and so he knows he's joe and he knows what he looks like
so i think that seeing the baby doll is enough of a lookalike th for him
huh
so do you um what did you notice any differences from his the first time he came and played with these toys
well he seemed to not be as interested in as many things
it seemed last time he was more willing to look at other things that i you know showed him
and this time he had more of an idea of this is what i want and so this is what i'm going to do
oh that's funny
but he also wasn't mobile last time and so he's mobile now
and so at home usually it's you know the wires it's always wires with him
he takes after his father
huh
yeah
are you gonna talk to the baby
yeah
has he had peanut
no
no
but he i think he liked the fact that it rolled
okay
i i put it up and he bangs on things so i gave him this and banged on it and he's like no not gonna bang on it today
huh
how any differences between do you have any of these toys at home
just i mean we have a variety of st the stuffed animals but again he wasn't really interested in the stuffed animals
but he did i think recognize the bear
we have lots of bears at home
and so i think that was something he he recognized but yeah
the rest of it yeah he wasn't he was more interested in these
things he can shove in his mouth and
that makes sense
things he can chew on
he's got five teeth and he puts them to good use
um do you think that he's got any um attraction to color
like um for example the peas are green and the frog is green and
um just some things that he's been um were there any trends across color
no
not really
i don't think
it's you know he well he's going for red things now it looks like so maybe he's more interested in red
but his brothers have uh favorite colors are red and blue right now
so we have a lot of red and blue things
so but even at home when he has a when he notices his bib and what's on his bib he has a tendency to if it's colorful
like we have elmo ones
he seems to play with the bib more than he wants to eat
okay yeah
so it's very possible that he likes red
i just wanted to i always ask parents if it's you think it's the noise it's the texture or the color you know that's really making them gravitate towards particular toys
yeah
um across the different toys
yeah
yeah i don't think so
i mean he's now he's more interested just in food in general it looks like
yeah
he uses his feet a lot like that
it's so funny
he pulls things closer to him with his feet
with his feet
he'll he'll kick and kick and kick and he's realized that things will come closer to him sometimes
it's really funny to watch him
huh
yeah
yeah
um is there anything um that you noticed that was different um this time that you wanna add
i know we kind of talked about it
this time from how he plays at home
that's funny because when we play at home honestly we don't usually when i'm with him i don't usually play with like the toys
we have a basket of things that he can you know go and play with whenever he wants to and he goes and he you know picks everything out and knocks the bu the basket over and stuff
but he and i we we throw you in the air and
huh
yeah
we've been working on his crawling more and his standing on his own and and things
but yeah he he's pretty good at just finding things
entertaining himself a little bit
pretty much yeah
he's he doesn't need me which has been a help
that's great
every so often he gets it in his head that he really needs me but for the most part he's pretty independent
i think it's of his brothers his brothers really entertain him
and i'm not i think i'm not as interesting as they are
well they're smaller
yeah
right
a little bit smaller yeah
yeah
they're six but
but yeah they're shorter the
and they tend to uh not pay as much attention to him sometimes and so he's he gets into more things when they're around than when i am
oh no
i'm just surprised he hasn't gone after the wires more
that's his favorite thing to do
go after wires pull up pull chew on 
huh
that is your favorite thing to do at home
pull on wires
that's too big for you
that's too big
so um i think that's it
okay
for this portion
can i ask you some questions now
sure
um can you tell me something about the play session today about what you guys played with
um mostly the food
and he likes spoons and stuff that i give him in the kitchen
so he's playing with like the measuring spoons and stuff like that
um
he's really into throwing things
no no no no no no
we're not going after camera
i know
huh
huh wooo
yah
so
that's the best remedies we don't ever have to say no
yah he just kinda throws things around right now
bangs things together
um
sometimes he'll sit and listen to me read for a little bit
oompfh
no
you're a quicky
you are so quick
come on over here
let's look at the toys
yah look at these toys
aren't they amazing
no
look at the toys
huh
so you were saying he likes he usually plays in the kitchen
in your kitchen
yes if i'm like cooking i'll usually give him some plastic spoons
like serving spoons
there's a like a um cabinet that he's allowed he can go into that has like the tupperware and stuff like that
he just gets out and throws around
he likes to bang
right
do you ever put like sound effects
well sometimes i'll give him like a metal bowl
and i'll have a wooden spoon so that's a lot louder
then the plastic
so he likes that
or i'll put things like in a water bottle and give him like an empty water bottle so he can shake that
yes that the baby
you gonna kiss the baby
give the baby a kiss
no
no
now we're done with the baby
does he have any dolls at home
um
no he has stuffed animals but he doesn't have any dolls
is he exposed to other infants or
um at um
daycare he has but
they're not younger than him
he's the youngest
he probably knows the word right
or
um
i mean he's heard it before cause my friend
we were just recently around my friend who had a baby
we were talking about baby
that the baby
yah
well how about tell me about the food
did he play with it today
yes
he definitely played with the food
i think he liked um the wooden toys just because they were heavier
and then when he could bang things against it
then everything goes in his mouth
i mean he likes peas
i don't know if he recognized the peas or not
yah that's the baby
you give the baby a kiss
you gonna give kisses
oh
woo
that hurt
yah give kisses
that's funny
yah so he likes things he can kinda just toss around
okay
you think he'd recognize any of the names of the uh
um
or they're familiar
i don't know
i don't know if we
have you ever had waffles
you've had pancakes
but i don't know if you've ever had waffles
yah i don't know if he'd really recognize any of the names
well tell me about the food items he did tend to go for
um he was playing with the peas
and um
the waffle on his own
and the pizza
i introduced the burger
which he started playing with
um
i think the spaghetti too
i might have introduced that but he was playing with that
and he got some of the plates
oop
and that's pretty much what
he just throws things
that's what he does at home
you get the spoon
can you feed the baby
when it comes to the food do you think he was attracted to the color or the texture or the names you were giving them
um
i think probably the color and maybe the texture
he's like a big
now that he's solid foods he's like a beggar
so when he sees anyone eating food he wants real food
you know
so i don't know if cause it looks like real food it was more interesting to him
um
he's like i won
right
where you going
you just walking now
oo you gonna sneak over there
come here
come here
yah hurry
yah
oof
oh our pants our long
yah oo and we just got these shoes and it's hard to walk in shoes
um how about the books
um sometimes like when were playing he'll want me
bring me a book and i'll read it and he'll sit and listen
he didn't seem too interested
this one he had seen in the waiting room and he likes all the touching feeling books
okay
did he like any particular animals any feel for any animal or
um he really likes
he always like the ducks
i think he likes the pig feeling one too
oh that's a different sound huh
do you um have any of these books at home
um no i don't have of these
we have things like that but we don't have that one
and we have board books but they're not those
um do you ever play like patty cake or peekaboo
yes
yah
he'll play pattycake
he'll do peekaboo
trip you wanna play pattycake
or that's very exciting
you play patty cake
yah
pattycake
so funny
what are you doing
yah
that's all very exciting
can i pull your pants leg up
yah oh there's another spoon look it has monkeys
it's there you go
um
oh right we're talking about the books
yes
was there anything different about how you played with the books or
um the items in the books that were interesting
not really
i mean usually i'll see if we're sitting down and playing i'll see he wants me to read him a book or he'll bring one
and then i read it as long as he looks like he's interested and then when he stops then i stop
okay
and how about the stuff animals
um at home he plays with stuffed animals a little you know
a little bit
but all of his are bigger
so i don't know if it's like the size is different so then he wasn't just interested in them
or we don't have any of the plastic foods
that might have been more exciting
where as we have um stuffed animals
we don't have any puppets
and he really liked the puppet
um
and there's not really anything that
like this dog doesn't look like our pet dog
but he did like he liked this one
i don't know if it's the pink uh necklace thing
were there are there um familiar animals in here as far as their names or
um the goose might be familiar because when we go on our walks we always see canadian geese
so i talk about those while we're when he's in the stroller and we're walking around
but he didn't seem to really recognize it
any of the farm animals
um
he's been around horses
and um that's about it
of the animals
what were his favorite the if you had to pick the animals that he liked to play with the most today
which ones were those
um
well he liked the kangaroo puppet
and then i'm did he touch any other
trip come here
what are you doing
um
yah i don't know if he played with any others really
were there ones that you tried to get him interested or thought he would be interested in
yah
like the dog i thought he didn't really care about that
um
i set up the groundhog for him
he did touch it but he didn't really do anything with it
he threw the fox
that was set up
i gave to him
come here your pants
um
yah but other than that he didn't really play with any of the other stuffed animals
okay
oh did you guys play with the magnets
yes
yes
was that new
yah these were new
or i don't remember them last time
um but he didn't seem to be really i mean he touched the head
and i was trying to show him that they come together but he didn't really seem to notice that too much
okay
uh what do you think was his favorite thing here today
probably the spoons and banging things on the peanut butter jar
he liked that
um
he liked the plates
and putting the he was playing with the spaghetti and the peas
he probably played with the peas the most
yah
what do you think was his least favorite thing
um
least favorite
i guess probably this little stuffed dog
he didn't really seem to care about one of those
trying to get him to play
or he wasn't really interested in the peekaboo book at all
is that fun
was there anything here today that you thought he would really enjoy playing with and he didn't
um that's a good question
not really
well i did think he would like this book more
just cause we do have something like this where you have to lift things and he'll do that
he didn't seem interested in this one
so yah i guess that would be what i thought he would enjoy more
and was there any toy in here that you thought um that you knew he was gonna be drawn to and he was drawn to
that kind of fits his personality
the plastic spoons
cause he plays with those so much at home
and that's because of the noise
yah he just likes to bang it on everything
is he putting a lot does he put things in his mouth
um not as much as he used to
he still does
but not as much as he used to
yah we like to put everything in our mouth huh
oop
what kind of foods is he eating at home
um he eats pretty much anything we eat
the only thing he can't have is bananas
but other than that
you know i just cut it up small and he eats anything really
oop is that your bottle
has he already gotten like the treats like the normals like kids treats
yah
that your baba
oop
um yah so he's pretty much had anything
everything
so that may have been why he was enjoying some of the food
right
some of the you know kids food
um
not the kids food but you know
right
real food
he has had like he'll my husband will always get ice cream and he'll have some of his
yah can i get the sippy cup
i don't think it works
he's really trying
yah
i don't think there's anything in there buddy
oop
you okay
alright well i think that's it for today
okay
i think we talked about everything that you played with
was there anything that we didn't talk about
i don't think so
you're just happy to be here
oop oop oh you okay
you're okay
excuse me do you think it's okay if i ask you some questions
yeah sure
okay
um so what do you what did you play with today
we played with i was he was really interested in the baby at first
so we were playing the baby
and then the bottle and the sippy were a big hit
and then um the ice cones and the pizza slices
the food related items
and then the bee a little bit and the clock
what did you think um why do you think he enjoyed playing with the food
um we don't have anything like that at home
um and honestly i think
well the bottle and the sippy we have at home
and i think he likes to play with those
um but the the like fake food stuff we don't have it anything like this at home and i think the shapes felt good on his gums
everyth he's teething so everything goes in his mouth
um so he was just into exploring the different textures of them
you think he recognized any of the names of the food
um maybe the ice cone but probably not anything else he's um we are slow at introducing solids
um i wrote in my little um form we've we're investigat investigating he might have a food allergy like with dairy
so he's he's only on purees and i haven't made a huge deal about food just yet so
um he probably didn't recognize anything
he has a book with like a picture book and it has ice cone in it so he might recognize that from the picture book
okay yeah i noticed you were intro you were showing him a lot of different foods in the pile
yeah
yeah he um he probably wouldn't know anything you know he wouldn't recognize them at ho from at home but since we don't have these at home i was showing them to him
okay
how any um any of the stuffed animals or any of the animals
he doesn't really get into the stuffed animals so much
um i knew he would like the bee because we have this mister brown book and whenever we get to the bee part with the buzzing he was really into the buzzing so um
but stuffed animals he kinda could care less about
he likes things that make noise
um and he can bang together
um yeah
doing it right
yeah
um have i noticed he's playing that um playing with those two items
the peas
yeah
yeah i think he's frustrated that he can't like break apart that to put it on the spoon
or maybe he just likes the sound it makes when it runs up against the texture you know
i dunno
was he interested in um the measuring spoons as well
i thought he would be more interested than he actually was
because um he has a friend who has something like this and he loves to take them and play with them
the sound and i think um probably he likes the shape of it in his mouth probably
is he exploring at home with the same type of things
yeah we um he will sit for several minutes playing at home with pots and pans and like uh spatulas and whisks
oh be gentle with that honey
um yeah so like kitchen um utensils and things he he's into
um so you said you have some books did you
oh you know what i heard that you were singing rock a baby
um is that something you sing
sometimes um i will just ro like play around and rock him and sing it
so i was seeing if he would notice when i was doing that to the baby he seemed to get a kick out of that
normally like i rock him like not to go to sleep but just for f to be funny
um like to play around with him
and he thinks it's funny when i do that to him so i was seeing what he would do when i did it to the baby
and it seemed like he was he got the the joke of it i guess
yeah i not you were playing quite a little bit at the beginning with the baby
yeah because we don't have a babydoll like this
it actually it reminds me of like a toy we had when i was little at my grandmother's hou you know it's old school
um and um i've been showing him we have like birth announcements on our fridge of other babies
and i've been showing him the photo cards like baby baby baby so this was a good
and of course he he's seen babies
but this was a good opportunity to be like here's a babydoll you know
we don't have one at home
okay and but he's seen other babies or
oh yeah
yeah
yeah i always try to point out other ba like live babies
where are you going silly
toys everywhere
um and then some of the things you were doing with the babydoll
um can you talk a little bit about that
yeah sure
um i was trying to see if he would um make the connection like the baby and the bottle this is how you you know bring the bottle over to feed the baby
um i was trying to point out it's body parts
um that's something i'm trying to teach him
you know it's hard to tell you know when he's supposed to be able to uh pick that up
but um yeah i mean we have books that are like you know um that mention the body parts and i always try to reinforce it like these are you ears this is your hair these are your eyes you know that kind of thing
so i was doing that with the baby
to try and reinforce that you have eyes the baby eyes everybody has eyes that kinda thing
did you want her attention
he's funny
he's really funny
how the keys i also noticed that you um
i thought he would like the keys more well he i he has a tendency to know like what's real and what's a toy you know
um because he's really loves my real keys
um so i was trying to get him interested in this but he wasn't really very interested with everything else
um it's like he has um fake cellphones and he's more interested in the real cellphone than the fake one so
so he gets it
yeah
yeah
unfortunately
interesting
yeah i mean the minute we offer him a real cellphone he's like yes but
um hang on honey
there we go
that's for grownups 
um yeah
he knows the difference between the real ones and the fake ones
alright
okay so i think that's all the questions i have for you today
okay
you explained everything that you did
okay
um i'm just gonna before i shut off the recording i'm going to i think just put some the i d on it so i just need to get close to you
okay sure
oh
sorry
today is july twenty seventh two thousand ten
this is participant six seven five seven j c
and this is his visit at um ten months
i have a few questions for you
okay
so um do you remember what she liked last time and has it changed
i think she focused on the food a lot last time and she's focusing on the food this time too
anything in particular
food items
she likes this meat
and i don't why because it's not very colorful
maybe it looks really like it's real so she she's kind of eating some real table food so she might be more appe it might be more appealing than some of the stuff that doesn't look as real
maybe it has to do with the texture
maybe
yeah
little bumpy
and she's teething it could be soothing her
but she's not sucking on it really for her gums so i'm not sure what she why she likes that
she te she was g she liked the doll at first and she does seem to like babydolls when we see them in the store and what not
she's just very nurturing already
she likes to feed things
that's about all she
she could be just hungry but she just seems like that's her focus is to feed it whatever it is
she was feeding the dogs
but she wasn't as interested in the stuffed toys
i think last time she did play with them a little bit
she was really not interested this time
especially not unless they were the two little dogs
if it was pooh she looked she didn't wanna even look at pooh
um she likes the spoons
i don't know what her fascination is with spoons she's that way at home too
and she didn't really give me much attention on the books
normally she likes books
so i can't say she's necessarily going for the things with lots of color
she seems a little interested in this bottle
and she's not nearly as talkative as she normally would be but maybe that's because there's so many things in front of her
yeah
what's that
what you find
spaghetti
yum you had spaghetti last night for dinner
i was gonna ask you do you think she recognizes any of the food items or anything
um maybe the ice
this might have been interesting because of the colors i'm not sure
it looks interesting
and she does she's not really eating ice so i'm not sure if she's relating the two
she could be looking at that spaghetti and thinking it looks similar
she ate the noodles last night
she likes keys
she didn't play with it as long as i thought she would
but she did at least look at it and kind of hold it and twist it around a little bit
and she really i think her favorite thing was these peas
so i dunno if it's the texture the color she eats a lot of peas so
she could think they're real
are her peas that she eats are they like mushed up or are they
nope
she did eat mushed peas but now she's eating regular peas
she likes peas and carrots that's her favorite food
so she could have thought those were real
yeah definitely
yep
that's about
but she seemed annoyed when i kept trying to show her the stuffed animals
i want food
i want to eat
look kennipoo
you gonna feed them peanut butt
oh you like this one
okay
yeah you like his shiny hat
you gonna feed him some dinner
i'm hungry kennedy
can you ple give me some cookie
please
kennedy
excuse me
can i please have a cookie
i notice she kisses most of the stuff too
whatever it is she kinda kisses it
or bites it
that's an interesting
kennedy
your friend is awake
kennedy
you like her eyes
eyes
mouth
mouth
eyes
yeah
eyes
eyes
good job sweetie
eye
eyes that's right
eye
eye
that's right
eyes yeah
you like her eyes
her hair
can you say hair
hair
don't hurt the baby
say hair
don't hurt the baby
kennedy
why are you pulling her hair out
you don't like the baby
hair
hair
hair
hair
yeah hair
eyes yeah you like eyes
do you have babies at home
she loves like babydolls
already which is kinda strange
she's kinda young to like them but she does
don't hurt the baby
why are you hurting the baby
she's your size baby
so do you read a lot to her
and do you have any of these books at home
or similar
i have similar things not these
this one looks kinda familiar actually
no
i don't have any of these
i have one like that with the touching with the different textures
and we do read a lot of doctor seuss they're just not small like this
but i have baby books for her
that size
um what else was i going to ask
do you have lots of toys at home that make a lot of noise or what's her thing
does she like toys that make noise or
um
like is it more babies or is it more reading
she likes noisy toys
the stuff that she can bang on and it would like she's got the little piano thing where you stand up and walk around it and it has different sections on there where it makes different sounds
and then she's got a we got it for christmas a microphone toy
so she likes to turn the microphone all the way high
and then yell in it
nice
and stick it in her mouth and yell
so that's probably her favorite thing to do with them with her toys
um and she likes babydolls
she likes the ones that move
you know with batteries or something but
those are probab
stuff that lights up
probably is the most interesting to her
and she likes to watch movies like intently
she doesn't even take her gaze off the movie it's weird
because we have movies in the car and she just the whole time she's watching the movie doesn't like to be interrupted
okay
you can take her to a movie theater earlier than most kids
probably i could
i haven't really tried that
my husband took her and said she was fine
but in the car she watches movies all day all the time
in the car
um do you play games with her like uh pattycake or anything like that
what other types of games do you play with her
um peekaboo pattycake i'll hide stuff behind my back or under something and see if she can find it
um she wants she likes to crawl down the hall and i come and chase her and grab her and say come back kennipoo and she'll laugh hard super hard
she thinks that's the funniest thing in the world
so i guess the chase we'll i'll chase her down the hall
um she likes to think she's gonna get away with something
god bless you
god bless you baby
so she'll take something and um that she knows she shouldn't have like a pen or something
and she'll look at me and then she'll try to run with it
she knows she shouldn't have it
and she laughs really hard when i'm trying to get it from her so she thinks that's so funny
oh that's funny
she's testing you already
is that your favorite
i think it is
yeah
like why are they not coming apart
i think that they do look the most real maybe out of all the foods
probably
do you have any food items at home
we have a full kitchen in our play room
she doesn't really play with that food though maybe she's not interested yet
or it's in her house so she's not
but she um
and actually she doesn't really like the play room that much which is strange it's all primary colors and there's a big soft mat to walk around on and do stuff
but i've brought her down there a few times and she just
maybe she's overwhelmed i mean there's a lot of toys i have a lot of children
oh yeah
she'll probably like it when she's older
yeah
yep
she was in a play
for christmas
she was
she was baby jesus in a big huge production
oh that's great
and she did really really well
she didn't cry or anything
little actress
yeah
kennedy
you like the peas honey
she's like i'm hungry
i think she's trying to say that
alright i think that's it
okay
do you have anything else to tell me
no
she seems just like she's right where she should be
she's doing fine
and she's got older siblings
a three year old a five year old and a seven year old
so she's probably gonna be a little advanced in terms of trying to learn to talk sooner
i think my three year old i've never seen any child talk as as well as she did and as quickly as she did
she was saying full sentences at eleven months
wow
she's not there
she still babbles
so who knows what'll happen with that
i think it's great when when babies have like older siblings to look up to
yeah
and just try to be like them
and she's um really close to walking
i mean she'll stand for long periods of time
she won't really take steps yet
she likes to bounce i don't know what that's all about
yeah i saw her standing
yeah she's she can stand with balance and hold stuff
she's she's really right there but she just won't do the steps
she'll just start bouncing really hard and i'm like
and she won't fall
so it's like she knows how to do it she's got the balance she just needs to
maybe next time i see her in three weeks she'll be walking
yeah she might
i think so
i think she will
she's ready
really
she just needs to do it
which is gonna be a whole nother other level of where are you kennedy
yeah put up baby gates
oh my goodness
she's all over the place
i've never used gates with any of my kids
i have a few questions now
um is there was there a type of a group of toys that she enjoyed playing with the most
she's playing with the food toys right now
is there anything particular in the food group that she wanted
the cookies
the ice
you wanna read the book again
and the hamburger
left foot left foot right foot right
uh was there anything that she was least interested in do you think
i 
animals
i dunno
mckayla you cannot eat the hamburger
uh does she have any toys like this at home that she plays with
yes
but she has mostly blocks
she has mostly her boys toys her brother's toys
and a lot of stuffed animals
but uh
and how old is her brother
two
so what types of toys does he have that she plays with
um trucks and cars and you know
he doesn't like girly toys and she wants to play with his toys
and dogs
see she likes the teddybears
no you can't eat the doggy
can't eat the doggy
you wanna kiss the doggy
dogs are not pink
okay
and does she pay attention when you're reading the book
yeah she does
and does she have books at home
yes
is there uh one that you read to her a lot
i read different books but they like doctor seuss
but she'll pay attention she'll pay attention at night to the entire story
um do you ever play with pretend food or anything like that at home
does she have any of those
we don't pretend with the food
no
they're gonna eat it
do you think she recognizes the names of any of the food
she knows what the cookie is
she definitely knows what this is
she knows
that's why she had it for so long
and she knows what the pizza is
she knows um lemme see
she knows most of her foods by by sight and by word
so if you say you wanna cookie she's gonna sit there and look for the cookie and then she's gonna see if it's a type of cookie that she wants
she knows what she wants
say and that looks like the cookies that i like
it's chocolate chip
um is she using utensils or anything are you trying to get her to use utensils or anything yet
no
am i supposed to
oh i dunno i'm just wondering
i dunno either i know her brother does but
sometimes they like to play with some of those
she plays with the utensils but not at not at feeding time
right
i was just wondering
you're not gonna i gotta cookie in my bag
uh do you think she knows the names of any of the stuffed animals that you were pointing out
she knows probably the name of a dog
everything else i don't even know the name of so
and maybe a bee
maybe
and maybe a zebra
but other than this i don't even know what these animals are
you should have little cheat sheets for the parents
like um what is this
um
exactly
what is this
otter
you think it's an otter right
okay
what is this
ya'll are terrible ya'll should know these names
what is this
looks like its from a a character from a movie
it does but what is it
okay
i don't feel bad then
hold on
what is this
i think that's another otter
alright i'm gonna give you that one um i that's what i assumed but i wasn't sure
hold on
see some of these critters we don't even know what they are so how are we gonna teach them
okay i know what that is
okay i know what th
okay
yeah
i just didn't know these three
okay i know what that's a fox
alright
yeah ya'll should ya'll should take um animal lessons
so you can tell us when we're wrong
okay
i'm ready
um i noticed that you were saying some of the sounds like what the dog said and stuff like that
do you think she recognizes
they do
that they do
because when they start seeing them live they go mama ruff
meow
say when i learn how to talk i'll already know what they are
and um does she have any of these books at home
she has goodnight moon
um she has doctor seuss but i don't have this one
i don't have these this one either
but she has a lot they have um i they have this children's club books and they send me books all the time
so a lot of them are like hard like red
like last night i read them it was called the red book
and it's everything red and you're just talking about you know apples and strawberries and and you know anything that's red
and then you just read red
and then one night you read yellow and
you know they'll sit there and pretend like they're listening
great
you hungry
say i must be
i'll go feed you
say i still have a cookie
she still has the cookie
that's a shame
that's ice
ice
and there's my cookie
no it's not caillou
say caillou
caillou
so you said that you read her a lot of books at home do you think that she prefers to listen to the books or does she like to play with her toys or
at night they
i think it's because they don't want to go to sleep it could be
but they'll sit there intently when you read the book
if they don't have if she didn't have all this distraction she'll just sit there and let you read the book to her
and then sometimes she'll try to you think she's talking or whatever she'll get the book and look at it and you know try to play with it
that's a bear
say roar
roar
roar
are you showin off over there
now i'm gonna ask you some questions
okay
you did a good job
alright so what was the first thing that he went to
first toy do you remember
um i showed him the bee
um i don't know what he went to on his own
probably the keys
or no actually the book i'm sorry
yeah
does he play with so he went to the the bee that was like put together like that
um does he have any stuffed animals at home
he was some but i keep a lot of them put up because they're like little stuff attached to like his brother has
so i don't have a lot of the stuffed animals out just a couple
yeah
so he doesn't really play with those that much right now
so why do you think he wanted to pick up that first
this one
yeah
probably it's different
he probably doesn't see much something like this that often
yeah
and anything sticking up attracts him
you know the little antennas or the wings
yeah
you kicked your shoe off and your sock
so so he liked he went to that bee and then he looked at the keys
does he have have this at home
yeah he has them on a ring
like the baby keys
yeah
so that was familiar to him
they're not on a ring like that it's they're just by themselves
right but they they're shaped similar to this
so it's probably why he they look familiar
and he also has the teethers that look similar to that so maybe that's why he
yeah
so and you said he also looked in the book
does he have that one at home
we have one similar
the goodnight moon without the counting
so we we have um it looks almost exactly like that from the front
so big
do you have a lot of books at home
yes
is that something he
we read every night before we go to bed
him and his brother and i
we read
um what was there anything that just was not interested anything that he did
he didn't really play with many of the stuffed animals i had to introduce them to him
um i showed him the clock and he kinda waved that around but he didn't really go to any of the food items at all
um we have at home so i don't know if maybe that's why
because he's seen before
his brother has some of this stuff now
yeah
so i can't think of anything
he didn't look at that
he didn't look at anything over here at all
usually at this age they are all over this stuff like on their mouths and everything
yeah he put the well i i showed him the ice and he put them in his mouth
but i had to show him um he's very concentrated when he plays he doesn't wander a lot
so it's funny he'll stick on the same thing for quite a while and we have a lot of toys in our playroom
so he's very content with one or two things a lot of times
yeah
it looks like he likes that bee
it's really cool isn't it
yeah
so you don't do you have anything like that at home
similar
um we do have some like um like a pizza at home
and bread
um and he does play with the spoon a lot um at home
so these should be familiar to him and we also go to the library where they have a fantasy area where he can play with this kind of stuff
and we were actually there today looking at um like in a kitchen area
so he's he's familiar with these items
yeah
here you go
so do you think maybe he likes to play with that he doesn't have
i think maybe and they're um anything that like looks um that sticks out he tends to draw his attention
that he can play with with his fingers
he's very fascinated with touching things
so he likes to um you know check things out a lot
like he'll crawl across the room for a speck of leaf on the carpet
yeah
yes he is
um
don't put it in your mouth
yeah
so do you remember the last visit when you did this same type of thing
yes
um are there any changes
he's definitely a lot more um interested in new things
i think before he was still a little younger
and i in the last couple months he's definitely blossomed a lot more
now that he can crawl he's out he'll he'll explore a lot more so i think um he definitely tries more than he did before
you playing peekaboo
don't put it in your mouth
good job
so you would say that this time he looked at a lot more than he did
i think so yeah
last time i i had to really initiate it a lot more
and so i think this time he um
even though i'd initiate some this time he was a lot more interested on his own and try to crawl up and play with things that he wouldn't have before
yeah
and what about the doll
that was not really
doesn't interest him
it didn't this time at all
i dunno it's we don't have them at home
yeah he has a brother you said
yeah
and he i mean he goes over to somebody's house to play that's a girl but i don't know if they even play with it there that much
you're so big
you're so into you're so big
so what do you think
you said you read to him every night
what do you think he prefers books or toys
um
he likes the reading the books or
i i think it's probably about the same but i think in general he seemed to like the toys a little more
um and do you think at this point um as opposed to different from last time that he recognizes the names of some of these items more
like some of the animals
he may
um i haven't really sat down with him lately and and had a lot of one on one time with him
um so that's probably not as good as it could be
yeah
potty training his brother has been a been a new priority lately so
oh so they're close in age
yeah his brother's three
oh
and he's ten months so they're just a little over two years apart
okay
um so do you think that there's anything else that you just noticed about this play session that you might want to add that anything that was like maybe surprised you about what he liked to look at or what he wasn't interested in
no this is pretty much the same type of toys he would see generally
it every day it changes with him so i can't think of anything special or different or anything
okay
go right ahead
absolutely
um so what toys do you think seem to uh captivate her interest the
most
seemed like the food one that it was last time too
the food
any sort of food in particular
or just like in general
i mean mostly she was playing with the pizza and the hamburger
you were playin
mostly those right
yeah
how did this visit compare um to the last visit in terms of like
what she played with
um i think she played with a few more this time
but not many
she did play with those last time
which is really funny
yeah
we don't have any
food at home
so it seemed it grabbed her attention both times
she was much quieter this time i think
just really it seemed strange
she just seemed really quiet today
do you think she knows the names for any of these items
no
do you think any of them she recognizes
like like you have any at home that she'd recognize
the books
um
she's used to books
we actually have a couple of those
but just books in general
are you sharing
are you sharing with me
thank you so much
that was yummy
thank you
ah
yeah
uh
stuffed animals in general
we have so those i'm not surprised
but
what stuffed animals did she seem to like
you sharing again
thank you
she wasn't really fascinated with any of them this time
she didn't really gravitate towards any of them to stay with for
any period
does she watch um any cartoons at home with like animals in them
or
um
no not really
if the tv's on it's of her brother's shows
so she does
we haven't any like watched any of the like really baby ones
or einstein any of that kind of
so unfortunately you're not seeing those on tv are you
no you're not
nope
nope
in general what toy or story seemed to interest her the most
at home or here
um anywhere like
anywhere
um
you're into cars and vehicles
your brothers play with them all the
time
you're just like your big brother
she is like her brothers
she chases and follows them around
what else do you tend to like now
you li
what do you like
you like playing the music ones
you like banging things around
but our our house is with lots of cars and trucks and
airplanes
and so you usually
go over to the boy's toys instead of the baby toys
yeah i know
and trying to walk
that fascinates her walking around
getting as far as she can
on
furniture
and exploring how far she can move over
right
sounds like a fun life
it is it's a pretty good life
was she interested in the baby doll at all or
not so much today
a little bit more last time
um
but she does have a baby doll at home
and she will play with that on occasion
i don't know
maybe this one was just too big
well just because there were so many other fun things to try
what did you like today
what did you like
so many choices
you really like that pizza
she does like the pizza
you like all the colors on that
or is it just a really good size for your hand
and you like the microphone now
can you let got of that
thanks
did you hear it makin noise
i heard it
from you grabbing it
i heard it
um
so you said you don't think she knows the name for any of these
or recognizes them
i really don't
i mean she's a good eater
so she eats a lot of food
but i don't think she recognizes if we say do you want cheese or
pizza
i don't think she she knows knows that yet
i don't
i think you recognize your name
and when we say mommy and daddy
i don't think you got like
animals
or food yet
so cute
how old are her brothers
three and five and a half
oh wow
they look out for you
they do
usually
what um
do they play together or any with any toys or
yeah
um
like i said the vehicles anything that moves
um
they'll run around in the house in a circle
and she will crawl around and chase them
even though she gets lapped over and over
she will continue to rotate around the same circle with them
don't you
you do
you do
and they'll sing to her
and then when we do any kind of little
uh songs
they try to jump in with us and do them too
right
will they sing their abc's to you
or if we do ride a horsie into town
your brothers always have to get in on it with you
yeah
of jealousy
she's not used to this much time i think though
you know one on one time for thirty minutes
is that's impressive
yeah
isn't it
you getting upset
you want that microphone
yeah
where you gonna go
where you gonna go
should we get another one
what do ya see
do you see winnie the
ah
where's winnie
oh no
okay
i'm a hold ya
i promise
what
i know
yeah
you gettin hungry
oh
what
well if i mean that's pretty much all
that was all the questions
okay
um just when do you think you could come in for her third visit
we try and schedule one like ten months and then another
one eleven months
okay
um
we can talk with
you have a calendar handy or
now do you want her to be eleven months or around then
um around then
you can go
num num num num
okay we're good i just have to ask you a few questions and then we're all done
okay
good job
yay
you're such a good baby
yippee
uh okay so what toys did she seem to be most interested in
ah the food
food
she didn't even touch anything else
haha and um why do you think that is
do you have any food at home
we don't and i don't know if that's why because it looks different
she doesn't have a lot of stuffed animals either
so i i don't know why she gravitated towards that
the food that she was most interested in
uh and was there a particular food that she was most interested in
the pizza
she kept grabbing
and wa what was she least interested in
um she did look over at that stuff but she didn't even care about the stuffed animals
uh and does she have any stuffed animals at home she plays with
she has um an abbykadabby
and um she has a um a bigger teddy bear
that she kinda looks at but she's not really interacted with
um and she was looking at the books over there do you read books at home
we read books i think she was more looking at this
oh she was looking at the
but um i don't know what she was really looking at because she didn't grab for anything
uh and did she look at the doll at all
not that i noticed
so it was all food uh do you play any kind of games at home like
um yeah we do races at home because she's a fast crawler now and um we have a dog so she just learned how to throw
so now we play fetch before she would sit on my lap and we would play fetch and tug
um we do peekaboo but she doesn't seem interested in that
she's bored with that
oh okay
sometimes she likes bubbles sometimes she doesn't
there's no really way to tell
it just depends on her mood that day
um and she has this um wire
a toy where you move the balls
okay oh yeah yeah
and she likes that
we play with that
yeah are you still playing with food
uh and has there been any changes since your last visit
um
like which toys she is playing with etcetera
no it last time she gravitated towards the food as well
last time she grabbed one of the stuffed animals but didn't kinda like grabbed it and then saw the food and moved on
um and was she interested in the same kind of food did she pick up the pizza a lot
do you remember
i don't remember i think she was playing a lot with the spaghetti last time and the peas
she held the peas the longest
yeah you didn't even see them huh got to focused on the pizza
and why do you think she was the most disinterested in the stuffed animals
i don't know maybe just cause we don't have a lot the one we have is bigger and so she doesn't manipulate it very well
i guess she's just not interested in them
yeah um
do you have any of these foods like does she see you cooking with them or do you and your husband
um she just started eating finger foods
okay
and she's had little cut up spaghetti before
okay
but everything else's she's had doesn't look like this it looks pureed
um unless she has noticed eating sandwiches or pizza or whatever but
um the only thing that's here that she has eaten uh whole is spaghetti
okay
but it doesn't look like this its cut up
yeah haha
uh and does she and has she been trying to use any utensils lately when she's been eating her food
she tries to use the spoon um but it doesn't really work
i mean she she kinda gets the concept like that its supposed to go towards her mouth
but um she'll either hold the spoon backwards or hold it upside down and the food falls off
so sometimes if we let her have the spoon she'll take it and then grab it with the other hand and just shove it in her mouth
but she hasn't actually used the spoon
that's cool so little
yup
you're so little
and when you're at home what books does she like to read
she likes um well right now i don't know if i can say its her favorite because she speak for herself
but she likes um um
good night because when we read it she giggles
i think she's sort of anticipating like the next page um and we always point out the mouse
like we'll read the words and then we'll point out the mouse
um but she also really likes um anything that's soft that she can hold herself
she likes that
and anything that has elmo on the page
because she recognizes him so if elmo is in the book she likes it
yeah you like elmo
yup
and you said you didn't that she doesn't play with food at home
we don't have food toys we have a little um stuffed pot
like its a silver pot um and it has um i don't know if its an apple or a beet but it it looks its round and red that goes in it
but she doesn't play with the food itself she plays with the pot
um but its not hard plastic like this its um fabric material
yeah
and does she do anything else at home playing wise that we should know about
she likes to pull herself up now and that's kind of her own little game that she does with herself
yeah
um she's trying to stand independently so she'll actually spend a lot of time she'll let go with one hand
and then she'll sort of lean back and think about letting go and that kind of occupies her for a while
um and we also have um animal magnets on the fridge
so um that only holds her attention for about five minutes
but she'll play with them and take them off and put them off and that's it
what else do you do
what else
uh i guess now that she's getting older she is just getting into things
when she was a little younger was she big on any other toys at home
um she really liked her um its not she had the playmate with like the arches and she was okay with that but we had one that was separate um that was like an arch with three pulleys on it
and when you pulled them it made music
oh okay
and she loves that
she actually still plays with that
we keep thinking that we'll put it away and uh she'll see it across the room and just randomly play with it one day
um but that's what she liked when she was younger she loved the pulling thing
okay
we are all done then
all done
we're all done
did you hear that
she's playing
um so
what do you think was her favorite toy
um i think the
the foods
was probably her favorite
the spaghetti and the spoons
she seemed to really like the spoons
though it's amazing it's
it's not until the end that she
that she's interested in this doll too
so does she have one at home
she does not
no so that's why i think it's interesting
um what about food
does she have any of that
we do we have a lot of
yeah we have a lot of this plastic food
at home
so i and um
i don't we don't
don't have spoons though
i don't think
not that she plays with anyway
i mean she eats with a spoon also
she probably recognizes it
yeah she really seemed to like the spoons
maybe we should get you some spoons
when we go home huh
um
what of the food do you think she liked the most
um
i think she really liked the peas
she kept picking those up and
putting back down and putting in her mouth
she liked that spaghetti
and those are both things she eats at home so
do you think she recognizes any of the food
and like connects it
um yeah it's possible
i mean especially the peas
she eats peas a lot and she really likes 
so
she probably and that's pretty much what they look like
so i would think she probably recognizes those peas
does she eat any of the other foods
of these foods
no not really
well spaghetti
but that's about it
i don't think she eats any of the other stuff though
no not really
oh i guess maybe pear
oh and bread
okay you do eat bread
straight into the mouth
um what about the animals
do you have any pets at home
we do have pets
we have cats
but um
and we do have a few stuffed animals
um but none that look like these
per say
which ones did she play with
um let's see
well she liked that doll
you still like that doll
did you you didn't even really play with the animals
did you i guess huh
that's right
you even took the kangaroo and chucked it
so spoons and food and doll for you huh
yeah
um do you think she played with any of the same toys last time she was here
um you know it's funny she did
but only for a brief moment
she played with this one a lot when she was here last time
this dog with the pink thing
but um
she didn't she only picked it up for a second this time
but she did she did go right for it and pick it up and look at it
she put it right back down
but she did actually pick this one up
and she did play with this one a lot last time
did you guys play with the food last time too
or
no i don't think she played with it at all last time
i don't think she was interested
she was interested in the spoons though
she did play with the spoons a lot last time
didn't you
you got a thing for spoons huh
you wanna go home and get some spoons
you wanna go home and get some spoons and eat
maybe we'll go home and we'll have some spoons and we'll eat
and then we'll have spaghetti maybe
spaghetti
did you look at any of the books
um we did just for a moment
i think we looked at this one
and she was kind of interested in feeling it
but when i started reading it she wasn't really interested
there's probably too much else going on huh
oh now you're interested huh
in the mouth
that's the biggest form of flattery there is
you like that huh
oh now you're playing with it
it's amazing about the power of persuasion
that's upside down just so you know
there ya go
well kind of
there ya go
back upside down
oh well
nice job going from one hand to the other though
feel that
isn't that nice
so you said um
what you're having for dinner she can eat that too
or does she have her own food
oh she usually eats what we eat
yeah we just cut it up really small
yeah
so she usually and she just she just had spaghetti last night
and she loved it
so she does eat spaghetti
she likes it a lot
so did you recognize that spaghetti
you ate i heard from your dad about fifty pounds of it
i mean she doesn't always eat what we're eating but usually
depends on if she likes it
or if it's spicy
or whatever
well great
well i think that's all the questions i have for you
you know what
we're gonna go
we have to give our microphone back
so
what did she seem most interested in today
the ice cream cone
without a doubt
any idea why
um i think
the the texture them on those gums
plus it's just a good shape for her hand to grasp on to
was she interested in any of the other foods
a little bit into the pizza
um again you know it's got that texture on it and it's it's a nice size for her little hands but but
she was really into those ice cream cones today
and she liked the kangaroo
that's the puppet
she likes puppets a lot
do you like puppets maggie
it's interesting to me because my other daughter
is and always had been since
she was maybe two to three months old
huge book fan
so i would think
that
because that she'd have
tremendous language skills but she's actually very speech delayed
and this one really could care less about books
but her babbling and everything else like that is developing at a much more normal schedule
i guess you never know
no well i mean you know it'll i think
when they're older the book worm will probably have a better vocabulary
but as far as the development of the language it hasn't made a bit of difference
do you have any of these play foods at home
we do but they haven't been of interest to the kids yet
they just came at christmas time so
they're still into other things
um
yah i mean we've got some puppets
puppets and plush toys are the popular things in our house right now
and we've got the karen katz books and dr seuss
so those were all very familiar and she didn't pay any attention at all to those
does she use utensils
she has she tries to use her spoon
yah
mostly she just plays with her spoon
i can see that maggie
are any of these foods that she likes when they're real
peas she likes peas
she's never seen as peas
she sees them as mushy green globs
um
really she hasn't seen much of anything
well she had some pasta
last night with some some ground up sauce in it
so this kind of looks dinner last night
and she played with that for a moment
um
i'm sure she's sandwiches
well she gets waffles too
but she sees them as little bitty pieces
so i don't know that that would register
um anything else
no she probably doesn't see as it appears like that
what animals did you
i heard you guys playing with some of the animals
yah we played with the otter
and we played with
with the zebra and the kangaroo
we played with the baby
she loves the babies in her daycare classroom
and she's much bigger than they are
she sort of steam rollers them
but she just wants to love them and kiss them
and hug them
and that's what she tried to do with that one
it looked a bit like c p
do you guys have a lot of stuffed animals at home
yah she likes those a lot
and she her sister's baby dolls
she likes those a lot
she likes to just sort of drag them by the arm around the room
do you want to be
dragged by your arm around the room maggie
nope she just wants to me in charge
what do you have
is that the spaghetti
spaghetti
spaghetti
yah
usually it takes them a while to learn to say that one
yah
that's a big one
i think my brother was saying psghetti until he was six or seven
oh yah
let's just call it pasta
that's easier
pasta
okay maggie
turn everything off we are all done
okay great job
i just have a couple of questions for you now
um
what do you think tyler's favorite toy was
i'd say the spoon
what other things did he play with
um
the clock a little bit
anything else
not so much
and the other spoon
um are there any toys he played with last time maybe that he didn't play with this time
he played with the clock a little more last time
and i don't remember what else he played with
does he have toys like these at home
uh yah
similar
like which ones
uh there's play food at home and there's stuffed animals
and books
spoons
do you think he recognizes any of the animals
i don't know
probably not
he doesn't does he have any of those specific animals at home
no
he has dogs
um
pooh bear
okay great
that's it
yup
that's it
thanks so much
for coming in
i really appreciate it
cute
you gotta look at the book
i'm gonna talk to momma a little bit
okay
is that okay
so it sounded like she was into a whole bunch of things
what differences did you see between this session and the previous one
i think this one she was more exploratory with a lot of the toys here
then last time
before she kinda just and then that was it
and now she's been a little bit more
investigative
okay so
what types of things was she interested in particularly
um the food again
i do remember she played with the food a lot
and um but real with the bottles
which is interesting because she doesn't like bottles
so i don't know
um the cup
the spoons
she she loves using a spoon herself
um
doesn't let us help her feed her
which gets a little messy
um she wasn't really into the dolls
again
which i guess is fine
because we don't really have dolls at home either
doesn't make me want to go get one now
that's right
okay
animals you were going through some animals
yup she's she's really not into them
i it's so different
um she just she i guess she's more into the food stuff
than she is with stuffed animals
which animals did you try with her
i tried the kangaroo
the beaver
and the hen
and the goose
and the uh zebra
but she wasn't i didn't go any further because she really wasn't interested
um
alright so back to the food
which foods was she going for
um the cookie
my favorite food
um the ice
another favorite
and um
the peas
the waffle
the bread
because i tried to make a sandwich and she wouldn't let me
yup which is often the case
whatever i try to do at home she takes apart immediately
um
and the spoons
and that's really it
okay
beverages
weren't there some
she was oh um the juice
the cups
and the bottle
and once again the bottle
she never was in into the bottle
we completely we tried it
and then five six months said forget it
and but now she's like enthralled by this bottle
so i don't know
but she's not gonna go backwards now so
no we're not bringing her the bottle again
alright
um
i was trying to think if there was anything else that i heard that she was particularly interested in
it seems to me there were a few more foods was there
um she she touched a lot of them
the pizza a little bit but not much
the peas
the tacos
but not really
um
the waffle
the pear
trying to see the cheese
oh the sandwich making stuff
i guess
i'm not sure what the what this is but
good question
i'm assuming it's some sort of meat
but i don't know
okay
and the spoons
the measuring spoons
okay
well that's great
ah let me
i don't think it got her
her subject number in the beginning
seven four one nine e b
today is april fourteenth
she's very strange usually
she's like i really expected her to be over to those wires
and peeling everything
she seems obsessed with the plastic food
cause it's nearly lunch time
yah she's a lot
uh she was chewing on those peas
quite a bit
again i'm not sure the color or the feel
she obviously doesn't know they're peas
and the pear
but um yah i think i said this last session i need to get her some plastic food because she seems to like it
did she like those last sessions
yah
and i haven't got her any
you know so this is the second time she's seen it
we more like to have the books and the soft toys
then plastic toys
oops
we got this structure
was she interested in any of the soft toys at all
um not really
i mean like when i she knows when i do a frog at home and go ribbet ribbet
she was smiling
so she recognized that one
she seemed she smiled
um and i do that at home and she smiles
how about the books i
yah she could we have a peekaboo book at home that she really quite likes
um
and she tries to turn the pages and lift the thing
but she she seems more interested in the plastic foods then the book
no not really it's not enough for her i would expect
and she's at the wire
but normally she'd i'd have been chasing her around the room
we play in the basement and there's like one wire and she goes straight for the wire
most kids do
yah so i was quite surprised with so many wires that she didn't even
yes
but last time i don't think she was really crawling
she was you know this time she can crawl
almost walk
she still didn't move
strange
has she started eating any of these types of foods yet
um she's had like spaghetti bolognese
some baby form and peas
and that looks like zweiback bread which is a german twice baked bread
so i thought she'd associate that cause it really looks like it
um and the rest she really wouldn't recognize
pears yah she would know pears
uhoh
is that all
does she do that at home
yah
usually like reaches
and the peekaboo books she'll like try and and you know usually bends the peekaboo book
but at least tries to to get
and but she she really was showing no interest in the first session
she enjoyed the spoons and the food
and um do you go over animals noises with her a lot
yah yah i do that a lot
like i say like the frogs
when you do it she smiles like as if there was a recognition
she might have just have been smiling at the actualy sound of the noise
i don't know but there seemed to be some sort of recognition there
i don't really do any other animal noises i don't think
there was no all the animals i didn't know what noise they made
i didn't know what that is
or that so
and she did the cock a obviously
uh no
not not
i think she can meow
because we have a cat
playing and stuff
thanks luc
do you think anything's changed since the
last time that you guys came in
um no actually
she picked the same toys
what kinds of things was she most interested in
um
the all the food
food
so yeah last time we came in she wanted all the food toys
and
she wanted the food toys again so
does she play with those kinda toys at home
yeah she does
um we have um
we have a lot of play food at home
um
but we have the other stuff too we have books we have stuffed animals too she plays with all of them
at home
but i don't know
it might be the play
well i don't know the play food is in her brother's room
so sometimes that's enticing
do you think there are any of the foods that she might recognize
um
well she just ate a cookie before we got here so
so and i think she knows the peas
and then the cup she got real excited about
she's been learning how to drink out of a cup
okay
and she would know the pizza
i think she gets all excited when we have pizza at home
so
cheese
cheese cheese
i don't know
none of the
some of them she wouldn't recognize like she wouldn't know
um the burger
or some of the cans and boxes
so
which one would you say she was the most interested out of the different food
um
probably the spaghetti and th the spaghetti and the cup
probably the cup she was most interested in
okay
so
and was she interested in any of the books or stuffed animals
um she was a little bit interested in the books
i read her one or two books
i think i got one book two books two i got one this book she she liked by the last page she was like i'm done
and in this one she liked she's been liking like well she's been liking peek a books lately and then she's been liking books that have stuff you touch
um
and again by the end she was real interested but then by like almost at the end she was like that's enough i'm goin back to the food
so shh but the stuffed animals she didn't really seem to care for so
right
she likes them they're okay at home like sometimes she likes them and sometimes she really could care less
okay
were there any ones here that she liked
um
i don't know none that i know she was all interested in the food so
um
she would barely give them a second look
you said she plays with the food mostly at home
she plays with the food well she plays with her brother's toys so
and the food is in his room
um
we have books all over the house so
she plays with books at the house um
but the big toys she plays at our house are actually her blocks
um
so um
does she have any dolls or anything
she has a couple she has um
okay
she has actually she only has one
she has one doll and my son has a doll
um we got him one when we were expecting her so
um
but she'll play with them every once in awhile
um
but yeah her little baby she likes and she has a couple of stuffed animals that she particularly likes
but she's not
really
attached to any of them
what were those that she
um let's see the one that she really likes is a little bear you like your bears
um
yummy
and she likes kitties
she really likes cats a lot
any cat she sees if it's a picture or a real cat or
a stuffed cat she gets very excited about it we have two cats
so
she gets real excited about the cats
um
so
yeah her she really likes blocks
and balls
that's her other thing she really likes balls a lot
okay i think that's all the questions that i have
okay
the peanut
she's funny i know
peanut one of those things like we put it out on the table when she wasn't allowed to have it yet
then we put it on the table and she just
she could tell it was something that we liked
and she's like
she thought she could've had it
and she couldn't have it but she's like ah
like she was like i want it you know she was trying she was pointing at it and she wanted it and we were like you're not supposed to get it yet
so i felt bad for her we're like you can't have it yet
soon enough
she gets it soon
bad
but yeah when she plays the blocks at home we we for awhile she kept you know for awhile she was just she'd try to grab and just you know wreck the tower whatever if like someone was building something she'd wreck it up
but then we realized at one point she was tryin to actually build
she wasn't trying to destroy she was trying to build and she just couldn't do it
so she would take a block like she would um take a block and she would try to put it on but she didn't have the coordination to actually let it go it would the whole tower would knock over
so we had to tell my son we'd be like don't worry she's not trying to wreck it she's trying to help but she just can't do it yet
trying to help
and that kinda helped he would get all upset if she wrecked up his stuff and
and um
he realized that she was trying to not to help and not just wreck it up he was like oh
okay
but
what do you think lucy
did you have fun
oh they have this thing
okay
i'm just gonna ask you a few questions
okay
i see the lights
he can play with the toys if he still wants while we're
okay
asking some questions
um
which of the toys
um
seem to interest cayden the most
um
well he played with this bee for a long time
um
and the baby
and the books a little bit
hi
come get me
okay
yeah
which ones do think interest him
the least
and why
um
he didn't seem that interested in
a lot of the stuff animals
um
he doesn't really seem interested in them at home either
so i dunno
why he not just
i know
he just doesn't
um
doesn't really capture his interest very much
shh
um
yeah i know
and the food he didn't play with
today
and i'm surprised because
shh
because we have a lot of
food type toys at home
i know you're hungry
okay hold on
so i would've thought that maybe he'd play with those a little more
okay
shh
you know what
i know your hungry hold on ha
okay hold on
i'll feed you in a minute haha
okay
um
hold on
so do you think any of the items
um
that cayden's been interested maybe have changed since
the last time you were here
yeah
last time he was all over um
the waffles and the pizza
um
and i thought it was
i thought because it was similar to what we had at home
um he seemed more willing to explore
more unfamiliar toys this time
okay
i know your hungry
what would cayden probably prefer to look at with you
sorry
what kind of books do you think cayden would prefer
um he likes to look at the kinda where the
either
the pages
um
flip open like
you know they're folded over
and then they flip open
or they have little flaps that open
he really likes the
open and close ones
but he also liked that one with the texture
too
ow
oh my goodness your nails are sharp
does cayden play with some more toys at home
um
pretty s pretty similar yeah
yeah
um we don't have a lot of babies
but he has a sister so
sorta the same idea haha
haha
yeah
he does like to uh
get on on her and give her kisses like that so
wow good job
yeah your big on pieces
books or toys
um
i think toys
but he seems a lot more interested
whoops
in um
in
in books lately
just the last month or so
i've really seen him
kinda get interested in looking at books
more and all
um
even when he's playing independently now he'll look at books where before he would always play with toys
okay
okay
i mean you said that you do have pretend food at home
yeah
does cayden play with the pretend food at home
yeah he does he loves it
do you think
he recognizes any of the foods from the last time
that he was here or maybe some of them from home
um
he might
we do have a little juice thing
like the one he was playing with like this one
um
so that one is exactly the same
so that one's really familiar
um
we don't have the bread but he does
eat sandwiches
so haha
okay
ha that could be the connection
what ya doing putting that on top
cayden recognizes any of the names
of any of these
or other items or maybe he's beginning to
i feel that he is
beginning to get um um
sometimes i'll say
do you see the
fishy or something and um
he might not necessarily go get it but i kinda see his eyes going toward it
okay
so
a few things
yeah more he recognizes people
than things
yeah
hi
ouch that hurts when you pinch
okay
are you hungry you wanna eat
i'll let you go eat
haha
ha wanna eat now or go eat in the car
okay
he's a good boy he just got hungry
haha
yeah
totally understandable
okay
good
if you don't mind i'd like to ask some questions
sure
yeah
not gonna be writing anything down we're taping
right okay
so um
what do you think he enjoyed the most
the ice cone probably
yeah
yeah
it's good to put in his mouth and to chew on isn't it
the ice cone probably and the sippy
they're very familiar
i mean th the juice and the sippy
do you think he recognizes the
oh yeah that it's a yeah i mean definitely
he wasn't getting anything out of it but he certainly recognizes that it was something to drink
so
what other were there any other toys that you thought
that he liked or
that he liked or preferred of of the other toys
um
i think he had fun with the food toys we don't um
what else
the i mean it seemed evident that the ice cone was a hit
what else did he like to play with
th the blocks these little things when we made a little tower that seemed like it was good fun
and um
i think that's probably maybe the baby he definitely liked looking at he likes to look at paybee babies and point to their features and
didn't seem that interested in the book but we have a similar karen katz book that he's interested that he likes to look at the babies in so the doll
do you have dolls at home
we have um one little doll he doesn't give a whole lot of attention to
its um but um but books with baby's in it
and he has a little he has a big brother that he plays with all the time so
okay
yeah
and the books um does he prefer books over toys
i don't think so i think generally toys over books now at this point
so he's um
and it doesn't doesn't have to be a you know he doesn't obviously use the toy in the intended way at this point anyway generally
but um any things toys measuring spoons
um
bowls
keys
rocks you know
so
does he do you think he recognized the activity of that book that you read him
peekaboo
yeah
um probably i mean we do peekaboo so
yeah and we have like i said i think we have a peekaboo karen katz book
not that book but something i lift the flap something
um so i think so right right william wills
william
william
what are you doing
where
what do you see
felt that he was not
not terribly interested in
yeah
um not in particular i think he'd be interested in anything
there's a lot of toys here
so i think when when
um
i j i often find you know if there's just one toy he would be you know if if i were interacting with him with it he would probably be a lot more interested but there's a lot of toys here so
i think um any toy i think here he would probably interested in if there weren't other things to
to distract him from do you know what i mean
and the animals toys did you use any of the
not really i think i grabbed a little poodle at the end
but he he doesn't he's not terribly interested in the animal toys
i mean we have some stuffed animals but i don't notice him ever he's never taken like a special a special little you know stuffed animal to bed or he's not attached to anything like that
so
you mentioned you had the doll
we have one doll it doesn't look anything like that i would say it's it's not it's a soft doll with a flat face that's much more realistic
um
but yes we do have a my my my um my mother gave my first son a doll when he was born so we have that doll kickin around
are there any other toys here that you also have at home or
books
books
not the particular books we have good night moon
like i said we have a karen katz book
we and we have measuring spoons in the kitchen and sippy for sure
but other than that we don't have any other toy plates or food or things like that
we have keys right
okay so
i think i think that's pretty much it
okay
answered all the questions
do you have any questions
nope
no
what is this i mean what is general
who do parents are you do you videotape other moms or dads playing with their children how do they i'm just curious like i you know what how other people play or how
i mean its just i guess it varies quite a
uh
yeah
it
okay
i think i think um
it's probably a different setting for everybody
yes
at home
right right sure it's different how the children would
um it's hard to tell
yeah
somebody just you know
i'm not paying attention when i read because i want people to feel comfortable but
um
usually i mean it's normal of what they do play they with uh i guess every kid is interested in a different toy
you know
yep
so the um
the tower building and
things like that usually
the bottle
parents only go first for the animal
uh huh
yeah
you all done with your with your bottle there wills
uhoh
uhoh
okay
okay we gotta say bye to miss sabrina oh we've been still videotaping
that's okay
okay
huh
you see
you can play
i think i'll talk to your mom
talk to your mom
yeah that's her
that's right that's your mom
well um i don't know how long ago it was that you came for the second visit but
it was like a month
okay so maybe there have been some changes i dunno
that you noticed with what he likes to play with or how he's playing with toys
um
i'm not going to write this down
just gonna capture it
i think um he's starting to learn what things are a little bit more
so you know he might've known that this kind of stuff is food i dunno
um we don't have any toys like this at home
any of the food toys
so it's different for him
okay any of the or dishes or anything like that okay
i mean he plays when we're in the kitchen he plays with the spoons and the spatulas and
but uh otherwise we don't have any of the play foods so that's sorta new to him
okay so he did he seem to like that a lot
yeah i mean i would point out the animals and he didn't even seem to care about those as much
you like th the food and everything
did he have any favorite foods
he kept grabbing the uh
the pizza and the hamburger he kept going for
he did
he really liked that pizza
but it doesn't look so much like a real thing do you think he
i don't think he thinks i i don't know that he would know that it's real pizza
i mean all he's ever had is a crust with pizza anyways
so he's never really seen it
um
for some reason he liked it
why do you think he liked those
hamburger and pizza
um i dunno he's always liked things that are red in color
oh
i dunno if that has anything to do with it that's a complete guess
um because then this is sorta boring looking in comparison so
but he liked that
he liked it he was holding on to this like the whole time
wow okay
um let's see
so would you say the food interested him the most of all the toys
definitely yeah
where you going alex
which things do you think interested him the least
um
you can go find your car
i think the books
he likes books at home but usually it's when he's quiet
and we're sitting
and napping
so for him that was just too slow
okay
so he wasn't as interested
um he definitely seemed to be interested in the baby
but then as soon as you brought it over he was you know
he thought it was neat
but uh
he noticed it or something
he definitely noticed it
you noticed the baby interesting
yeah
but maybe doesn't know how to play with it
hi
that's interesting
a lot of kids seem to be interested in the facial features of the baby
where's the nose
where's the nose
where's the nose
yeah
how about any of these
he definitely he he remembered this from last time
and that's completely because of the the head
i think he loves loves this texture
okay
so um this he recognized and this he loved
mom says you like that
bee
bee
were there i i um i think i heard animal names and sounds but i wasn't sure if they were these animals i
um i mean i did a horse sound and a doggy sound
and then you know we did all the sounds in this
oh in that maybe that was what i was
those are farm ones
and so he knows all the farm animals he knows his rubber duckie at ho
does he make the noises yet
no no
but uh he definitely knows when he takes his bath he knows his rubber duckies
and he has this little crab
and if i say where's the crab he gives me the crab
so he knows what they are
so he knows what that means interesting okay
uh huh and you pair the sound with the animal
yeah yeah
so i do it often
so he would pick up on it
um and i asked you about differences from last time
no over here
they all like that
i'll have to get a different system for when they get older like you
hey what did i say no
you can play over here
oh that feels goo
that feels really good
do you think overall he prefers toys or books at this point
um at this point toys
okay alright
and do you know what um qualities about toys you would say that attract hi attract him
you mentioned color
i think the texture is probably bigger than anything
um because he likes to put things in his mouth
you know so he was holding the things that are softer
ah
versus
versus really hard
yeah he wasn't as much
i mean that's a guess
uh he has lots of blocks at home so i was sorta doing blocks with that
you're smiling about that
and do you have any dolls at home
um you know they're all not baby dolls they're animals
so there's like a big puppy big bear but actually no baby dolls
so maybe that was a little it's a little different from what he's used to
okay and
no we fed alex
oh oh
he fed himself
so he liked drinking from this
except he i think he was disappointed there was no water in it
and uh he ate with a spoon
oh he did very nice
well sort of
he pretended right
um so do you think he recognizes any of the any of the object names for any of these yet
of what's here i think he might have recognized this
uh when i called it do you want a drink do you want water
i don't use the term cup very often actually
so he definitely recognized that
um he might've recognized spoon
but i'm not sure
um
it seems like you played with a variety of things though
um you got around to atl at least offering most of these kinds of toys
that's great
that is great
um i think that's all i need to ask you at this point
um unless there's anything you noticed that you thought was kind of interesting for us to know um
um i don't think so
i thought it was odd how he was sitting still the whole time at home he never sits still
he's always all over the place
yeah he was right in that frame the whole time
yeah i said oh you want to see the bee and he just sort of stared
he didn't really go for it
so
now
okay well i think that's all i need
okay
and then you're going to come back at when he's two
big difference yeah
um so have you noticed any changes in the toys that she's been playing with here
since last week
um
no not not really
um probably since last week i have tr tried to be more purposeful at home
because its it like made me aware that i that she's she's not doing too much like pretend play yet
but um but shh you know she just kinda explores stuff
rather than doing too much meaningful play situations
can i have those
oh two thank you
she has been giving me stuff more lately
and she's definitely um she definitely gets angrier when she's not allowed to do what she wants
whether it be with a toy or not
lately
um so out of the toys that we have here which ones do you think she was most interested in
um the clock
i could see that
um what about the food items
do you think she liked those
um
yeah i think i think she likes plastic toys a lot
you know um one's that she can put in her mouth
yeah i see her eating a lot
um one's that make noise
right
yeah yummy
oh
um and definitel she's definitely not really too into stuffed animals or or dolls at home really either
um you know brief brief interactions at best
okay um i noticed that you were trying to read a book
um is that something you do at home
but i i really only have success if it's like before she falls asleep and we're in like a rocking chair and i'm not like there's no other toys around
she's she's not really into when there's other options going on
gentle gentle
that's mommy's
um do you think do you have any similar books at home
um we don't have any of these specific books
but we do have like we have some of this series and we have a couple board books
we have the b the books she likes the best when she does like books are the ones that have the sensory um piece to them
and like we have her books but not this specific book
and uh and i pretty much only do like li li lift the flap or um the touch and feel books with her
those are the ones she has the most attention for
do you think there are any items here that she would recognize the names of
um
maybe cup
i i i kinda thought she would she would recognize the bottle
not she doesn't take bottles but we babysit another baby who takes bottles
so i thought she might she might know bottle
um and spoon
but pretty much the
and and cookie
spoon
cookie
bottle
are the ones that i would th she had the most she would r re identify most easily but i'm not sure she would
um well shh we were here last week
and i think they were all the same
i think
oh yeah definitely
we don't have like we don't have that whole sandwich kit
our our pizza is different
ice she's never she doesn't see in real life
or war toys
um so yeah
this stuff here is different yeah
do you have pretend food at home
yeah
and she likes it
um she likes best to like take it
we have a little kitchen
she likes best to see what's in the pot and dump it all out
you know she's still like into dumping
okay um is there anything else you'd like to tell us about her playing
at here or at home
um nothing really too new
shh she really wants um someone to play with her a lot of the times now
and that's pretty new in the past few months
and if her sister is playing somewhere in the same room she'll go there
no matter what she's playing with that's where she wants to be
so i think she's i think she's looking for you know interaction more
no no no
she has been mouthing less since she started walking about a month ago
um but with new things
and with things she knows that are typically mouthed
she puts it right in her mouth
you're so funny
is that good
yeah
alright well then i think we're all done here
okay
so first of all what do you think has changed since last time
um i think she is getting a little bit better at like some of the pretend play i mean like feeding the fact that she fed the baby that's the first time i've seen her do that
that was that was pretty impressive
um i think her receptive language has improved a little bit since last time
so you think she knows some of the words you were talking about
yeah well i think just understanding like i don't know i guess just like you know give the you know give it to the baby or you know whatever i mean she just i don't know obviously she probably wouldn't understand all those words but
understood the ideas behind it some more
so still a lot of these things are foreign to her i mean she has eaten peas finally but i don't know that i've labeled them for her
so
yeah yeah
yeah is the baby eating
that's her sign for eat
hi baby
yeah
is there anything else here that you would think that she particularly recognize from being from having at home
i mean the pretend food we don't have at all um
and like i mean the only food like the cup like she has a cup and we don't drink juice but she has a cup and she drinks that a lot more now so
that was probably more familiar and we do read good night moon so even though this was a different version she i think she recognized some parts of it and she definitely showed a lot more interest in the pages that looked like
the copy that we have than the ones where it was like counting and she definitely didn't seem interested in those ones
it's a book
book
and the pages that looked like in the book she was more interested in those um
and puppy i mean she knows and i think she she knew that one last time too
she's known that one for awhile
um i dunno i mean she's everytime we come she loves the pretend food and we still don't have any pretend food but i feel like that's something that we definitely probably need to get her at some point soon
cause she does seem to show a pretty good interest in it although i think most of it is just teething and mouthing
well you know i can be shaped into good play
um i noticed you were doing a lot of body parts
is that something you've been working on
just recently yeah we i've been trying to start getting her especially the facial ones like eyes nose mouth
trying to get her to to recognize some of those i mean i don't i don't think she knows them yet but i mean i think she's starting to be more familiar with the words
hearing me say them
cause like when i say oh look it's so and so's eyes
she tends to look to see what i'm pointing at so
maybe she knows it but i think she's just starting to be familiar with the word but not necessarily knowing what it means
you have a cup
and spoons um she she has we've attached some measuring spoons so whenever she eats she gets to play with those so that's a familiar toy which i don't think she had last time
so yeah yeah you get to play with your spoons huh
yeah spoons
hi baby hi baby
of all the stuffed animals picked out three in particular
the puppies and the frog cause she seemed to love frogs i mean we have a couple different frog things at home and she seems to and just this last week she started cause i try to do some science and for a frog
and just this last week she started when i talk about frogs she'll stick her tongue out she didn't do it this time but it's a frog
you see the frog
yeah and we do sing that little song usually whenever we see a frog so she likes that
like that can you do
no
your going to say it but you aren't going to do the tongue now but she does she does
where she's i think she's
frog yeah
yay yeah frog
and then puppies like i said she knows and like so and she has stuffed animals of puppies too so
you have do you have a dog at home
yes we do have a dog at home
yeah yeah we do have a cat at home too but she doesn't like i think she started like sometimes she'll imitate like kitty an approximation of the word for me but puppy she's definitely more interested in the dog than the cat
she likes to yell at him actually just like she yelled at the puppy dog the the stuffed animals
you love your puppy
your puppy
yeah your puppy
that's not a puppy that's a frog
yeah it's a puppy
so you said that the spoons were something that you newly you've gotten since like the last time that you were here as a toy is there anything else that's a new toy
um i don't think so you know not similar to what you have here
i don't think so
are you hiding oh i see you i see you
well i think that is it um
so this was the third visit
the final one
for this period in your life um
um and um yeah when she gets closer to two years um
that's when we will start looking to see whether any of these different things that these different skills relate to how she's learned
what she you know what kind of vocabulary she has and she developed over
over time um
yeah
although probably not big for a two year old cause she still seems to be she stays small for her age
tall but skinny
yeah it's true
my brother was the chubbiest baby ever he was so fat he just had rolls upon his rolls and yet
he's one of the skinniest adults
what do you see the frog
frog
yeah
yeah you do you making music with them
yeah
wanna clean up the toys
yeah haha
okay i'm just gonna ask you to clip that back onto your sweater
okay
um i'm just gonna ask you i'm sure you've been asked these questions before
but ah i just thought i would ask them again
you're making a mess kiddo
there's the bins
let's put the toys in the bin
let's put the toys in the bins
bye bye drooly bumble
yeah
let's put the toys in the bins
no put the toys in the bin
in the bin
come here aj
put it in
over here
put in
put in
put in
here you go put it in
yeah
thank you
ah byebye toys
i know this part's not fun
wanna look at this while i talk to your mom
haha
okay so um just a few questions for you
i'm sure you've been asked these before
um but um so my first question would be have you have there been any changes since like the last visit or so last since like maybe the first or the second visit maybe in terms of what toys he likes to play with or what games he likes to play with
um he's definitely expanded not from the second to the third visit it was last week
but from his first to second visit he plays with a lot more toys now and a lot more actively with toys
um he used to play with just like rattles and stuff
and now he's into like block and and everything
come here monster come here monster
let's go over here
come over here
go get him
haha
go get it
and he's a lot more active now than he was at seven or eight months
he's a lot more mobile
okay so which toys do you think that he was the most interested in this visit
this visit was probably this book
um and the little bumble
he's traditionally liked the bumble
thank you
thank you
although he does like um he played with the food toys not necessarily they were food toys he likes blocks a lot
so i think it was things he could throw around pretty easily
he likes to do that
okay
yeah
haha does he like animals a lot
no i mean we've had this book at home
and he doesn't care for it so
this is the first it's a pretty similar book
and so th that's new
does he like ducks
no haha
haha okay
i think he likes the texture of that bumble stuffed toy
he always has since he started coming but
no that's the first time he's really played with that
and my husband tries to read it to him like every night this and other books
and he could care less
haha which ones do you think interested him the least in terms of the toys that were here this visit
um still not into like doll babies or anything like that
um and then he's not really interested in stuffed toys too much anymore
why do you think that might be he's not interested in that
i don't think they're um like when he throws or moves a block around it makes a noise and it
when he swee moves a stuffed toy around it usually doesn't squeak or make noise
he's interested in things that like can bang together and and make noise
or like when we're home we often stack
and he knocks it down
stuffed toys aren't as noisy or interactive yeah
okay
and he doesn't really have like a security blanket or anything yet so
there's nothing he's particularly attached to
and out of the books which book would you prefer that he would look at with you
um i mean this one's cool it's got the textures and the
now i didn't re actually read it to him
but it's um the ones that we have at home he we read to him
and he's bored
so we but we always tell him the dog you know the doggie and the kitty and the you know and and encourage him to touch it
so these are these are hits usually
okay and do you think there are any items that you think your child recognizes the name of
are there any items
probably not
we don't have any of these at home so
little boy
okay
do you think um there are any items that he's never seen or heard of before
um i mean the a lot of the food items were very blocklike
but he probably hasn't seen like i don't think i've ever said to him spaghetti
but he's eaten spaghetti
he just wouldn't know what that was
um i don't think except for here he's ever played with like a doll baby too much
um he's had stuffed toys and um and other stuff though
you have a few of these toys kind of like like like at home
you said you have some of these books
yeah we have books and blocks and um stuffed we do have some stuffed things
okay and do you think he prefers books or toys
toys
i mean when he plays with books it's because it's toylike
it's not like he's reading it
its he can th especially the small ones he kind of just opens it and goes back and forth because it
so it's something to play with not because it's got words in it
he could care less
what did you get little boy
and so you said he doesn't like to play with it you don't play with it but the dolls and the pretend food and things like that
no
do you think that he might have recognized any of the play food
i know you said the spaghetti would probably
yeah well last not that he eats a lot of cookies or any really
but last time i kept saying cookie
and he seemed to really like that one
i don't think he recognized anything it's i mean most of th what he gets is like not anything like that
i mean maybe the bread
but probably not since we never give him a piece of bread
we give him pieces of anything
uhoh
yay
okay then i think that's it
hey alden
aj
haha
we will let him keep playing and um you can tell me what you think he likes
and what he is interested in today
i know he was here a short time ago so it might not be too much different
um
i think he likes like food he recognizes
well do you think he recognizes any of the stuff that we have
um well i think that he recognizes more stuff now that he's been here a couple times
um like you know i think that he'll like recognize the pizza and ice cream
although like you know our pizza doesn't look like this whenever he sees it
a little bit bigger and
well no i like cut it up for him so all of a sudden its like pieces
or yeah exactly
its like a big slice
and he never receives an ice cream cone
except for here
except for here
and i think this is spaghetti and sauce but
it doesn't look like any spaghetti we have
so
so i'm reluctant to call it spaghetti because then when i give him spaghetti that's like whole wheat and like strands in a bowl he just
um
and these i just think are the funniest things
like i don't know how you can call this peas
because its a boo its a its a block
right
and its just a box
so
its supposed to be frozen huh
i guess
i never had too much of a look at that
and peas
i guess but a baby never encounters food like
like in a box
would not encounter food that way
especially like peas
no
right
right
yes
they don't
so i think these are very funky
you know its more fun to play with this block
oh yeah
yeah
and he likes the
and he loves babies at home
he loves babies
he loves books
oh yeah that's right he liked the books
you did didn't you
yes and he loves spoons
obviously he likes to eat
and he looked at the juice
juice cans
yes
yes
right
is this your cup
you going to drink
yum
i like how you pretend with him
even though you're both like
he's so cute
he's the cutest
he's so in to it
ice cream
more
more ice cream
um
there's not to i mean you were here very recently so would you says there's any changes that you've noticed
yes
he's been doing a lot of signs in the past couple of a lot a lot of signs i should say a lot of signs
he's been doing a lot more signing
so like he's been doing more a lot
so more consistently
yes
and then if you count the good kisses
so that's a big change
in the last couple of weeks
yes a lot of change
and he'll also i think he we think he says up
but maybe its our imagination
that whenever he's down and we're up he says
up up up
are you kissing now
but yes it seems like he's really communicating a lot more in the past couple of weeks
so its really cute
yes
so
its all tied in
are you kissing
i don't even like at the playground more like he'll go down the slide and then he'll immediately sign
more more
that's probably that's probably enough anyway
heehee
talk about the toys he liked or didn't like
sure
that kind of stuff
i think we have enough of you guys playing together
okay
aw
you gonna show judy the bee
you're almost carrying it like a a doll maybe
yeah he he doesn't have a lot of um a whole lot of stuffed animals i guess
he has a few
but this is a new things where he gets really excited
and it's like straining to be excited
it's very funny
yeah
yeah um so there he goes
that's why it's it's kind of strange to play with him in in this setting to see what he wants
because we're so active and we do a lot of like chasing around the house and
ahhah different kind of playing
yeah
um so he does play with toys
don't get me wrong
but um it's much more physical
yeah
in a way
sitting and playing quietly is really not what you do at home
no
but you said he does
but he does
he does do that like with in some independent play
he has blocks at home
and we will build towers
and he tends to knock them down
which was why i was surprised that he didn't knock it over right away
um he doesn't have a baby doll
so um and obviously he's an only child
he doesn't have
a baby
a baby
not that we know about
and um so i mean he likes s he it's kind of funny how he fixated on that bottle
he doesn't use a bottle
ever
i mean well not ever
but um he i breast him
and then he drinks from a glass
um he doesn't even really use a sippy
we tried
but he just focuses on it kind of like that
so it d is not very helpful
right that's interesting
so are you saying so he spent a lot of with the bottle
yeah
okay you liked the bottle
he liked the bottle
and he seemed to like that pile of spaghetti
ah which is
somewhere around here
it's over here
oh okay
but i don't know
was there anything different from last time
i'll sit over there
no sweetie don't do that
was there anything that you think he he was interested in this time that he wasn't interested in last time
i don't
no chords
i don't remember what he did last time
um i think i think i feel like last time he was more into the books
than the plastic food stuff
um but this time it seemed to be you know what he's doing
although it might also be because he's teething
yeah i saw that it looked like he has some new ones coming in
yeah he got ah these two
and now he's got another one coming in at the bottom
and i think he's got a couple more that are poking through
so is that what you think is going on with the some of the hard things
that's what i think
and that's why maybe the bottle was really appealing it's got a hard nipple thing on it
right that makes sense
he was but he liked a little bit of the stuffed animal play
ah yeah
i mean i think that he ah you know he likes that
where'd that bee thing go
he likes this because i think he likes the rubber part of it with
and
yeah
it's exciting
and you read a little bit
um a little bit
we have this type of book at home
but he didn't seem to be all that interested in it
what he recently he has decided that he likes books
but only to be excited about the book
and bringing it to you to read
but then he doesn't have the attention span to actually sit there and read it
okay
um but he has some favorite books
we have
yeah
big box of books
and i'll say
go get me olivia
and he'll go and pick out the book
like so he knows
his favorite is the pokey little puppy
which i understand why he doesn't wanna sit through it
it's very long
but um he loves it
and he will um get it um every time
like on many occasions
that's his favorite it's clear that's his favorite
yeah
but we have no idea why
he never reads it
well you guys are a little bit mysterious huh
yeah
you young guys
we don't know exactly what's going on
we don't really get any clearer as they get older
so um what did you think so thought that this kind of stuff was his favorite today
i think so yeah
i think that that seemed um to be a preference
and you liked the bottle and spaghetti
yup
and those were the two main ones that he liked this time
yeah and this bee thing
the bee yeah
i mean obvi this is more his usual mode of play
where he gets up
and he tries to get in things
and he's running around
and he's kind of crazy
quiet playing was kind of interesting to me even because he doesn't usually do that haha
yeah well as they get more mobile i guess that's get around like that
yeah
getting around like that
right
um oh you said something about this one
oh um he has um at my mom's house he has a white there's a white stuffed poodle
that we named nellie that was our white poodle's name when we had one
and ah he loves nellie
and he will as soon as he gets there go and get her and then pick her up
and so this is a pink nellie
and so this one
that's what you were saying pink nellie
you see the pink nellie
not interested
that's not anything like nellie huh
this one maybe more like nellie
what a chicken say
yeah he's doing it
so so do you think he prefers books or toys
oh um i've i think probably toys
although he looks at books as toys
like it's all part of the same thing
there's not a clear delineation that this is a book
and this is what you do with a book
he'll take the book
and he'll
does he get them out by himself
and l and does he turn pages
or is he sort of unloading more
um i would say unloading
and then he really wants ah to share it
and th that seems to
yeah
so and when you turn the pages he does try to turn the pages
but we only use the board books
because if there it's a real book he will rip the pages out so
and we've decided that we don't want him to continue to do that
so we took away all those books
so it's a little bit harder even for his
he's got pretty good coordination
to turn the pages of the book
yeah
he's pretty active huh
yeah
and you don't really have dolls at home
and um you have a few stuffed animals
he has a few
oh yeah he liked
the keys
he likes to make noise
so the um he plays in the kitchen with me while i'm um making dinner and stuff
so he likes the teaspoons
in fact i think i have one in my purse
um the measuring spoons and the um
i put them in the purple pitcher he likes to make noise
so we have a lot of things that have something else in it that shake
he likes that a lot
okay i remember now you did that
yeah
yeah
why are you sitting like that
move your foot
thank you
no y sitting huh
w i mean
w is
my ah mother in taught school in thailand
and she said all the kids did that
and it's just so terrible for their hip development and their knees so
and i didn't even know it
i mean i was like he's so flexible
i figured he can do whatever
but she was like he shouldn't do that
they tend to do it to get some trunk support
its more
yeah exactly
and with that big belly you need some extra help don't you
let's see
was there anything that you noticed
or that you have noticed since the last visit that has changed or that you think is interesting
um well i mean ah he has gotten a lot more excited
ahhah than you said
yeah
can you fit that whole thing in your mouth
or you gonna come you gonna come get it
give it to me
be careful that's kind of pokey
if you fall down it might hurt you
um um i i think that he again it's hard to i mean if i saw what he did last time i could probably s say what more of his um changes were
but at home i i guess um he d he has gotten a lot more deliberate in his play
and more interactive
so you know that he will bring more things to you
or you know if i if i do build things he will um kind of yeah take them down
he hasn't gotten to the point where he puts them away
we tried to teach him the putting away game
but he i think he's on to us already
he's too smart
he's too smart about the cleaning up
it was interesting the way he took that tower down one by one
that's new actually
he used to just kno
we call him joezilla
he'd just knock everything over
but he has again gotten a little bit more deliberate with things so
interesting
yeah and i had a
i'm surprised he could do it
he's pretty he's got a lot of mo mo um fine motor coordination
which means that he's eating lint and other small things that he can find on the floor
old peas
i'm like oh i really gotta be a better house cleaner now
um so oops i forgot
um so so that's kind of a change too
and that he he's really gotten into the chasing games
like i will just chase him around the house
and then he'll chase me
um so that's kind of a new thing
yeah
and we have balls
he loves balls
so we have a football
and we have a baseball
and which is just the ball at our house
and then we have a new ball that's for outside play
and at my mom's house he has two balls
and he loves them
loves 
and he he's he picks them up
and he does this thing with his hands i guess that my husband and i did that a lot
like you know how you hit the ball before you throw the football kind of thing
so he does that and then
those are not for you okay
let's leave those here
let's leave them in here
and then um he um is k starting to get into kicking
wow
wow
but he loves he loves ba
and th th there's a like one of those plastic balls that you get at ah giant
that's great
sweetie don't break it
we need to throw that away
not a good toy for this
um but he w ah i bought one
and we took it outside yesterday
and h it's in his stroller
and he keeps trying to get it out
he can't get it out
it's too big
it's in there
but he's like i want this
really attracted to balls
yeah yeah
alright well would've been interesting if we had one here
oh yeah yeah
my guess is that that would've been
a favorite
yeah
i mean i'm
she's on to you
she's knows
so i have the same round of questions
okay
that i have to read as last time
um one of the first things we like to ask is do you notice if you remember what she played with last time
if you r um did you notice any changes
um i think shh i think she might have remembered some of these
um because i could just tell by her reactions
yeah
yeah it seemed like especially the bee
um but maybe she was a little more um maybe she was like a little f familiar with the area and the toys
like she she was like going out and grabbing them on her own
um whereas before i was like handing them to her i think
were there any specific ones that you found she played with now and not last time
last time
ah no i don't think so
i remember last time she played with the animals and the food
and that seemed to be what she was interested in this time also
although actually she was the spoons and the keys
i don't know if the spoons were here last time
but the keys were here last time
and she was having a lot more fun with these today
ah how books here and at home
she's not she her attention span isn't really um
we have trouble getting through a full book with her
okay
so
um yeah i could tell
i think books were at the bottom of her list today
there's just too much other stuff for her to look at
i'm sorry do you have any of the books at home
these books
yeah we do
we do have some of these books
but i don't know if she's ever
i don't think we've gone over these books these particular ones with her
with her sister we have
but um yeah i don't think we don't have any of these exact ones
that that we've gone over with her
like her her books generally are um like
these are a little bit more advanced
i don't know her books the ones we do at have at home are like four pages long
the inflatable or like the touching
um yeah we have an inflatable one that she likes
but they're also cardboard
just like real quick with you know like an animal on each page or something
um not where you have to word read multiple words
she that's when she starts to lose her um lose focus on the book
do you think um she'd recognize any of the names of the animals today
ah maybe
she knows i i think she kind of knows dog
because we have our dog
um and like the like woof woof
she knows to associate with with the dog
um but i think she remembered the bee
for sure
um but i don't know about like names of the animals
maybe the bee
probably more the sounds though that i make with him
yeah
i was doing that with her last time
she seemed to remember that
and i um noticed that a couple times rather than saying dog you used either the type of dog or a dog name
oh yeah the dog's name
yeah our dog's name tasmin
so that's i've been going over like tasmin's a dog
and he says woof woof
so i was trying to get her to kind of although um
yeah
tasmin doesn't look like either of these dogs
but my parents
who she sees my parents a few times a week
they have a poodle
not a pink poodle but haha
um named frio
so i was thinking maybe she'd get get that out of this
but i don't know
probably not
so and the bear
the bear
yeah she um i don't know if she really knows who winnie the is
but she's we went to disneyworld in march
and we saw lots of winnie the there
but i doubt if she remembers that
do you have stuffed animals at home
yeah
lots of animals at home
how do you usually play with them at home
um same thing
just like having like you know rubbing them against her and ticking her
so shh she's a big fan of the stuffed animals and hugging them
and um the play food that seemed to be
yeah
the play food she'll just want to eat
she really likes to eat
so anything that looks like cooking food she's going to test it out
ah so i think she doesn't you know doesn't know the difference between pretend food and real food
um but pretty much the food we feed her at home is cut up into small pieces
so i don't think she would make the association between what she's eaten and the play food
that makes sense
are is there anything that would be
i know last time you said she loves everything
is there a favorite food here
honestly she would eat any of this
ah she does like noodles
either noodles or cheese
would probably be out of what's here would probably be her favorite
although she'd quickly eat up anything else
you said you didn't have play food at home
yeah we do
how do you play with that usually
ah well it's pretty much just in her sister's play kitchen
she'll just go over to the kitchen and pull it out and chew on it
and so we don't really yeah we don't really play with her with the food
she just kind of gets it out herself
you use it to like feed the animals or
oh yeah
ah she does
i don't know if she really understood that
she does like to take whatever she's eating and put it to my mouth
and she likes me to pretend that i'm eating her food
well she thinks i'm eating it but
okay isabelle off the chords
your favorite thing here
yeah oh what is that
speaking of that what do you think was her favorite thing today
either the bee or the dogs
those seemed to really entertain her for a while
just had lots of hugs for the for the dogs
i think she likes the texture of this
it's like a different rubbery texture
oh that's good
do you think that gets her a lot
like a book or something
textures
yeah
defin yeah the textures and also the colors
i think this has some you know bright colors and contrast to it
and the sounds
yeah definitely yeah sounds
absolutely
and i feel like she knew what to do with the spoon
she was putting that right in her mouth
although you know we'll give her we'll feed her
but we'll give her a spoon to play with
and she tries to pick up the food and with the spoon and put it in her mouth
okay and do you think
you said you think she recognized the bee but um
i think i may have asked this
but do you think she would recognize the names
as in if you said it out loud she would look at it or know what you're talking about
maybe the dogs
oh isabelle
um i think maybe dogs she would she might do the association
but i don't think anything else she would really
i mean i guess shh she's heard the words before
but i don't think she could put two and two together
what do you think is the least is the thing she liked the least
probably the baby doll
yeah isabelle
isabelle
that's yeah i know
come on
and how do you usually deal with you know if she gets is disinterested in something
how do you get her to come back to you
to get back to that
um usually have to like pick her up
and you know whatever she's
yeah just kind of like pick her up and
you're okay
put her in a new environment almost
so she can't see
i know
you can see it
i know
you can see it
so you wanna go right for it
i know
i know you love the chords
okay
okay
alright well i think she's ready
oh boy yeah
oh no
come on
come on sweetie
oh boy
okay
so vocal
yeah haha come on mom
yeah at some point
some point we'll get there
okay
what do you think he enjoyed the most today
ah the fake bottles
the little juice cup and the little bottle
is that usually something does he do you have that kind of food at home
we do
we've got a little pretend kitchen set
and he and his sister spend a lot of time playing at it
and playing with the food
so some of these things we have at home
ah what which ones do you have
we have the ice cone
we have pasta that looks similar to that
and the peas
um and have a one fake bottle
but it's a fake milk bottle
um we don't have big wooden ones like this
i think he liked the weight of them
he liked playing with the peanut jar
no he doesn't stack so much yet
he likes to knock things down when i stack them
or especially if his sister stacks them
she likes stacking
he likes knocking down
they make a good pair
um today was actually the first time that i'd seen him take something gently from the top of the stack instead of just knocking the whole thing over
normally he just likes to go kaboom with them
but today he actually picked something up off the top
do you do you think there are any food items names that he recognizes
um
well yeah he i mean he probably recognizes peas because we both eat peas and have toy peas at home
um don't really eat peanut
um and the kids don't really have much juice
but i think he probably just from the playing recognizes it
his sister does drink juice
he does not
so he may recognize that word as something that he's not normally allowed to have
like no that's sabrina's juice
um he's also teething
it could just be that he likes gnawing on them because it hits some of the back tee or you know some of the back gums
hey hey baby
what do you think he liked the least today
the stuffed animals
every time
he just doesn't care about them
like i i don't know if he's played with them at all when he's been here
and we have stuffed animals at home
and he rarely
unless they have like something jingly inside them
he doesn't he just doesn't care about them
do you think he knows like any of the animal
um he might
um maybe more regular ones like just dog and cat and stuff
he might recognize some of those
but he just doesn't really like playing with stuffed animals
ah how the books was that a big success today or
ah he's generally sort of luke warm about books
um he doesn't he'll listen i'll read to him when i'm nursing him
and he'll listen
and sometimes like when i'm burping i'll keep reading to him
um but we don't he doesn't really have the patience to sit and listen to the word books at this point in time
he'd rather chew on them
or if he can get his hands on paper books he likes to try and pull the paper because it makes paper
he loves noise
um
yeah
yeah
you do
um so his interest in the books here is about his interest in the books at home
um if i'm reading to his sister he likes to be on my lap too
and we'll all read together
that is not for you
he loves wires
loves wires
if you had a pile of wires and electronics remotes you know cameras iphones anything like that that's what he would would play with
ah which books do you did you read today
um we did put me in the zoo
and what was the other
oh we looked at the farm one
he does have a touchy um book on um like vehicles
trucks and stuff
that he likes to like to read
that entertain him when he's in the car
um so i think you know he guess he likes the the feeling of them
and put me in the zoo he just picked up and handed to me
we don't have this one at home
we've read it before
but we don't have it at home
yeah
go ahead
i'm sorry
i was just gonna ask
what so um just to get the gist of it
what do you think that um everything that he liked today had in common
hard stuff that he could chew on
hard or hardish
he likes the textures
and he likes things that make noise
so we were it's actually it was an idea i got last time when we were here
there was already the little cookie in here
and he liked rattling it back and forth
and so we spent some time putting you know things
and once i put the first thing in he followed my direction and was putting more stuff in
um but he liked the rattling
um you know rattling this stuff
and i guess the touch of the the books
you keep grabbing the pizza
oh
is that the most typical thing that he
we don't have this at home
but at our play group there's a
it looks exactly like this just bigger
piece of pizza
it's the thing that that they all fight over
there's only one piece
i'm sure that there were more at some point in time
and kids probably walked off with the other pieces
i don't know what is so fascinating about it
but he was playing with the pizza
and every time he picked up some
thank you
would you like it back
you cannot have the wire
um so no i don't know what's fas
maybe it's the texture
um but he was playing with it a lot
and um yeah it's a big favorite at play group too
ah how the baby doll
we have a couple baby dolls at home
they are his sister's baby dolls
he occasionally expresses interest in them
mainly when she is trying to play with them
he doesn't really look at them when he's on his own
or when she's not around
um so um i was trying to see if he would look at it and be like
oh look it's a baby doll
you can play with it and feed it and stuff like that
are you upside down
he likes being upside down
he'll crawl and put his head on the ground and try and try and do a somersault
likes being upside down
into climbing on everything
yeah the daredevil
yeah very physical
does he play with his sister with the the baby doll
it's generally trying to grab the baby doll and chew on her face
or you know i think it's just it's it's plastic
it's it's not real hard
you know probably felt good against his gums
and it gives the added benefit of ah teasing her she's trying to play with it
um yeah
that's entertainment most days is them figuring out how to annoy the other one
were there any differences on how he played here today and how he plays at home
um not a lot
at home we have more um cars and trucks
he likes he likes those a lot
and things with wheels that he can move
and we also have um a lot of little people figures
like the fisherprice little people
and he likes playing with those
ah but it's yeah trucks and little people he likes a lot
um the f so you guys don't have them here
you know he might have played with them
but yeah he doesn't have much interest in stuffed animals at home either
and interest in books
and you've got a new friend
careful stevie
do not pull hair
do not pull hair
be gentle
you've gotta be gentle
you do not know your own strength
good listening
look at you
that's sweet
how across the visits
do you remember
you said in common the stuffed animals
he's never really played with the stuffed animals
he's always sort of looked at the books
and has spent most of the time chewing on the food
i mean it's it's pretty much been the same each of our visits here
um and once or twice making a break for the wires
yeah
um yeah but it's it's been pretty common
it it's always been the the food that he's played with um the most
but that makes sense for how he plays at home as well
he likes likes playing with that stuff
and um one thing he didn't do today that he normally does at home is um
he's spent a lot of time lately taking two things and banging them against each other
or banging them on the table
like that seems to be his um entertainment of choice recently is the banging
um
trying to think
what else do you do at home
yeah
yeah it's strange because i don't honestly i don't see him play on his own all that often
because he and his sister are always playing together so that kind of changes the dynamic of things
because the two of them are interacting and either avoiding each other
or one of them is trying to take the other's things
either she's trying to take his stuff
or he's trying to take her stuff
and sometimes they trade back and forth and actually play w in the same space nicely
which is awesome
um and really cool to see
um but it's it's just there isn't much time that he doesn't have somebody else around him
either a play group or with his sister at home that's in the same general space playing with him
so that's i guess a difference of being here versus being at home as well
i was just thinking just having seen him react to you you know well definitely the no
do you think he knows the name book
he might he might know book
i'm not sure
he does know no
whether or not he chooses to mind me he knows no
he no you know there's he's got a handful of words that he definitely definitely knows
and the rest of them it's it's kind of amorphous as to
is it that he's responding to my t like when i said
oh hand me the book
and let me read it to you
he handed it to me
but is it because i said book
is it because i said hand it to me
is it because of my tone
or is it because my hand is out like this
and that's what he's holding
um he likes to share
he'll come over he'll crawl over to me and hand me something
and i'll take it and be like
oh thank you
and hand it back to him
and that makes him happy he's sharing
um i don't know if he knows the word book
he might
are there any um i don't know maybe any foods that
i guess it depends on what foods he's eating for him to have a level of excitement to eat it
um not really i mean it's a l we're still having a lot of junky baby food
i've been trying to we don't don't really get into the whole baby signing thing
um the two signs that i had learned were more and enough
and so when i've been feeding him i've been trying to go
okay do you want more
you want more
at which point his two and a half year old sister pipes up
i want more
i want more
like you already have your words
you don't need to do that
but today for the first time i was feeding him
and i was giving him some bits of hot for um at lunchtime which was unusual for him
and he kept going like this and going
and i tried giving him some cheerios which he also had
and he kind of threw them of his plate and kept going
and so i was like
do you want this
and he started shoveling another piece of hot into his mouth
so that was the first time that actually worked
it never worked with his sister
so now i think i might have to learn a few more to teach him
besides more
so i don't i don't think that he knows food names yet
other than you know
either he gets food or he doesn't
um we'll probably work on on water or milk
ah to try and really see if
the drinks are ah
sometimes i can't tell if he's thirsty or not
or he'll go and get in a big fight with his sister
and i find out it was because he was after her water bottle
and it's like oh yours was empty
i didn't realize that
other than yeah screams and cries
yes
um but yeah the the bulk of his words are you know
stop
come here
sister
mommy
daddy
we know that he r like
where's your sister
like he'll look around for sabrina
you know
but i don't know i just remember with his sister that it was at some point she was crawling around
and i was like
okay it's naptime
let's go upstairs
and i didn't gesture in any way
she just crawled to the stairs and started going upstairs
i don't remember how old she was at that point
but it was just like
wow how long had this been building that i was able to say this sentence to her
and she's nowhere near talking
but she understood and followed it
it's cool
they're cool
okay so let's see
so which of the toys did she seem most interested in this time
still the food
she still seemed to be maybe i need to be feeding her more before she comes here
she still went right to
um today she seemed to like that bottle a lot
and and the peas
okay and last time i can't remember i think
last time it was that yellow that yellow box which she still picked up today yeah
the cereal box
and um and last time she went for the keys and the the measuring spoons too
but um haha
what what did she seem
what are you doing
um she didn't even
touch that pile
look at that pile yeah
yeah she didn't even after i showed her the pooh bear
she didn't have any interest in that
does she have ah i can't remember any of these items at home that she plays with
um we do have i mean we definitely have books everywhere
and ah the kids have a play kitchen
they don't have a lot of food in it
they have more like dishes and things
haha look what you found
um and she's got a few stuffed animals and um
okay um
actually we have quite a few stuffed animals and dolls lying around the house too
but she has a few in her crib just like two or three of 
haha and she seemed interested
she did seem really interested in that clock
i don't know what it was about that
maybe the colors
the colors
yeah you like that one
she seemed to like touching these
so you think it's more like the rather than the animals it's more the the fact that it's
yeah she she was you know really touching the the textures yeah
yeah you were huh
is it soft
recognizes the names of any of these items
i don't know
i i'm having a really hard time telling if she really you know understands words
but she um like if i say something does she look for it or
um or does she seem to really know what it is
i'm not really sure if she does
okay does she have like a favorite toy at home that she knows the n
um
i think she knows bear
she has a little stuffed bear
and i think she knows bear
do you know bear
yeah
i'm going to switch the microphone over
yeah
haha ellie where's bear
where's bear
yeah
bear
i think she even said i'm not sure
but she seems to say
sometimes she says it more consistently
yeah usually if they have like a favorite toy that usually where they start
yeah
okay well i think we're done for today
i'm going to go get the basket for her to pick a toy to take home
okay
i can take that microphone
i'm just gonna ask you a few questions
okay
are you listening
i'm not gonna write anything down it's just gonna be recorded
okay
so which of the toys seemed to interest him the most
um the spoons
and the pizza
and the keys
what else nicholas
um what's the most would be yeah these little plastic
achoo
achoo
bless you
achoo
which is a good toy for his personality
um the spoons and the keys
because they make noise
yeah because they make noise
he likes to make noise
and he likes to shake
right
shake shake shake
okay
and you already said why you think it interested him
which of the toys seemed to interest him the least
um the doll didn't interest him at all
um the books so so
and i guess the stuffed animals too except for a couple of them
yup
why do you think that is
um
are you smiling
saying hi
um the stuffed animals don't make noise when you shake 
um i don't know with the baby
i don't know
i guess because it wasn't you know maybe because it wasn't a small hand held toy that he could tap and rattle
i think that's why
do you think there are any items that his interests in have changed since the last time you were here
do you remember what he played with last time
yeah last time he played with most the plas the pizza
he chewed on the pizza
um no the interest was about the same
the same m mostly interested in the plastic toys
which book do you think he would prefer to read or look at with you
um probably the the baby one the peekaboo baby
um yeah the other ones are
yeah the peekaboo one
okay
do you think it's because that one's like more interactive
yeah it's interactive
it has baby faces
um yeah these have smaller pictures and
um i think it's may a little older
does he play with any similar toys at home
yes
he plays with um
yeah he does
i don't know if you want me to say what kind of toys or
um he's got jingle bells that he rings
little maracas
um yes
what else
um what else do you play with at home
nicholas
he
i'm sorry
what was the question again
if he has any similar toys
yeah the similar ones
yeah he has like little hand held toys that make noise like this
do you think he prefers books or toys in general
toys
does he ever play with any dolls at home
um not as much as he used to no
occasionally
we have some at home he has an older sister
um he plays with like the little people
i don't know if you consider those really a doll
but like the the doll babies not as much anymore
okay
do you ever play with pretend food or pretend to feed any dolls at home
um yes we have pretend food
he plays with those
but he doesn't pretend to eat 
he he chews on them
or he he likes to throw them and bounce them
where are you going
psst
um do we pretend to feed
no
okay
do you think he recognized any of the foods from last time or at home
from last time
i think he remembered the pizza
that was the first thing he picked up this time and last time
okay
at this point do you think he recognizes the names of any of the items or is beginning to
you mean these that are here
yeah
um
or any items that aren't here as well
um ball
i think he's recognizing that
um and cars
here
i don't think so
he knows birdie
okay
he likes that bee this time
that one's
you like that bee
it's pretty cool
last time he i showed it to him he didn't really want to play with it
you like it
can you shake it
you silly
okay that's it
okay
all done
okay over there
yeah he's fine
um
be careful mister
yeah he's
um were there which group of toys did he seem to like
the food
the food
yeah
oh okay
what about the least
um the stuffed animals
okay
and i don't know if you remember
but do you think that changed
the last time he also liked the toys
and i
or the food
and i think it has to do with the fact that it's the most um the easiest for him to chew on he's teething like he was last time
so the last time he chose the pea
like i just think the shape of them
it's easy for him to hold and to gnaw on
i know he doesn't know what spaghetti
i mean i'm pretty sure he doesn't know what spaghetti is
he's never had spaghetti so
okay
ah did he did he go to the books at all
he didn't
um i mean i tried to read them to him
i think
at home he tends to we read a lot
um i've been surprised that when we're here he's not interested in the books
but it might just be because there's other toys here that he's not familiar with
um do you guys have any of these at home
we have um we have the put me in the zoo
and we have no we don't have we have the regular good night moon
not good night moon one two three
this book um grammy h grandma has at her house
so
um does he have similar toys at home
um he h i mean he has books
he has stuffed animals
he doesn't have any food toys
okay
um no
okay
um
although the one thing i was surprised by was that he picked this up and tried to drink outta it
we're we're transitioning him to a bottle at night before bed
and so he it took him a long time to get adjusted to that
but now he obviously knows what it is because he was trying to get the liquid out haha
okay haha
um so you said he l
what do ya doing
toys or books that ah he likes
at home i would say he'd prefers his toys
um i mean we generally use books kind of as a wind thing before naptime or bedtime
what do ya doing with the peas
i think you said he doesn't know what spaghetti he never had spaghetti before
no no
would he recognize any of the other foods
i mean i'm not sure when when he gets peas we give them like th we give him like three or four peas at a time
and that's not really what this looks like
so i'm not k completely sure
he eats cheese all the time
but again we give it to him in little tiny pieces
um so i'm not sure that he would associate this with a piece of cheese
um obviously he did know what the s
well i think he knew what the spoon was
although he tried to brush his hair with it
um you know it seemed like he knew that the spoon went in his mouth
but for the most part all of the food he gets at this point is still cut up into little
waffles too
i mean i've given him waffles before
but it comes out of the toaster
and i cut it up
and then i give him three pieces at a time
so i don't know that he knows that this is what he's eating
okay right haha
ah would he recognize any of the animals
do you think
huh um i mean he knows dogs
but i'm not sure that he knew that this was a dog
i'm not sure i would know that's a dog
kinda like a cat
yeah
so that would probably be the one
he's really into mice these days
but i don't think there's any mice here
so no probably not
okay
oop i'm sorry
you lose the peas
okay i think that should be
is there anything else the way he plays at home that you wanna tell us
um whoa
no i mean th his favorite thing these days and probably for the last month or two has been a ball
and so i'm sure if there was a ball in the mix that's what he would've been obsessed with the whole time
okay um i think that's it then
alright
what do ya doing buddy
i'm going to ask you a few questions
and she can just keep playing
you can just keep playing
playing that's fun
you get to hang onto the bumble
or feed him pizza
or whatever
i wasn't really watched you two
but if i could hear a little bit
what do ya think she liked the best this time
she certainly played with the stuffed animals more than last time
but i think she still liked the food the best
it's hard to say though
shh she seemed to enjoy them more but play with them less time
okay so did she play with more kinds of them
definitely
yeah she def
and what did she play with this time
um well she started out with several of the stuffed animals in a row
um th the kangaroo
the otter
the the bumble
the eagle
yes i guess that's all
she sort of ignored the rest
and last time she played with the food most of the time but
and i think she played with food all the time last time
so you get more time with the stuffed animals this time
yeah
and it wasn't a lot of time
but she seemed to enjoy it
and she was very very quiet
she makes lot of noises when she's playing at home
like
and
that's her language isn't it
and she was so quiet
but she seemed happy
yeah yeah well she might've been just really absorbed
yeah or possibly a little tired like we said coming in so
yeah yeah
yeah she was she looked a little tired coming in
did she look at any of the books or the clock
she looked at the clock
not very long
she look at any of the books
we've had trouble reading at home because she closes the books
and it's just just starting to change
where we can read a couple pages instead of one
alright
that's interesting
and she's she's did she go over to the baby before
or is this the first time
definitely the first time with the baby
and that's winnie the
you played with that a lot too
yes you did play with winnie the too
perfect and now i'll just ask you
i'm sure that you um
answered these same questions and some of them might be the same and some of them are probably different since he's so
um active now he might not have been the last time
yeah definitely not like
which of the toys seemed to interest jack the most this time
and which is a good toy for
um cause he he does like other kids and stuff so
um i mean he doesn't sit and play with it but like you know like pretend its but he just he likes to look at it that caught his attention
and then all this stuff like um
he's not into stuffed animals even at home
i think the objects things that look like stuff at home like the sippy cup he picked up and
he knew what it what it was
you know like to drink from it and um
i think they're just they're just easier to pick up really
i think the the animals stuffed animals even at home he just doesn't really
he likes hard objects i don't know if that's what that means but
right
and
which of the toys seem to interest jack the least
um the books
an i think its because at home the books are only for um sleep time
we don't have th maybe we should have them out all day but we don't
it's so funny because in some of the studies we play this classical music one of the moms said that's the song we play when we want i'm to
go to sleep so he thought he was gonna go to sleep
aw
we need to get this cord outa here
you just wanna eat it up
you just had lunch why are
isn't food
like you're hungry
food mommy has food
hey here
um do you think that your child's interest has changed in any of the items since you were last here
um
no i think its it kind of all stayed the same i mean last time he wasn't really interested in the books
and and the stuffed animals he just he went for all of things he could pick and hold and look at and feel an
um
that's yeah and the baby and the baby
so no i don't i don't think they've it's really changed
okay
and
if you had to pick a po a book even if it was at bedtime which book do you think that jack would prefer to read or look at
um the one that you could feel the little duck that on the farm the touch and i guess
mkay
um
you know what we don't have like fake food or stuffed animals he's got
um just things that make noise toys and cars 
boy's stuff
boy's stuff i th you know what i noticed this was all very girl like i mean not that its just its even more geared to girls like food they play with f you know babies and stuffed animals
there is no like ca like stuff that he can push and that rolls
cause that's the kinda stuff that we have at home
okay
maybe that's why he can't sit still
right
so do you think he prefers books or toys
um
w
which one
oh toys
yeah
does jack play with any dolls at home
no we don't have any dolls
oh no well we have a spiderman doll and yes
he does play with that
okay
yeah
and you don't really play with pretend food or pretend do you feed the doll do you feed the spiderman
you know what no but i think i'm gonna start tryin do that to see if he gets it you know
and do you think that jack recognized any of the foods from last time you were here or from home
um
i think like the juice
the sippy cup
and
i'd like to say he recognized the cheese cause it is ki you know
it's the square kinda orange um
and maybe and maybe that's about it i don't know if
that's probably the mo
jack
um s do you think yo that jack recognizes the names of any of these items or is beginning to
um
i think cheese
cause he eats a lot of that
drink
i don't know if he knows baby
i think he might cause
we have a friends and i say oh look at the baby but he hasn't said it
okay
that's about it yeah
well that's it
oh we're gonna leave that on
oh i'm sorry right right right
i'm sorry
um so which toys did you think that most interested in playing with
he still likes these silly food things
do you have those at home
no
so probably this is the only place he sees those silly food bits
we do have um
he he went he went to the um little bee guy
no no no
we've w he's s recently been playing with a purple thing that has the same texture as those as is the bee's head
yeah
so he thinks
my shoes
oh he's gonna eat your shoes yeah
he thinks that he thinks that's pretty wild
he loves the texture of them
what other stuffed animals did you think he
well he liked the froggie
he's got two froggies at h two stuffed froggies at home
he likes to pull on hair too
so he liked the froggie
um
do you think
and he liked oh he liked this he liked i think he was interested in either the eyes or the fact that he could maybe get them off
he liked that too
um do you think he'd prefer to play with the books or the toys
he g at home he likes he likes to play with books
he likes
i didn't get to your peekaboo book
but he does he enjoys the peekaboo books and like the touch and feel books
um i think the common thread still is things that he can chew on
i think he's i think common thread books he chews
these things he chews
he likes to chew
do you think he has a preference for like which ones of those
um no he seemed to like the
i mean he's leaning towards the waffles
but last time he liked the burger
this time he still ate the burger too
the pizza
the pizza i think was good because he could get to his molars that i think are coming in
haha that's convenient
yeah yeah mostly the i f h he still likes the chewable things
yeah yeah silly boy
aren't you a ham
okay well i think we're good then
is there anything else that you can tell us about his play
i felt so silly last after last time i left that i hadn't offered him a doll
like i'm like you know indepe well not ind whatever
but you know
what's the word
whatever
you know i got a degree
i got stuff
i'm empowered woman
didn't even occur to h me to give him a doll
haha
so i went home and told my husband
we need to get him a doll
anyways
that's great
doesn't really like to play with it
he pokes it in the eyes a little bit
and and but he's got one so
well i was like
he should
he should have one
so now he's got one
you like that waffle
yes
that's a winner
so that's it i guess
that's good
well thank you for coming in
sure
and now we won't see him again until he's almost two
i know that's crazy
he'll be ginormous by then
yeah
i guess they all will be right
when it gets closer to then we'll schedule an appointment
okay
and in the meanwhile
oh i didn't listen to the thing
oh well
oh i'm sorry
i can play it for you if you'd like
is it is it too inconvenient
i'm just i'm just curious
um i was gonna say
do you wanna be contacted for other studies in between
sure
you've been coming here so often we try to keep him as um as our own
but now that it's a whole year we can kind of let the others
sure
share the wealth
sure yeah i think he has fun coming here
okay
okay
keep playing
keep licking everything
the clock
d you need me to leave this on
yeah
okay
that way i don't have to write anything down
um so have you noticed any changes since the last time
that you were here in terms of his interest in the toys or
interest in toys
these toys
ah no he's pretty much was drawn to the exact same things
he has no interest in the in the stuffed animals
um
on my lap
gavin look at all these toys over here
i'd rather play with the person
sure
okay so he's drawn to the same things you said as last time
no interest in these
he starts usually with the books
then he usually winds up on these things
okay so he was somewhat interested in the books
somewhat
i mean he he picked up one
and then he threw it away
okay and that was about the same as last time
okay so you think you think he really both times preferred the um food and dishes
and we've started at home now incorporating books into like his play times too
so he can just
like we did like the touch and feel books so
so i thought he might be more interested in them
but he picked up that one and then
i mean he's still interested in things he can stick in his mouth so
so would you say that could be a reason why he likes those other things
i think so
yeah okay
well and there's there's jus there's variety
and there's there's things to explore in them
um different textures
um things like that so
some of them make noise
they make noise
they move
they resemble things he's familiar with like the bottle
and
right i was gonna ask about that so
i mean he's never had pizza
he's never had spaghetti
and when he eats peas they don't look like this
and his waffles don't really look like this
they're cut up but
so maybe the bottle is the most realistic looking thing
i mean that he put in his mouth the way and
okay
and the sp i mean he recognized the spoons
spoons mean food to him so
particularly this spoon
this one was more like a shaky thing
but this one was more like a spoon to put in his mouth
so he likes doing that
and he did the right thing with it
okay so you recognize those things
right gavin
alright
which
what he did different this time compared to last time he was did a little bit more copying
which he had never really done before
like i shook that
and then he shook these
um so he's done that a little bit more
interesting
was there any other kind of copying that he was doing today
i mean for the most part i was f following him
i was letting him lead but
and then that seemed to engage him
yeah
when you did that
i mean that's how i let him play at home
i let him kinda have free reign
i don't really direct his his play yet
i mean
so go ahead
like i'll stack blocks or something to get him interested in 
but i usually let him
just do what
j do what he wants to do
and at home if you did the same thing that you did here sort of um copy what he does
is he noticing that more
engaged with that more
absolutely
at home too
like um if i'm if i shake a rattle he'll shake one too
or he'll come over and pick one up and shake it
often what he does if i'm shaking something he'll come and take it outta my hand
and do what i was doing
and then i'll pick up another one and do it with him
um
okay so it's a back and forth kinda thing you're doing
gavin
yeah
i hear him talking
so would you say the same as last time that these were the toys that interested him the least today
same as last time
i'm just gonna
sure
he'll just eat that paper
it should be able to come with you if you wanna move around with it
he's a paper loving guy huh
here you wanna book
he can play with this now right
yeah
whoa
like with that car that he got last time
after he saw me move it back and forth then he would start to move it back and forth too
gavin look
oh it's this way
which way does it go
hah here it comes
and
show her how it works
no no wires
so you may have already as answered this but
um are there any items that you think his interest has changed around
between the last time and this time
this toys here
no
no okay
we're not gonna play with the wires thank you
we're gonna play over here
okay um and which book of these do you think he would prefer
the one with the touch and feel one
whoa
and did you play with any similar kinds of toys like these at home
just the books but
we still don't do any pretend toys
and he doesn't have
we just use stuffed animals really to distract him like when we're changing his diaper and stuff like that
he doesn't really play with
does he
i guess in his in his toy box he has like a stuffed cookie monster or and an elmo
that he sometimes plays with
but um it's not a preferred thing
we usually
it's not a preferred thing
and does he play with any dolls at home
just those stuffed animals
we don't have a doll at home
although i did think about getting one after the last time we were here haha
he seemed interested in the baby this time
he was more interested in it last time i think
now he just wants to lick the face
um and i i know we asked you this last time
but i don't remember what you said
d do you think he recognized any of those besides the bottle um and the spoon
oops you found our microphone
no there's nothing else there that
you can move over this way
that he would have had
okay and okay and last question
do you think there were any toys any of these items that he would recognize the names of yet
book or story maybe
okay
but you know a lot of the questions that are in the developmental questionnaires about asking if he recognizes words
it's hard to know so much of what we do is part of a routine
you know when we go and sit down in the in the rocking chair that's when we're reading
so he knows we're reading
right
there's one book that he's started to recognize that he actually says something when he sees
he has the book um moo baa lalala
it's the sandra boyton book
and when he sees it he goes
lala
so
you know that huh
so he knows that book
yeah
but
um and then are there
so that's oh that you answered my next question
yeah if there any th any items at home that you think he would recognize that he doesn't have here
so that particular book
by by by the name of it
yeah by the name of it
it's so hard to know what words he knows we pair everything with gestures
you know s i always it was so hard to fill out those questionnaires because there's very little that we do without a gesture with it
you know when we say eat we're always saying eat or walking over to his highchair or showing him food
when it's time for a baba we say baba and show him the bottle
so you were having to take a guess but
i'm taking a guess on a lot of things
okay well that's fine
i mean i think he recognizes animal sounds
like moo and woof woof or whatever
okay well that's great
that's that's all we need
just a general idea of
but he's still right now this is i mean his main thing now is just gross motor things
and he's just learned how to climb
and that's really what he wants to do
it'll be interesting to see what he's like when he comes back in two years
hopefully he's talking when he's two
he comes back in two years
or he comes back when he's two
when he's two
so about a year
yeah
so i can go ahead and turn this off
have you noticed
this visit that he was um
that he have different interests
in different toys or
some kinds
um he seemed to
he seemed ta
have a maybe longer attention span
with a few of them
food
okay
um
he's getting
to eat more
like finger food table food
okay
kind of stuff so
i thought he was
most interested in the food you'd say
i think so
yeah
okay um
do you think he'd recognize
any of the foods we have here
any of the names of them
um
the peas he's had
fairly frequently
so that might be when
he recognizes
uh huh
and maybe from last time
i can't remember what
food we played with last time
but i know we played with some food
yeah it's been a while
so
um
do you guys have play food at home
we do
okay
alright
so that's why okay
um
which would you say he's least
interested in
which uh set
uh um
probably the stuffed animals i guess
okay
we don't have many
because his older brother
doesn't like them
he seems to be a little bit interested
so
right you have a bird
o
alright and um
do you
read books at home
okay
do you have of the ones you have here
t
uh
we have put me in the zoo and the foot book
and we've gotten this one from the library a few times
um
so would you say he's into toys
or books
now
um mostly toys
okay
the books he's not so interested in
looking through them he wants to close them
haha
ugh yeah
you're two on them
what about
what about the doll did he like the doll
at all
he wa didn't seem very interested
no
you have any of those at home
we have o
um but it's his brothers
okay
so he doesn't
i dunno
he doesn't see it much
play with it
oh okay
o
um
do you think he'd recognize any of the
um
animals
you have
maybe
the names of them
um
we just went to the
fair
so we saw a bunch of
like farm animals i don't see any
farm animals
do you think he would know a dog
um yeah he might
i don't know that
those look like any of the dogs ha
yeah
haha
he has seen
okay
oh okay
um
i think that's it
um
plus is there anything you can think of
that he plays at home
we have a lot of cars
and trucks
and trains and all that
and he he seems very interested in them
uh huh
pushing them around
right
okay i think
he's started to enjoy puzzles
just
taking the pieces out
trying to put them back
okay
either while he's standing or sitting down
so
alright
combing
what he's able to do
you know
right
okay
i think we're all set then um
okay
did you guys get a prize
we did
no
ready to go
don't with
what we need from you guys
that was just
okay
fifteen minutes
so i can just ask you a few questions
sure
i know you wanna
get her changed
haha ha
ha
i think at one point she was
a little distracted cause she was
focusing on
oh yeah
ha ha
well what did you sthink was
her favorite
um
items or types types of items today
i would have to say the cookies
haha
ha since she
has been holding them the entire time
and or trying to eat them
and do you think she recognizes
that as a food that she's seen before
ah no
i i don't think she recognizes any of the foods yet because
she's eating foods like this
but we usually just give her
you know we'll give her five or six small pieces at once
so she doesn't necessarily see the full
the full
yeah
you know she'll have pizza but it'll be a few pieces of you know a few little bites of pizza not the full slice
so
and so
do you think she just likes
i i'm not sure if it was the colors or
they don't
i don't think they look like toys she has
um
so i don't know what it is about the cookies
that she likes in particular
but
i see that she's wanted to hang onto them
yeah haha
um
so did you think that she liked anything else
besides the cookies today
um
i was sorta surprised she she loves books with flaps
and she didn't seem very interested
so i think the cookies kind of
for some reason
were such a focus
but usually she loves books like this
um
so she does have books at home
t yeah
oh yeah
yeah the peekaboo books are her favorite
and she has
not this one but
where's baby's i dunno it's by the same author
but um
she likes
she likes those so
we've got some
we've got a book over there
that has some textures does she have any like that or
yeah
one
her peekaboo books all have textures in it and she
she sleeps with a couple of 
and when
you know she wakes up in the morning
she'll play with them
and i'll come in and all the pages are open
and she's been you know
she knows right where to go on the page
to touch the texture and
so
does she have any um baby dolls
of any kind
no
okay
does she have stuffed animals
t um
yeah
she
has a few that are favorites um
she's got a dog
that she sleeps with every night
and there's a couple of rabbits
um
that are sort of her cuddly animals
um
i noticed you were
showing her some of them
i don't remember which ones but
um
do you
have
do you guys
do you go through animal things with her
names of animals or sounds or things like that
yeah
yeah
i try to stick with the ones that make noises i know haha
ha ones that i went i don't know what noise this makes
but i could tell you what it's called
but it's not gonna be as interesting haha ha
right
haha
yeah we have some odd ones in here don't we
haha ha
like i know this is a deer
but what did but what sound do deer make
right
i'm not really sure
so
haha
right
exactly
uhoh
uhoh
pick it up
you dropped a cookie
here's your cookie
here's the cookie
whoop
here it is
yeah
haha
there it is
ha good job
okay
and she did just learn earlier this week so big
which is why she sometimes just does it
cause she wants to hear
so big and
get that response
so big
one day
she just went around the living room
she just kept going like this
so then you'd have to keep
right
haha
ha
she looks like she likes this chair
yeah
she doesn't have any kid chairs at home
she used to at daycare and she loved it
um i just haven't gotten one for her yet
now you're talking
now you're talking
haha
um let's see
so
do you th she
you said she probably wouldn't recognize any of the food items
as food items
would she recognize any of the names of food items
no
the only thing she knows
um
she knows the concept of being hungry and
um
t
she asks for more but i think that she thinks it just means food
um
and she
asks for milk
um
with sign language those are the only two she's doing right now
um
but
you know and yesterday i wasn't sure if she just
thought she always had to show more when she was eating
but yesterday we were she was eating
and
just i was giving her fruit
and
i was eating some
and she was eating some and i had a bunch cut up ready to give her
and i one point i said do you want more
and she kinda looked at me and turned around and started playing
so
she wasn't just doing it in a response to me always saying it
i think she's started to figure out
if i don't want more i don't say it and i haha
you know
i don't get it
so
yeah okay
you feel like you're starting to get uh to pair the meanings with
yeah
and
out of these things here um
what do you think she liked the least this visit
um
everything but the cookies
haha
haha okay fair enough
um
and do you
feel like
the way she's played
or the things that she's played with today are different than the last time you here
um
she usually goes for the food
i think because just
plastic and she likes to put plastic toys in her mouth
um
oh now you have the peas
you had peas for lunch amelia
you liked them
they were yummy
right
um
so i think usually she goes for the food
and i'll try ta
i always try ta
bring in books and read to her
sometimes she's playing
and i'm reading a book
and she's not really paying any attention but
and everything
yeah
but i figure
you know even if she just hears it
right
so
right there's no harm
done
and does she have any
favorite toys at home that aren't here
um
she has a set of stacking cups that she really likes
and um
sorting
um
like a sorting thing
um
the
she usually loves the peekaboo books
and she'll
there's a couple other books she likes too
i think one's like baby's first words
and it's kinda got a soft cover
and i don't know if it's the cover that she likes or
the images are all um
they're actual photographs
instead of
you know
drawn things and she
and actually now that i think about it the peekaboo books are photographs too
so i dunno if she prefers photograph books to other things
um
that's interesting
but
um
what else do you like to play with at home
a few moms have said
oh you don't have it here but my child loves balls for instance
um
she's
i mean
we don't have a lot of balls really the only balls we have around the house are
the tennis balls for the dogs
okay
and she doesn't really seem to have much interest in them
does she like
the dogs
yeah
um sometimes she'll ignore them sometimes she plays with them
or she tries to
she loves to feed them treats
okay
she love she thinks that's really funny
um
and she sometimes likes their bones haha
um
but a lot of times they see her coming and they're like
i'm out of here
haha ha
ha that's that's that kid again
oh they're
they're smart
haha
i remember that stage
kids were that her age
um
okay
so let's see
that might be
does she have any dishes and
and play food at home
no
not yet
um
no
okay
i think
alright so
o
i think we've asked you this before but
um
in case we haven't
what toys do you think are the best ones for her
personality
um
or why do you think certain toys interest her
like i said i think
she likes the feel of the plastic
to chew on
um
and
maybe
also because they are a little bit smaller
these are a little bit bigger right
you know for her
hands and so these are easier to
to pick up
um
does she like toys that make noise
not so much
nah i mean
w we don't really have any toys that require batteries
so she when she sees them
yeah the banging
we have some
musical toys um
because we have a tambourine and some other things and
sometimes she'll play with them
but i think i like them more than she does haha ha
and i bought her one of the little
pianos that that you know just has the four notes
and you press the buttons and everytime
oh amelia come look
and i'll play it and she'll look at it
and then she'll just turn it over
haha like okay
this was a bust haha
at least for now
i'm sure as she gets older
right f it would be more interesting
but
okay so it's not so compelling
yeah no
hah
i think that's all
oh but she has a maraca she loves
oh
we didn't tell about that
a maraca
right
uh huh
it's got a nice handle and you just shake it
you shake your maraca right
makes a nice noise
okay
well is there anything else that we should know that i didn't ask you
i don't think so
what do you think amelia
well thank you though
so we're gonna see you when you're two
ah
another year
so is it okay for people to
for other labs or our lab to call you if there's studies in the meantime that she's the right age for
yeah
okay
so we'll leave you as
it's okay to contact
yeah
and we'll call you
um well ahead of her
next
okay
visit to set something up
here you go kiddo
careful whee
guess i can ask you some questions now
okay
since you've been playing for a while
i wasn't really looking at him too much
so i'm not sure what he liked best
um out of these
but these look more spread out than these so that's what i'm guessing
yeah
i think definitely um he went for the clock again and the food stuff
and the food
excuse me
yes
specifically these peas
i don't know why
especially those
yeah
did he like anything else um foodwise
he liked this
was it th this one or the red one
was more um
this one
yeah
and then i don't know if it was color choice or not but
and then he liked this cookie once i showed it to him
but he hasn't really had cookies yet i mean i just think maybe the multiple colors
the colors
yeah
the measuring spoons he liked the way that jingled
didn't i tried to get him interested in the stuffed animals to see
and he didn't show any interest really
i thought you were doing the rooster i thought he would like that
but he didn't show too um
he didn't seem to
not really
didn't spark anything with him this time
looks like he's found it again
yeah
he really likes that
yeah and i i mean i haven't looked for anything similar to that but
i remember last time he liked that right
he did
and then when we asked him you know when i said
where's the clock
h h he went toward it
but this time he didn't seem to really register the way it did the first time
yeah
was that the main thing that he liked last time
i'm trying to remember
yes yes
he just stayed with that for the longest time
okay
and now he's found
oh look it he's trying a lot of things huh
yeah
and he likes to just pick things up and throw them to see how they sound when they land like that
you know these things are heavier
and i could see that he was like
huh
right
that made a different thud instead of the the peas that were so light
so do you think he likes them for that reason
so ju different things they're different weights and they sound different
i think that's what he likes to experiment with is yeah
just seeing how they
what gravity does huh
like what happens when i do this right
yeah your little science
haha
did he try any of the books today
he didn't
i got the peekababy out
and he didn't seem to even recognize what i was trying to read
okay okay
oh i know you tried with
i tried the kangaroo
kangaroo
that's it
and the chicken or rooster
no interest there
okay
no
he didn't like pitcher until i put something in there
oh
it made a sound
yeah
made a sound
that was
so he didn't
that was that that he liked
and but he you know when he got it out then he didn't want the pitcher anymore
he didn't wanna try to put it back in like
sometimes he might
balance out huh
yeah
it does
you found the clock again i know
um let's see
if or at home maybe um if you're reading a book with him
would he rather turn the pages himself or does he like you to to sort of do that
he wants to hold the book
he wants to hold it okay
what i found yesterday was that the best thing was for him to be in his highchair haha
to try to read because otherwise he's grabbing it
and depending on you know these pages books are fine but the thinner ones he would just be tearing at this point so
but he wants to be
he wants to be in control of that
exactly
and would you say he likes toys better at this point than books
definitely
okay
um does he play with any dolls at home
he hasn't
and my daughter has a lot
but he hasn't he's gone toward her favorite doll a few times but i think it's only because she plays with it so much
i don't really think
it's not so so much that it's a doll
right i mean all the out of all these dolls he didn't go for that
he wanted to play with this doll's eyes a little bit
and touch the mouth and the nose
but i don't think he was really
i don't i don't think dolls are his interest area now
okay
um so would you say that i know it's not the food toys but the animals or the books interested him the least this visit
which one was sort of least interesting
um i would say the books would be the least interesting this time
okay
i mean it seemed like i sparked a little bit of interest with the puppet and the r chicken but not
and the books i mean i may as well have not been saying anything
didn't seem to do anything with those
and which kinds of toys do you think are good for his personality
the stuff that has an effect like when he's shaking the the um teaspoons or the measuring spoons
he can hear a reaction
so um at home there's a little play piano
so he likes to po i mean he's not playing it
but he likes to pound on it because he knows that it makes a sound
um i don't know
does he have any of those toys that um you push a button and something pops up
yes
he like he likes those
he likes things there's a
so cause and effect
cause and effect kinda thing
where he's you press a button and plays music
or i can't rememb it's something that you can hang on the side of a crib
but we don't use it for that
um but there's a little um dial that you can turn
and like these two gears turn
so he likes to see that happen
um yeah push and pull kinda stuff
anything that he can hit to make a sound or
okay
fair enough huh
yeah and the kitchen my ah our play kitchen's in the basement
but he would be all over this stuff too if he could just
whatever he can shake and
whatever's making noise
move or press buttons
right
does he
pounds things together all the time
yeah
he was trying to do that with something there
um and it didn't make much of a noise
i think it was the two peas
it was like the peas and something
yeah
and it didn't really didn't really do anything for him because it didn't make a noise
right
right so you s you skipped that and went on to something else huh
do you think he recognizes the names or any of the like food items or the utensils or any of the animal names yet
no
no um you know i filled out that form and i said you know i don't know if he's supposed to know any of this stuff but he doesn't
i mean we
no no there's no they're so variable at this age their interests what um
there's nothing that he's supposed to be doing that we have here
it's just sort of looking at what he wants
of interest
yeah i i can't say that like last time we we che we said like
lucas find the clock
he didn't um i mean he went for it and that totally surprised me
okay
he seemed to know the name of it then
but yeah
and i think there are random things
like i think he knows milk now but not any of the
i i don't think i could say to him you know
get the book
or get the
if you um i think the reason we may be asking that is just that if he did know some of the names and you said the name would he be more likely to go get that than if he didn't recognize any of those names and was just playing so you know
no no sweetie
that's it it's just interesting to look at patterns that way
right
right
he likes chords
um i know you were just here recently
but i wanted to just ask if there have been any chances that you noticed in her interests in terms of what she wanted to play with today
um
compared to last time
seemed like at first she was just the bottle and the sippy and the baby
i don't know if that's because she's getting hungry
and she associated the bottle with herself but
um she seemed more interested this time in the baby
um this is what really had her going last time
texture been a real big thing lately
um
is that a sippy
oh thank you
um different this time
didn't seem as much into animals this time
no that's not for the baby
that's for this baby
see
anything that pretty much bangs
she seems like she really just likes to make noise
and she definitely imitates more
i've noticed even the last couple of weeks
okay
anything that i do she tends to wanna do it too
like when i was doing this
then she wanted to put something in it too
so she definitely likes to imitate
more than she has lately haha
so that's a new thing
yeah she was kinda different things this time
okay
um but again the b this b we have a book very similar
and she loves opening the flaps
so i think a lot of things today she was picking up things she does at home
okay
such as the baby doll
the bottle
the sippy
this book
so she does have a baby doll at home
she d i mean obviously not like it's a little bit smaller
but she has a baby doll at home that she puts in her in the cradle
she kind of tends rocking it and
does she feed that baby doll also
she tries to with her with her bottle at home yeah
okay
um does she play with pretend food at home
um not as much no
so i don't know if it's just something different something new that she just
i didn't notice did she play with any of the food items or kitchen items today much
yeah i mean she was j i mean just kind of more the banging part of it
more so than j really i like putting it in something
okay
she was putting in here
but um was just kind of all different things today right megan
do you think she would recognize any of the food um from the last time or from home
any of the food items
um not as much
i mean we don't really have any actually any food items at home
so i don't just maybe from last time just from playing with them and banging them
but we do i mean we don't have any of these same foods
any of these
fake food items
no
do you think she would recognize any of these um comp you know as real food items
i know peas don't really come like this
but they look a little like this
she still really
she has kind of food aversions
she's really only eating mainly baby food
so i don't know if she'd really recognize
she would recognize these okay
she's a little young for that
yeah maybe like the cookies just from holding trying to you know take bites of baby cookies but
okay
i think this she definitely recognized from last time haha
unique
she likes the hair texture
which of the toys do you think or which toy is good for her her personality
no no no no no
um she's pretty active
so i think anything that she likes to make you know do the noises and haha hold things
she's pretty active pretty ah personable baby
so i think doing things that make you know sound and effect or
making people look at her haha
like doing that
which is maybe why the animals she doesn't really have as much of an interest
i see they don't do
it's pretty much of her like sleeping thing at home
she sleeps with an animal but
okay
that's really the only time she really plays with stuffed animals
do you think she prefers books or toys
um during the day i'd say probably toys
i mean she's at daycare all week
it's mainly you know toys
that they're kind of playing with
although th this book she seems very fascinated by the flaps but
we do read the books at night and so
but i think during the day she mainly is with toys
haha megan
which of these toys do you think interests her the least
um well other than this i'd say all the stuffed animals
i think when i put in front of her she didn't really seem to go for them
let's see
you like this one though huh
you like that hair tickle your tummy
which which of these books do you think she would most wanna look at with you
um the peekababy
okay
just she's involved in it
and she can do something also
okay i think that's it
do you have anything else that you think we should know about that i didn't asked you
not that i can think offhand
i'm surprised she actually sat here
and now she's so mobile crawling around
she did
she does a lot of the crawling all over the place at home
so i'm surprised she sat here for the
so she was definitely interested
i think maybe it was something different
yeah
i mean that's why she sat so much longer than at home
it's the same old toys
yeah
so i think she gets more bored easily
she did sit the whole time
oops
yeah she's usually crawling on everything
all over the room so
haha is that fun
you like that hair
that is fun isn't it
that seems to be your favorite toy right now
sure does
okay well i think that's all i have to ask you
maybe she can just play a little bit while i ask you some questions
sure
um i don't know how long ago you were here last
but it probably wasn't that long ago
um so do you remember from last time what she was interested in compared to today
pretty much the same
she likes these things
she loved the keys
i think again like the teeth are coming in
and everything's going in the mouth
it fee it probably feels good
yeah so
did she like the keys today as well
yeah
i rem i remember the keys
yeah
definitely
she wasn't as into the books
usually before she liked the books
but today not so much into the books
yeah
and she
is that just a today kind of thing
yeah
she loves this thing
this has always been a uh a big favorite
oh yeah
huge favorite
and why do you think
i think she likes these
i think it tickles her
and she giggles all the time
she thinks this is hysterical
and she likes to play with them
so yeah
okay
big fan
um did she like any of the other animals
uh you know i'm not too sure
like we have a dog at home
so i thought the dog might be interesting
and she's like eh
she didn't really didn't really seem to care
the food she really liked
okay
yeah
and i see that yeah she likes to put in her mouth
do you think that's the reason or do you think there's some other reason that she likes the food items
um i don't know
i mean i think she just like she likes them she can put them in her mouth
she really i mean she likes to pick up peas you know by her herself and put them in her mouth one at a time
like that's she loves really does love peas
um and she's kind of getting the hang of the uh the sippy
but not really
but usually when she she has one at home
but she'll just play with it
she'll chomp on it
but she won't really drink out of it
so
and the same thing with the spoon
like she'll play with it
but she doesn't she can't really coordinate it to eat anything from it
but play with it bang with it you know
did she do that today
did she do something with the spoon
yeah she was playing with the big spoon little spoon
she was turning them around
she was kind of hitting them a little bit
yeah
okay
so do you think any of these items the food type things are familiar to her from home at all
yeah pro the spoon pro the peas
um really i mean not really the
i don't know if she's really seen like cookies like this
but you know like the little she's had some kind of little like biscuity type things so maybe
but i don't think she's ever seen peas qui
usually she sees them like individual
she's never seen a chunk of peas like this
a lot of moms comment on that
but if you had little small ones i bet the kids would eat 
yeah
probably would
you probably would eat 
yeah
oh there's the doggie
okay so so compared with last time you feel like she's interested in similar things
yeah
except for not as much books
less books
um more i think probably more of these little guys
and she's never really been a huge kind of stuffed animal fan
so
how about um baby dolls
does she have any of these at home
you know she doesn't have any of them at home
and last time we kind of played with it for a little bit
but you know i think she's kind of like the same thing with these you know
same kind of attention span with 
okay
let's see
um in general though do you think she prefers toys or books
you know before i would have said books
but now she seems to like these the toys more
i think she can do more with them
whereas before she could like turn the pages of the books
and like you know when they had little things they could lift she'd love that
you know she could figure out how to do it
but now she likes these things she can kind of explore them more and
yeah like she's trying to get the little blue thing off the dogs
but there
look at that
yeah
she noticed that
and she's
yeah i think it's like the one hard thing on there
and i
yeah
she's it out
let's see what else
um do you feel like any of these things here are in any way um good for her personality type
like sort of um go with her personality
yeah definitely
i mean you know i think these little things are good because she can yeah she can explore
i mean we have lots of blocks at home
so i think these are kind of you know like blocks
she can play with them
she can bang around
she can put in her mouth
she can you know
they're kinda they're they're yeah they're a good size for her like that
i see
yeah
she can really grasp that
she can really yeah whereas
and these things might be i don't know a little too big
or i don't know
maybe just not as
turning that over
yeah
yeah
at it
yeah
okay
and let's see
do you have any of these particular books at home or anything like them
uh we have yeah
we have the this one the little the definitely the any of these little peekaboo things
we have some of these
we have good night moon
we have something like the on the farm
um we definitely have some of the i think we do have the mister brown
um yeah
she does and she does like books
she likes books
and i think she likes them more when she's kind of getting ready to like nap or something
and right now is
there's been a lot of people
yeah
so
but she i mean she will do this
like she'll play with books and
she's really looking at it
then she wants to eat it
um okay
oh does she have any pretend food or things like that at home kitchen type things
no
i mean we have like you know the spoo we have the little plastic baby spoons and stuff
um but that's really it
but not really
but no yeah no pretend food yet
although it does seem like fun
well maybe someday
yeah sure
and so you were talking about when you read books with her she likes to turn the pages
do you think she when you do read books that she prefers to do that or have you like read to her
does she like to be more the one
she she likes to i mean she likes to really kind of to be involved
like she likes to you know
we have this one with all these different dogs and some of the little dogs move and stuff
and she always goes to things that move first
and when she's kinda done she'll kinda ready to move turn that page
be like i'm done with this page
okay so she likes to be the one to decide when she's done with a page
yes
turn it herself
yeah
yeah
okay
yeah you do
um
you do
that's that's all that i have that i need to ask you
is there is there anything that i didn't ask that you think i should know about her preferences and the way she's playing with toys now
no not really
not that i can think of
i mean basically if it can go in the mouth and she can pick it up it's it's a hit
it's a hit
she likes it
yeah
you're not that picky
although she does love those keys
well they also make a noise
i wonder if that has
yeah i kinda wonder that too she has recently realized that if you bang things it makes noise
and she thinks that's lots of fun
does she
oh yeah
like with um pots and pans or does she have other toys that she likes
yeah um just even like you know like the little tray in her um high chair
and like today like we still have the little baby bathtub in the other bathtub
but she realized if she bangs one toy against the edge of the real bathtub it makes noise
and isn't that fun to do that again
yeah
so i think that's that's exciting for her
she's learning a lot
and this is her main mode of transportation right now
the roll
you were saying that
she really uses that
she does
not so much into like figuring out how to crawl
she can kind of scoot around
but
so when she wants to see if something is over there or over there she'll roll to look
she'll roll
she'll roll to it yeah
that works for you doesn't it
yeah it does
that's okay then
and then she'll kind of like she can slither forwards and backwards and that's about it
yeah
like to reach
yeah
to a reach
cool
yup
all right
that that's the
oh i see you doing that
yeah that's the extent of her mobility
she's got a strong back for propping herself to look
she just likes it
yeah she does
i think she just likes the position
she can go around the whole room
um so i know you were here just last week haha
but which toys do you think were most interesting to him
again it was the food that was the most interesting to him
he didn't didn't really want anything to do with the stuffed animals
he threw the one i gave to him after a few seconds and
why do you think that that interested him
i have no clue
he doesn't like stuffed animals at home and
so i guess those just aren't interesting to him
the books he wants the ones he can touch and feel with st the texture stuff
otherwise he's not really interested and he wants it to do something
do you have any of the books we have here at home
we don't have the extact same ones no
we have touch and feel books but not that one
um do you think anything do you think his interests have change since he was here last
i don't think so
it's still pretty much the same
he wants the food
and he's interested in the baby doll
but he doesn't really know to do with it
he tried although this time he did try to hand the baby doll a toy
which he hadn't done before
before he just stared at the baby doll
hi grumpy
um so you said you don't have stuffed animals at home but
we do
he won't play with them
oh okay
yeah they don't play with them yeah
and we do have some food
but nothing like this
he's got like hot hamburgers and some vegetables
so he doesn't have any of the the same things that you guys have
do you think he would recognize the names of any of the food items we have
he'd probably recognize bread and pizza
especially since he had it last night
um do you think that he prefers books or toys
toys
yeah
still toys yeah
um can't remember did you say that he plays with dolls at home
we don't have any dolls at home
so
mommy has to get you a doll i know
um oh okay are there any other items that you think he doesn't recognize the name of
that he wouldn't recognize the name of
some of the food stuff he wouldn't recognize
like spaghetti
even though we have it it's not something he eats yet
so he wouldn't recognize that
i don't think he'd recognize um like waffle
and the meat
i believe it's meat haha
pieces of ham and stuff
most of the other stuff he'd recognize
at least he's seen before
is there anything else you'd like to tell us about his play at home
no he likes trains and trucks
but that's probably because that's what his brother plays with all the time so
they compete for trains and trucks
yes
do you remember what macy played with last time
i think it was the plates
yeah
i think so
uh did you notice any difference have you noticed even at home any differences with how she plays with things at home
um
not really
she um
she's
i don't know
she's usually
just
like this like she'll get tired of a toy like
within five seconds and go on to the next
say
hi
is so is she still into toys rather than more so than books
um
no i have some books that i put in front of her that she likes
they're like the huge
books that have like million and one different like pictures of things and
um
but she likes those books and then of course the ones that make noise
so but
and then
she has a good night moon book
it's not this one this ones the counting book but like
the regular good night moon book that she likes
okay
so
um have how so today she played with well what do you think was her like favorite thing
today
all this food stuff
like um
a couple times she would grab the stuffed animals or i would try to
introduce the stuffed animals or the book and
she might've played with them for like two seconds but then decide to either grab the pizza or the peas
so
okay
and do you think she recognized the names of any like any of the foods familiar
um probably pizza
because and as soon as she seen the pizza and picked it up she tried to eat it
she had pizza a few nights ago
so
i think she recognized and was like hey
but um
other than that
she eats peas but we don't really specifiy that she's eating peas at the moment
but
anything else
other than the bottle
i don't even know if i had said bottle but
that would be the other really other thing she i think would understand what it was
yeah
uh how like the sundaes or the the co the ice cone
um
she might recognize ice
she gets ice at home
um
or like when we're out but
um
i don't think we have it often enough for her to
um
kinda put two and two together
but that's a big treat though for her to get that
yeah
do you have any um similar toys at home
um we don't have any of the food which i should probably get
um
sh sh has she has a bunch of stuffed animals but she really doesn't like to play with them at home either
i would say probably the only thing that i know she has is the keys
and she has a babydoll at home too but she's not really into the playing with babydolls stage yet i guess
did she
so
today
kind of like i um
put it next to her and she kinda looked at it like
what's goin on but
but um
and then like a couple seconds later she went back to it and was like pullin it towards here an
like messin with it's hand
so
you're crawlin all over the food
slippery huh
having fun
you having fun
um so you said you have the animals at home
yeah
does she know them like by name or is she familiar with the name at least
probably the only
animal
that she would know the name of other than dogs have dogs or puppy
like she knows the names of those
and um
the only other one that like stuffed animal wise i think she would recognize is a bunny
she has a bunny that she plays with constantly at home
like it not plays with she usually sleeps with it
so
but say i can't go to bed without my bunny
do you think she's um she's at home more interested in some categories
um stuffed animals dolls food books like that
um
at home
she probably likes more hard plastic toys the best
um like she'll look through books and like like she's reading
but um and then the stuffed animals but she doesn't
really
play with like she'll play with for a few minutes but she'll always go back to that hard plastic
so
is she eating soups at home or anything like brothy
um
not yet we've just started introducing a lot of foods so
um
but like a couple weeks ago she had pizza and she's had
um
she's had uh
a lot of stuff actually i don't think though
i've ever given her
soup or anything like that
so
um i was just bringing it up because i saw the
oh yeah
so i was just thinking
trying to formulate it in some way
uh so the food was a big success today and what do you think was the thing she went for the least
probably the books
every time and especially this book
i remember her kind of
messin with it last ni either last time or the time before of the little patches of hair but
all of the books like i would put in front of her and she'd be like eh
she's like there's food here
how is she playing with the food what do you think she likes about the food
um
i don't know
like a couple of times she would bang it together and then
like with the peas
she had like they when we got here they were on a plate like this
and she picked up played with them for a little bit tried to put back on the plate
and when that didn't work she tried to put it on the other side
but um
and then
other than that she
you're losing all sorts of traction
um
other than that i think she was just kinda holding them checking out an
bangin them a little
and throwing them
that toy i handed it to her and she was like threw it over her shoulder i was like oh
experimenting
are there any other foods you can think of that she may be familiar with and
maybe cookie
uh i mean she has like the little bitter biscuits that like melt in their mouth and we call her cookies
so um she might recognize it but she doesn't get often they're so messy so
um
other than that
i don't think she really
would recognize them or the name of them
so
okay so bread or
no we don't eat a lot of bread type stuff in our house so
she doesn't i don't think she's ever tried pancakes or waffles or bread or anything
so
alright
yeah
okay well that's it for the line of questioning today
alright
gonna ask you a few questions
oh okay
we look tired
yeah
it's ten o'clock
so i know it wasn't very long ago that she was here but do you notice any differences in this play session
from which
not really no
really
she yeah she last time i think she spent more time on the stuffed animals
than the food stuff but
does she know a lot of those animals like
uh not really no
i mean we don't she's got stuffed animals at home but mostly bears
so she doesn't have a lot of stuffed animals i mean of different kinds
and we have a lot of unusual ones
yeah
the donkey and
hey careful
huh
but she was interested enough that you sorta let her
oh yeah that's
this has got to stay no no it stays right there
no no
no
no
no no no no no no
you know it could be better
yeah
you don't have to write everything down
and it will still pick up what you say
yeah
um okay so you didn't notice any big changes except for that she spent you said some more time
yes she was more interested in the food stuff
i mean she played with the food stuff last time but she was more interested last time in the stuffed animals i think
okay did she have any favorite animal last time
i don't remember
uh
like you said she
i think she did
i think the goose
ah interesting
maybe i was gonna guess maybe dog because you said she liked that book about the dog
yeah
but they don't look that much like dogs
i don't remember
i know i think there was one but i can't remember
i think it's like the the
which one
yeah she didn't seem too interested this time and i i
i don't remember last time her being overly interested in it
okay
but i think did you show her that today
no she looked at it
i didn't i didn't pick it up or anything
okay
she kinda picked it up and tossed it aside
okay
to get to what she wanted
okay
so much more into carrying things now
even then it was just a couple of weeks ago that we
yeah
were here
yeah
and um much more into carrying things and throwing
what did she like to carry around
the pizza the spaghetti uh spoons she loves spoons
hey no throwing
no throwing
um okay
and do you think she recognizes
oh yeah
things
oh she does okay
yeah she knows spoon
she she tried to like scoop up the spaghetti with the spoon
she she actually when we feed her she won't eat baby food anymore
she wants big people food but she has to have a spoon and she tries to feed herself with it
hasn't quite managed it yet but she'd trying
right
independent
very
does she eat um peas or
she loves peas
pizza spaghetti
noodles of any kind veggies fruit
wow how about the dessert stuff
she uh she's never seen ice cream like this
okay
although she did make a couple motions like she was pretending to eat it
um but she does like ice cream
okay
don't throw it
oh
ugh
and let's see
and then did she look at the baby at all or the books
ignored them completely
how about how does she those things at home or does she have
she well at home books are all over and
she she looks at them
baby dolls are a big battle between her and her sister so they usually want if jackie's carrying it around she wants it but i guess without jackie being around to introduce the babydoll she's like eh
i don't know
she she has she has this little babydoll that's only about that big that she loves to carry around
o
eh
you wanna sit
so she does carry a lot around
okay
yep
and like you said there's books all over the place does she show an interest in those
does she turn the pages or
yeah
likes to carry them
yeah she likes books she uh tries to eat them
don't you
let's see are there any other favorite toys that she has at home that we don't have here
um uh push thingies like walking
yeah yeah
thingies like that kinda stuff but um
her
and i noticed you
her
were singing winnie the
does she have watch any of that
she uh sometimes her favorite is mickey mouse clubhouse
but she does she watches tigger and friends
or my friends tigger and pooh whatever that winnie the one on is on
but uh
she her big sister watches a lot of cartoons
so she she watches them with her sometimes
sure
um alright
i asked you
um is she just as mobile now as she was two weeks ago
yeah pretty much
kay
she's getting a little bit faster but
okay
she was good about not going for the cords i was
wondering if she was gonna do that
yeah uh what are oh hi
you gonna climb on
all done
maybe you're all done
i think i asked you everything
okay
um if there was anything i didn't ask about that you saw that she was interested in just let me know that
i'm hoping so
uh she definitely was more into the walking over them
yeah
last time i think she just walked like a little bit but uh
well i know does she pour anything
cause you were using the pitcher with her
i don't think she does
but when they get a bath my husband uses uh pitcher kinda thing to wet their hair but i don't think she pours
okay
right
she's curious
kay that's it
now i don't do you remember what um he primarily played with last time you were here
yeah it was i think he did more of the stuffed animals
and the baby
he always goes to the baby
do you think he remembers it in particular
um he has one at home
so i don't know if he remembers this particular baby
but he does have a doll at home that he likes to play with so
are there other things here that are like what you have at home
um he has some stuffed animals
but he doesn't really pay much attention to 
he has books at home um that he likes to look through
and he'll listen to a short story usually
the plates
um did he play as much with the food items before
no
he didn't
i think he spent more time today with the food items than he did previously
do you think there's anything there that he'd recognize
no
probably not because he's not a good eater
so he
no the only thing i he did seem to he could kinda match if i shh you know showed him
he did like to hold things that were the same
but i don't think he really knows what they are because he really doesn't he's not a good eater
so mostly looking for things that came for which there were there were pairs
yeah or were similar um in shape i think
he had you know or you know like he would pick up the two spoons or
where you going
do you think there was anything else among those that made them particularly interesting
um of the foods i think well the bottle he's used to those
so he did that
um and i think to put the cookie in here
he was trying to get it out
but i think it kinda frustrated him a little bit that he couldn't get it out
connor
not yours
connor
connor
come here
hi
come here
not yours
come here
connor
yeah
you coming
you want that box huh
see the stickers
yeah
um were there particular books um that that you also have at home or that you think he'd be familiar with
um no
he doesn't have
he has the foot book at home
but he doesn't really
he is more interested in books with real um babies in 
things like that
or um pictures of real animals he seems to focus on more uh than drawings
okay
and all of those are yeah
yeah
that seems to be what he's doing now
cookie
have you noticed a change in the way he plays with toys at home
yeah he seems to be um it's more purposeful now
you know he's putting things in um taking things out
um he has a stacked ring thing now that he puts things o um he'll put the rings on
and also more frustration
like if he has um a train that balls go in he'll try to put blocks in it
if they don't go in it makes him angry
um if he can't put stack things on the rings that makes him angry
um so
yeah i think he's more purposeful
he loves balls
and he's starting to um chase after them
and he'll try to throw them a little bit
um so i think it's more purposeful kind of play
he's always been a pretty good player
he can play um can keep himself occupied for pretty you know a pretty good amount of time with toys and things just on the floor
when we when you first started playing with the food items i know you pulled out particularly the can
yeah
yeah
he likes to sta he usually likes things to be stacked
and he does like to play with um like real uh soda cans and things like that or water bottles
he'll go and pull them out and play with them
i don't know if it's the so the water in them he likes to shake and kinda maneuver 
that's cheese
where you going
my goodness
come back here
no
no
look
oh you want that huh
that's okay
it'll pull out completely actually
you gonna pull it out
i wouldn't trust it as sturdy enough to try using to stand on
okay
but but it's fine if he tries playing with it
you wanna take those out
you gotta pull hard
pull hard
you wanna put it back in
wanna push it in
wanna push it
there it goes
you got it
does he have a lot of toys at home that make noise
yes
yeah
um a lot of things that he can shake
balls and things like that
and also um um like puppies that will talk or make noise
that kinda
electronic
elecontronic electronic type things yeah
a few of those
remotes that you know you can push buttons and they'll make sounds
whoa
you gonna move it
what you trying to do
you want it out of the way
out of the way
get another one
you're gonna have to move back
i was worrying about that one
i was going
whoops
i thought you were gonna pull so hard you would fall back
you taking it out or putting it in
yeah
whoop
boom
that's two
now there were some things that there were pairs of that you didn't play with
he seemed to not go for example
what's the matter
you don't want it there
he didn't go for the two slices of bread for example
no he didn't
do you think there was something about the ones he did go for
they were smaller maybe and easier for him to hold i guess
it did seem to be like the peas and the
i don't know
whoop
where you going
huh
i don't know
it didn't or maybe the color
i don't know if they were more colorful
what are you doing
what are you doing
yeah there's another one
gonna go get the other one
huh
i was gonna say it almost seemed like he was going for the softer
yeah it ma yeah
yeah it may be
these are definitely harder
yeah things he could squeeze a little bit
no not up there
no
no
what
yeah what do ya want
thought you wanted that last bin
you don't want the last bin
okay
get the last bin
where you going
the table
you can get the bin from this side
you're busy
no you don't need those
no
no
no
i know
no
no
no
no
what
you say hi
what's that
yeah
is that your waffle
boom
i think last time he did play a lot with that
he was interested in the the the holes
he kinda the indentations in it for some reason
does he have anything like that at home
no
i assume he doesn't eat real
no he's not a good eater
other than uh as table foods go he'll eat pieces of bread and cheerios but
not good with things like spaghetti
there's the bread
anything else you particularly noticed either about what he was playing with today or what he seemed interested in or what he does at home
no
what his favorites are
um as far as toys here
i stll i think it yeah
he seemed to spend a lot more time with the foods than he did usually
um you know the bottle and the cup i think he's used to them at home he um put those you know to him
um going for those pens
you like pens too don't you
no
that can break
that can break
that can break
there's your baby
huh
baby
give the baby hugs
yes
that's a bigger baby than your baby isn't it
huh
he has a baby
there's a ba yeah
hugs for the baby
oh
headbutt the baby huh
baby's ear
say hi baby
give baby kisses
yeah
hi baby
done with baby
huh
you all finished with her
look
baby's got shoes
baby's got shoes
yeah
that baby's got shoes
unlike you
yes
that's another thing you like to play with though shoes
you like shoes don't you
no you don't have shoes do you
you just have feet
just your feet
you wrestling with the baby
well as you know this is the the third and last for a while
okay
the next visit isn't until he turns two
so you've still got a ways until you come back for another one of these
um at that point um it will be basically a series of uh language assessments and um working memory tests and a whole bunch of things
so that we can see um as well as some social stuff
no no
um as well as some assessments of kind of again what kinds of things he's interested in social skills cognitive skills
um
connor
no no no
how going back over this way
come this way
what
stop
keep moving
oh shoes
yeah
you got a can
okay
well what do ya think
should we go in the room and get you a toy for participating today
oh don't worry about 
are you sure
yeah i'll take out to put other stuff in
oh that's where they store everything
yeah you were gonna take it out anyway huh
you gonna take it out anyway
that's a big bin huh
that's a big bin
wanna put them in
okay so let's find out what do you think if anything is different about the kinds of things he liked today versus last time
um i think i remember last time him throwing a lot of stuff
he really didn't want anything at all
he wanted the baby he played the baby and he threw everything else
um this time he's actually picking up more than one thing at a time
and he wasn't doing that before either on when we did the play thing as far as i can remember
okay
he's more interested in the other things and not just because he can put in his mouth
yeah
but he's actually like using the spoon the way it's supposed to be used to feed the baby and
he's playing differently as well
yeah
definitely
wow
that's those are big changes
yeah
it's amazing just a couple weeks how it can make such a change
i know
we don't have any play food at home
i was gonna ask you of these toys do you have um stuffed animals babydolls
no
books
um we have some stuffed animals
we have books
we really only have books like in his bedroom
i have a book downstairs but he never never like plays with it downstairs
when he's in his bedroom and we're sitting in his rocker he grabs for his books and wants me to read to him
okay
are these any of these books um the same as you have at home or similar
um
in other words would he recognize any of these
um we have one that's similar to that fuzzy book
um so
and we have the foot but he that's one of the ones he closes every time i try to read it to him
he has a couple favorites that he wants to read all the time
okay
do you remember what those are
um moo baa
and the other one is a a book similar to that but it's like fuzzy animals
those are the one's he likes to read
it seemed like he liked animals
does he know any animals
we
does he know the names of them or sounds
we have um four cats
so he a lot of times he knows cats and he he makes the sound
my mom has a lot of dogs so he knows doggy
and we we do baby sign with him
and he does this for the sign for doggy
and sometimes he'll sorta kinda bark
and does he know any like farm animals yet or does he do that stuff yet
no not
i mean i started to to show him cows and chickens and sheep um on a computer game that i have but he's kinda slightly interested
i think maybe if they were the real thing he might be more interested
i wanna eventually take him somewhere where there are animals but i haven't gotten to it yet
we went to the zoo when he was really little but that was more for just a moms outing than a babies outing
yeah these experiences kind of change as they get older
yep
um well what kinds of toys do you think are best for his personality
well he likes the babydolls a lot
and it seems like he really likes the food toys a lot
so we might have to be getting some uh play food pretty soon
it seemed like he was playing with several items
do you think he recognizes any of these items
the waffle he
well see we cut it up before we give it to him
so he probably wouldn't necessarily recognize that
same with the bread
we cut it up before we give it to him
i give him like grilled cheese sandwiches
and i give him like cinnamon toast
um the spoon he would recognize
the plate
um
the pizza
no
spaghetti peas any of those
peas maybe
he does he throws them usually
um he doesn't really prefer
he's he's really picky with food
i might have to start trying pizza he might actually eat pizza
he likes dif like he likes a lot of different flavors he doesn't like just plain old chicken
he needs to have chicken with spices and stuff in it
that's unusual
yeah
yeah he's
does he like toys that make noise still
yep
he likes things that he can shake that makes noise
and what else was i looking at
oh the peekaboo um type of book does he like that
um at home he does
but a lot of times if if it's not the two books that he likes the best he likes to clo
but he still he likes to close that book too
so but he we have one peekaboo book at home
it's like a sesame street peekaboo that you lift things up and he seems to be tickled by that
so he really likes the babydolls you said
yeah uh when we go to play group the little girl has babydolls and he's always going after them
that and electronics
it's just interesting most of the kids his age have not don't really go for the babydoll
huh
at all
wow
you're unique
yeah the one the the one baby the the little girl is over a year she's like four thirteen or fourteen months
and she carries around her babydoll and they kind of fight over it
he'll rip it away from her and try to play with it
and i gave him a cabbage patch kid at home
and he he plays with that
he definitely knows what it is
when you say it
yep
and he started kissing him on his own
at home
it looked like he was feeding
yeah he was
and i was like wow
that's amazing
you are amazing
and he's walking already too
you are
wow
look oh my god he just stood up
that that was the first time he's done that
you stood up
he's never stood up without holding on to something
oh my gosh
we need a plaque on the wall
that's funny
parker
he took his first steps in the doctors appointment after he fell from the swing on our front porch
it was the three of us in the swing and the whole swing went
it was a front porch swing
and it he fell backwards wound up fracturing the back of his skull
and then the next day for our follow up appointment in the doctors office he walked for the first time
like coup just like two steps but
there goes the camera
parker
you come to momma
oh yeah
i'm almost done i just need to scan to make sure there's nothing else i missed
and he also likes balls a lot
oh that's another thing because several people have mentioned that and we don't have any but that their children like them
yeah
yeah
he he likes
hey parker
you like ball
look at mommy
ball
ball
what do you like to do with it
um he he he'll like toss it or throw it and you give it back to him he does does it back to you
that's cool
um okay you don't have play food at home but you do have his cabbage patch doll
no
yep
and you talked about recognizing
oh which things do you think interested him the least
well he's scared of that still
okay
um he seemed to be a little scared of the um of this doggy for some reason i don't know if it's that fluff around his neck
um
what are you doing buddy buds
um the books at this point seem to not interest him as much as all the other toys
could be there's so many other choices
i can't believe you
i can't believe you're so silly
alright i think that's all
now i gotta call daddy and tell him the next step
he um he sat up from a laying down position really really early too
he's been ahead of the game on the milestones
wanna play with erica
come on
while i talk to mommy
okay
um has there been anything you've noticed has changed since the last time that you were here
um i think the last time she really liked the doll and this time sh i don't think she could have cared less
about the doll
she was like really into the doll
she was holding her ha and everything
this time she didn't care
so which toys do you think she was most interested in this time
um all the food
the food toys
maybe she's hungry
maybe
could be
i don't know
she was really into the food toys and she loves this gross thing
the hair is gross but i guess its cool it feels cool
um which toys do you think she has the least interested in besides the doll
um like just the little animals in general
she kinda just picked up and threw 
and then
she got into the books at the end
so yeah i would say these stuffed animals
um
does she play with similar toys at home
yeah we have food toys
and um i don't have little stuffed animals really
a couple but not many
but yeah she we play with this these similar ones at home
and any of the books

either our lab or there are three other labs on campus

so what do you think she um liked the most today
she's into food
again
she shouldn't be hungry
she's had enough food
was she into food last time too
she was into some of the food items
a lot of the food items
it was there was more
last time it i mean she was into the pizza again
um
the waffle
the
the cheese she didn't play with the cheese today really
um she was holding the peas can
and
not the peanut but it was i thought it was something else here but
the definitely the peas can
and she was into the biting the spaghetti
oh i think i i at least heard
and she was looking at the cookie and the hamburger
um
but she was playing with that and i mean she plays with the bottle and the cup
but it was like food
is she familiar do you think with the words
yeah pizza she sees she's familiar with
i mean her brothers love pizza
and so we make homemade pizza um
cheese she hears
and we have cheese on the pizza for example
hi
hello
um her brothers like waffles
so that's
yes
they like waffles don't they
waffles
yes
the boys
you know
yes
yes
most mornings the boys are like can i have a waffle
a lot of mornings it's no
but
yes
hi
hi
um
yeah
he liked the peas but i think it was more the shape and the color
he doesn't
he doesn't eat things in that format
is that your babydoll
and she likes the spoons and stuff
she goes into the drawers
hello
hello
sneaky
i'm gonna catch you
you wanna talk to the babydoll
baby
oh that's nice
and i noticed uh you she's not going by you call her not alex but you have like another name or
we have nicknames for her
she goes by alex
or ally
or allyboo
aw
and so she
hi
or like her dad calls her girlyboo
her brothers are the boos
so she's the girlyboo
oh no coughing
she's sometimes occasionally called by her middle name
but
what is her middle name
catherine
oh that's nice
and so
she's getting used to a lot of names
yeah
but she answers she knows it's her
she goes comes running
hi
she is really testing these out she's a
uh what about the books
didn't she interested in anything today
i mean she looked at the um
the one that was
um
where she
maybe am i sitting on it
um no the on the book
she was interested in that
um
and other than just opening and closing the books not really anything
so
like when she was interested in
she wasn't really interested in the animals today
except for she did pick up the zebra
no
has she been in the past interested in the animals on the other visits
the first visit she was into the pooh and the eagle
ah ah ah
because they i thought it was just red
she really likes used to really be into red things
and now it's more like food items
she seems to be
like she's picking up the dish and she's picking up the spaghetti
she did that the last time was eating the spaghetti and was playing with that
the cups and
the different food items
she wasn't interested in the baby the last time at all so this time she sort of looked at the baby
um
do you have babies at home
no
she's the baby
okay
there is a babydoll and but she doesn't and there's a lot of stuffed animals but she nor her brothers have ever really been interested i mean she has like a cow that she sort of walks around with occasionally
no
and tries to nibble on but it's not
that none of them have really
none of them were into um
stuffed animals
particularly i mean
the boys had pacifiers and that was their friend they never really got into them i mean
and alex with play with some of them but
not really much
hi
but now she's playing with 
what do you think um attracts her to the food
i i thought it was the brightness of the colors originally like last week last time
sorry not last week
last time
anything red she went after so she went after the spam
before
and as the hat on the donkey or eagle or the thing
and then
last time she sorta was attracted to food
and i thought well maybe it's food around the house but she was really into the spaghetti
i thought okay it's the red thing again
um or the ice she was into the last time but this time she's more into
sort of food that she sort of sees or eat she's had a little bit of spaghetti at home in the last few weeks for the first time
brothers have the pizza
we have cabinets with cans in it and she goes into the cabinets now and tries to grab the cans
so i think it may be sort of things that she actually sort of recognizes cookie
brothers like cookies
that's interesting
um
do you think when you're talking to her and kind of cheer like uh i don't know saying like propper or social things
do you think she like catches on like
sorry you're welcome things like that
she's starting to like she will nod her head
or um she doesn't say yes or no or anything like that but um
she says hi she says bye
she waves
if you say come here she'll come
um if you'll say you know leave the cat alone then she'll leave sam alone
oh okay
um
she
um
you know goofs off with her brothers when we tell her to stop she generally stops
well that's nice
that's very nice
and did you say at home are you does she enjoy books at home
yeah
yeah
does she like what kind of toys is she playing with home
at home she's playing more with um we have one of those fisher price tables
okay
we have two types
one we have the old fashioned type that doesn't sing or do anything like a leapster and the other one's like the leapster type
so she'll go and the one she plays with more
hi
um
it if you push buttons it'll make music there's like a little book and if you flip the book then it'll play one type of tune if you flip it the other way it'll play a different type of tune
oh cool
and so like one of the book pages you flip and it starts doing the a b c song so she sits there and looks like she's trying to dance and trying to sing to it so you get these sounds that sound like a b c out of her
oh that's really cool
um
so she'll do that
you know she roughhouses with her brothers
ah ah no
excuse me missy
you can't tear up the place
she she explores a lot so this is typical like finding her finding the paperclip and stuff that's
excuse me
yeah
i mean we constantly have to keep things out of her mouth
um
hi
um you know she has you know blocks and things like that in her um
pack and but she more like cruises around the house and looks for things to grab onto
and she has a like a soft book that she flips and will drag it around the house with her that's
oh okay
um like a bath toy
then like
hi yes
she has drawers that she can like pull out and play
and so she takes the kitchen stuff out
oh oopoops
so she does that or um
there's a la we have a lazy susan in our kitchen
oops
and it has all the kids' dishes and plates and cups and
so she'll go in and pull out all the cups and put them on the floor or like pull down all the plates and
they're all over the house or something like that
we have to pick up and wash them and put back
be careful
oh so funny
yeah
so it's sort of
there's i guess there's conventional play like she has like toys
floating around but then she goes through and
ponders
better sense of a word
aw
hey no don't do that
don't do that
it's uh funny one of my girlfriend's daughters got into that phase
like sticking gagging herself and she thought it was so funny
stop
except for when it actually worked and then she was really upset you know
the child you know
oh
she's like oh i didn't like that
no no aw
uhoh
that's dirty you made the spoon dirty
are you laughing about that
are you gonna get it out and bring it back
so i just have a few questions for you
so do you think there have been any changes since the last visit or things she plays with
um yes she plays with this
this kitchen
equipment
these kwitch kitchen toys where before she ignored them
any in particular
any toys in the kitchen
um she likes the measuring spoons
she liked the fake bottle
um
yeah i think the spoons and the bottle
so what toys out of
any of the other categories does she like the best
um she likes this bumble bee
and
what do you think attracted her to it
the colors
definitely
and uh this
spongy texture
for the hair
right
yes
does she have any of these toys at home
no not these exact toys no
obviously she has bottles
and um
the sippy cups but no not the exact toys
so do you think she was attracted to the bottle because shh
it might looks like a real one
yeah
because she tried to suck it
so
right
um
which toys do you think she likes the least
the doll
do you have any at home
no
huh
no baby dolls at home
oh no we don't want the microphone
well we do want the microphone but we can't play with the microphone
are there any of the books
do you have any of those at home or
not the exact books
we have a good night moon but not that version
so what did you say she played with last time
last time she played with the bumble bee a lot
um
and these stuffed animals if i remember correctly
are there anything in the
that you thought she might've recognized
in names of
or even things at home that
you've noticed that she'd recognize
of toys
um
not really
i mean she recognizes bottle i think
um
but the names of toy
she probably recognizes
uh dog
although i don't think i said the word dog
but she probably would recognize dog
cause we have a dog
but other than that no i don't think she would recognize
she may recognize the word spoon
come over here
elenor
where you going
and do you use
does she use things to eat
she tries to
it's not very successful
but she does try
right here
oh
has she started eating any of the foods here
like cookies or
um
yes
but not in the
it wouldn't look like this
it's all
she has waffles but they're all broken up
so i don't know that she would even recognize
what what it looked like
and cookies of course
right
but you
use the names in the house
we do
and everything
what are you doing
i mean she would recognize
if i took the eggo box out she would recognize what it is
definitely
right
she wants to play with you
yeah
she wants to play on me
right
do you guys
when um
i may have missed this question
when you play at home
do you play
uh
what do you play most with
what does she like at home
at home
um
right now she likes her wheely cart
where she can stand and push it
uh and that's probably her favorite
thing right now
but we also have sort of sta
stackable cups
that break apart and go back together
and she likes those
those are probably her favorite things right now
okay
alright
why do you think she likes those
stackable cups
the cups
uh
they're rightly rainbow colored
oh i know
hey
um
and they come apart so she can bang them together
and she ba
she likes to throw them and they roll
nice
so it's multifunctional
i think
right
she's agreeing
she has agreed
well great
i think we've
uh picked apart the discussion
okay
well enough
with what happened and everything
haha ha
hi
you here now
haha
uh huh
okay
so
there
there are going to be a lot of the same questions
sure
haha
im used to it
haha
haha
um
so what was his favorite
um
this genre
uh
any in particular
i wouldn't s in particular
cause he kind of liked to play with
whatever is in his hands
and when he didn't like the
pea on the plate thing
um
but i'm not sure what
how to
classify that
haha hah
you sharing
oh
ha ha
that remind
and you don't want to share
ha haha
haha
that was silly
haha
haha
um
so
does he eat that at home
yeah
ah version of that
he's never seen actual spaghetti and noodles but
like rigatoni noodles but
easier to grab
now you're gonna do it
he definitely eats peas
bread
cheese
okay and you said that
um
some of the things his
older brother might eat
do you think he recognized them
n
i just kind of
try to incorporate brendon
into it cause it's not enough
that he seems him eat ice
hah
yeah
and like for the first time yesterday and
stuff like that so
do you think it has to do anything with the shape of them
i don't know
if the shape or the color
um
i'm not sure
like the texture maybe
an yes
i i definitely think the texture
cause he'll he'll like touch it and then grab it
so and
haha
and that is a pretty cool texture
yeah it is haha ha
um
did you think some of
did you
do you think that
he thought some of the things were real
the bottle
yeah
definitely saw that
haha
oh i know i felt it
and the peas
but um
other than that uh
i don't think so
maybe the cheese
but
and does he uh
use utensils too
no
he's all his hands
i can put it in his hand
and he'll put it aside and use his hands
he's not into that right now
all barbarian boy right now
so you
haha
haha that's what you're saying haha
haha
so you think he might not know what um
no he knows
he just i don't think he has the patience
for it right now
or th the desire
to do it
cause he'll see me
and he'll maybe do one time
and then
doesn't want to do it anymore
with a fork or
there hasn't been much need for a spoon so far
what do you think he got out of those uh stuffed animals
ah um
he'd like to look at 
and touch 
but
neither one of my kiddos really seem into that into stuffed animals
yeah i guess maybe get a little bit older and know what they are before
they see a
i dunno
uh
what about
the other items on the floor
well he was not interested in the books
i know that was different haha
haha
that's a definite personality difference
he does not sit
he moves all the time
so he's definitely all boy
ha just like his older brother
an what about the dog
he actually acted like it was real
um at first and kinda of
and then touched it and think he realized it wasn't and then
got over it
but uh
other than that that's his
in here in this
these sessions is are the only time he's ever
come across it so um
if he gave much thought after he realized it wasn't a
a threat to him
haha
so he doesn't
play with his sisters
that's ours
no
yeah
okay
yep
i know
but no he you know
honestly his toys at home are
balls
and
trucks
and cars
so he likes to do that kind of stuff
roll the ball around and
this
those are action
things so i think he likes those
where are you going
and you used um
ow
buddy that h uh huh
you didn't use it as much with him
but
the
noises that the animals make
yeah
cause that didn't have the opportunity i guess
ta
really
i didn't really want
do you do it
know what to call this
haha i mean it's a dog but haha
do you do that with him at home though
oh sure
yeah
he just wasn't interested today
not today i guess
with them
and we have um
animals at home that are
like this kinda material
that he likes to play with
and he really gets into that
a little more than the stuffed animals
i dunno if he doesn't have like a fantasy
imagination yet
to understand that they represent
but uh he likes those little things a lot
good and what about um
noise
like how does he like
toys with noise
oh yes
the louder the better
and he will laugh
and
just i mean al
i mean wesed call it keepin the beat cause he will just
bang bang bang bang and ha it is so funny
yeah reese
it's usually what he
goes right for
does he
play with yours
with my
the keys
oh yeah
yes
i don't really allow that so much these days cause the teething thing
just everything goes in the mouth but yeah he likes
and he's got
a whole set of keys that are
much more involved than that one
that they play with
um um
words of encouragement again
you used um
you used a few of them here with him
you do the same thing where as
whenever
he does something good
you praise
oh yeah
uh
they just really um
there seems just to help them develop
you could almost see it
you know that they become their the person
they're supposed to be a when you
let know they are doing something
the right way
now do you usually say things or do you
clap
both
it depends on if
if its something that is the first time i've ever seen him do it
then i clap
cause that's like a
a lot of times that's what i'll
a wo you kn just really good
that's try that again
that's really good
and then i just
encourage him if it's something he's done
alright
i think we've asked all the questions
alright
alright
thank you so much
it's a long
hah a long study
i really know how much you guys are doing its is um
haha
twice as long
haha
as but
most but
oh sure
okay
so um
what do you think her favorite thing was to play with today
she's
i tried to get her
she's in this section
this plastic
fake food
haha
ha
section
and which food in particular
uh i dunno
if it was a particular food
she pretty much likes anything that makes noise
does she
generally is banging them together
or
this kind of stuff
i would say
i noticed that too
haha
haha
baby
what's she think about that
that's interesting last time she was really
into that
fascinated by it and this time she's kinda
take it or leave it
ha
does she have any at home
uh not da the hard plastic kind
but the soft
kinds
and she'll lay her in bed and kind of hug it but
she's got a twin brother that
haha
what a thing doll
haha
does she
um do anything with the
the dolls at home
besides just hugging them like
she would with like a real child almost
do you know what i mean
yeah
not yet
i think she's starting to get the potential to be interested in doing some of that
she's starting to mimic
a little bit
but
not
yet
um what was her least favorite
toys or area
eh probably the stuffed animals
cause she real really engage in books
these
are a little over her head
kind of books
but this kind of stuff she'll she'll really
like she she made it through the whole book
and
these guys she just kinda
right
does she have a
touch and feel book
oh yes
and
does she know any of those animals
like do you think the
not that i can tell
i noticed that you um
made the
the animal noises a lot
do you do that a lot at home
do you think she
connects them
i wou you know cow seems to be the one that i
she seems to want to mimic
the sound i'm making
on cow but the rest of them
she points at them and will even kind of outline them
with her hand and kinda circle thems
so she sees them
i dunno
that she knows specifics
but
d
do you um
do you mean the word cow
or the sound
picture
oh like the
the picture of it in in the book
right but she chose to mimic
oh i'm sorry
yeah no that's okay
yeah
um the word cow or what the sound
uh huh no the sound
yes not the not the words
i haven't seen her do that one time
and so you said like the sounds
do you think those sounds are easier maybe for him to say
probably
one syllable
haha
then repeat
what else
your cuttering yourself
now the food
that you said she likes a lot
does she have
toy food at home
no
that's one thing we
we used to have it
for my son
and then
got rid of it after my son and then
had a couple more
hah so we hadn't we just haven't
that's one thing we haven't replaced yet
now
do you feed her like um
sandwiches at home yet
so do you think she would relate
no
uh cause its just recent
just recent
so
no
but i do she does
she is my little observer
and she'll sit there and watch as i make anything
so i do
tell her about it so i dunno what she retains
at all but
and how desserts does she
do you know that
not once haha
has ever had any think
do you think she sees her older brother do you think
no
she doesn't really care
from meat to cracker to
cheerio to anything
she'll eat whatever right now
hah
and
is she
usually utensils
ah she's just starting to get interested in
trying with the spoo with the fork
hand me a little
plastic fork she's not
you know great but
yeah she's showing interest in doing that
to hold it and try
and
do you use a lot of words of encouragement
at home
yes
cause i noticed you saying some here
yeah
haha
definite
definitely
can you give some examples
well i
tell her when she's doing something right
um
like if i say sela can you do this
and she does what i say i'm
good job and then uh
when she a little personal
she's excited about something that she did
you know
acknowledge just anything really that
is positive for her
and want her to know
that's great
and what did she play with last time
what was her same
the same
exact e um
she really
was into the books last time too but this doll seemed to dominate
everything
last time for some reason
so no stuffed animals any of the last few times
hunhunh
not at home either
yeah
she's just not it really
other than her little doll in her bed but
and we have them
everywhere
do you think she prefers the books over
toys or at home
toys over books
that's really hard to say
cause she's really content in whatever
is being done at the moment
so she'll
stay and do whatever she's doing for a while
and then can move and stay
so i i can't really say that i
i see a preference
i think probably the toys
just cause it's more practical for her to by her on her own
i have to be engaged in the books
you know so
i guess in that regard
and do you have any of those
and you don't have any of the books except something like a touch and feel
oh no i have the other ones
oh you do
uh huh oh yes yeah
well i have but
she's more interested in
chewing on the book and moving it around
than actually engaging
in it
alright i think we're done
alright good
haha
i think she's about done
and her initials are
s
what was her last what's her last name
e
e s
i just didn't have the sheet with me
so i i didn't i couldn't i didn't know what her initials were
oh sure
her initials are s e
i believe she's participant five two four four
but i'm not positive
what you do you think she was most interested in today
well i'd say the peas and the dog
was there any particular dog that she liked
the the one with the pink collar
yes
that and th do you think um that there's any reason that she likes peas in particular
she loves peas
okay
i mean definitely of this food the peas would be the thing that i think she would recognize as something she eats at home
and she loves them
so
i don't know
maybe that's it
they look
i mean they're kinda realistic relative to the others
right
and um she tries to eat them so
they do look more foodlike
yeah
was she interested at all in any of the other
she there was a little milkshake that she was interested in from time to time
and she tried talking on the cheese like it was a cellphone
and um she looked at other stuff
she liked the pitcher
um she like tried put things inside the pitcher
i thought there were some measuring spoons here
oh yeah she looked at the measuring spoons
she liked to shake those
hi
does she play with anything similar to these things
like especially the food items at home
she has a little picnic set
it's plush so i think tactically it would be very different
and i'm not sure she would recognize the similarities
you know what i mean
to me or you it's like fake food
but but i think it's it's very different from the plastic stuff
right
yeah yeah
okay so does she have anything like play dishes or plates or just the just the
she she has some play dishes
i mean she has her own dishes that are plastic
that are similar to these but just a little bit bigger
that she plays with
yeah
oh does she have any babydolls at home
she has one very small one that's more similar to these than that one
she got kind of scared when
did she
i mean not really but but she had the bottle and i was trying to show her that the bottle belonged to the baby and she was not pleased with that
not pleased huh
did she think it was hers do you think
i think she did
i think she did
i think she sees the babydoll as threatening
um
that's really interesting
it's almost as big as she is you know
she's small for her age
and that's a big doll huh
that's a big doll
and you were giving it to someone else
yes
um let's see
i just want to make sure
one other thing that i thought was funny
was that she liked all the stuffed animals
but she definitely recognized that that little brown one with the pink furry thing as a dog
and she um she howled at it
which my husband taught her to howl with the dogs
so she was like communicating with the little dogs
so she must have known that was a dog
yeah
i think so
i think so
that's interesting
yeah
it doesn't look that much like a dog
well not that much
four legs
it has the four legs
and we have yorkies at home who are really small and
got it
yeah
got it
see here
heidi where'd you shoe go
does she express any interest in books
yeah
she she did
she likes books
she loves them at home but i think there were so many other distractions here but
she liked this one
and she loves the pet and feel book
she has some of those at home
so have her interests changed since she was here
i know she was here pretty recently
i don't think so
i mean i think they probably change a little bit day by day
you know just what her mood is and what's more interesting in that moment
but um but i wouldn't say that her interests have changed really
she's i noticed that she's maturing very quickly it seems to me
like she's developing quickly and is able to do things that wasn't able to do and is more expressive and communicative
and is better able to let me know what she wants
but i don't think her wants are really different from what they've been
they're just she's better able to
to express them
do you think she's playing differently than she was with the toys
um i don't remember well enough to to say really
if she was you might remember
yeah i mean i think maybe last time we had a little bit more success just reading books all the way through
and now she was just a little more interested in everything else that was going on around
she seems like she got to all the groups
yeah she did
yeah
she did
so you read a little bit to her with the book that she picked out
yeah we almost finished that one
and we got about half way through the peekababy book
and i think that's it
so there was some interest
yeah yeah
at home when we read we you know sit down in a chair and read through four books at a time
and she's she's really into it
but but you know it's not in an environment like this where she gets to choose what she wants to do
right
uhoh
shoes
shoes are off
i think that's it
unless there's anything that you noticed that i didn't ask you about
i don't think so
so cute
say thank you
so next time she's gonna be two
two
you're gonna be practically a grown
i know
here i'll just that off so you can take it off
practically a grown
thanks
say hi
so what would you say were her favorite was
the baby and the ice cone which actually were her the same favorite toys from the last time we were here
that's funny
yeah
does she have these those toys at home or any others
um we have play food
we have uh wooden play food so it's just different
um
and we have babydolls but they're in her sister's room so she doesn't usually play
and she n it's funny the past three times we've been here she never goes near these toys and her two year old sister has like a whole collection of them and loves them and doesn't let her touch them and even like alone when i try to get her to play with them she's like no
i'm like afraid to go there
so
which of these toys does her sister have
um
she has
i mean she has a lot of toys just you know small ones like that but she has the sea other and
she has a pink poodle it's not exactly the same
she has a fox like this
and then she just has she has like a different frog but like similar toys
um
i think just in general she tries to steer clear of this
for that
yeah
which of these foods has she seen before
she's had everything
she's she eats pretty much whatever we eat for dinner now so
yeah so anything that's there she's eaten
does she like a lot does she like these ones
she loves peas
she likes ice
yeah
you love it
um i don't know if she'd recognize that we usually give her shredded cheese
or cut up in really tiny that's only the thing other thing i would say is that usually when she does eat everything's cut up really small so
okay
like the spaghetti wouldn't look like a pile like that for example
yeah um
i know she looked at these books
she we have a bunch of other caring cats books that she really likes
um and we do a lot of reading with her but we don't have any of these exact books except we have a lot that
the so which of the animals has she seen
she's seen all of the animals in this book
she actually does she didn't do it today but she does make several of the animal noises
at home when we read her animals books like she'll do a cow and a sheep
oh
um what else
she'll do a duck
so
she just didn't wanna do it today
yeah
um let's see what about these
i know she does she play with yours
yeah
she does she loves mine
mine or like my phone
anything that's like not really a toy like she likes all these better than like the knockoff toy version
um yeah so anytime she can get a hold of my keys she likes to play with those
um let's see
does she she played with those two or is that
i kinda pulled those out and tried to get her to see like would she do it i was wondering that after the past couple times if she'd play with these kinda toys if her older sister wasn't around and she was kind of like wasn't feelin it
either not interested or like conditioned to know not to touch those
and it's not like i don't let her play with them at home but just the second she gets them her sister like rips out of her hand
right
no matter what i try to do so
right
what about this one does she eat a lot of these
not too many cookies but she does have um
or how this
she'll eat pizza too yeah
corn
she eats everything
she does eat everything
yes she does
um well she has ten teeth too she has molars so
wow
um so she probably eats things that other kids her age might not be eating because she has the tooth capacity to do it
right
you gonna give that baby another big kiss
let's see does she have like toy food and everything
yeah
yeah we have like a little play kitchen and then a lot like i said most of our toys are wooden or we have felt food too
that she plays with
huh
where's that baby goin
how about has she been on a farm or to a zoo and seen these
yeah we got to the zoo my parents have a farm
with horses and chickens and
bees
pheasants bees
oh
pheasants
um so she gets you know she gets that and we were just at a petting zoo last week down in south carolina
come on
yeah
so
um and we just tend to do a lot of like animal books and when we do shows she watches a lot of animal shows and
right sweetie
um do you wanna fill this out now
sure i can
is that okay if she keeps playing okay
sure yeah
okay
here's a
oh there's one there
okay thanks
so compared to with like past visits this is your third session right
like what was different that like the toys she took interest in as opposed to other past ones
she took a little bit more interest in the baby than in the past but
she pretty much just likes the plastic food
um which items in particular was she pretty interested in
uh definitely the bottle and the sippy
does she have like items in her environment at home that are similar to that do you think that's why or
yeah she was drinkin some juice in a bottle on the way here
um
i noticed like kind of just a little bit from what i've heard like you tend to were like be like into different like actions or positions emphasize that is there any in particular like she likes to how like you play at home or
she likes to be upside
and she likes to be tickled
they she's very active and so we
we let her be active
that's good
she looks like she was having fun with it
um are any do anything of these toys like fit her her personality well at this stage or
oh you like that bottle
pretty much anything she can get her mouth on is all that she likes right now
yay
come on stand up
no you wanna be upside
ah you singing
singin us a pretty song
uhoh
does she have um have any like plastic food at your ha home
or stuffed animals or anything
we've got a couple of stuffed animals but she's never shown any interest
except to chew on them
more a food person
and she's got most of the toys that she has at home are hard plastic they're not food but they're hard plastic toys
similar or anything
what are did you notice any difference in how she interacted the food like
i know some kids will like bang stuff together and i don't know stuff like that
this was the first time she's re definitely recognized that as a bottle this time
she always put it the nipple in into her mouth
um
she still banged it with the other things but
she knew what it was
okay
she's funny
hello
yeah pretty much
is that silly
so there wasn't really any other food besides like the bottle or the sippy that she paid much attention to
no
not really
she likes that
that's gotta hurt
that's gotta hurt baby
i know there's carpet
we've got progo at home so there's a lot of padding compared to that
you like the keys
yeah
mkay
have you noticed her language are into like after doing these sessions like do you think she like remembers anything from them for the next time she comes back or
i don't know
she hasn't really
well she might've remembered the clock
she liked pulling things off of it last time
yay
well i would these things
you wanna be upside again
okay
she's like a diver or something
you sure are squirmy
yeah
kay well i think that's it then
you ready to go baby
yeah
thank you so much for coming
no problem sorry i was late
it's fine
she was here last
about a month
okay
so do you notice any differences overall
on how she's playing or what she's interested in
um she's a lot more interested in containers
in and out
um
she will actually help clean up now on her own
which is really helpful
i don't know if that says something about me or
um
but she likes to do that
she likes building toys
um
much more into cause and effect um kinds of things
um
the the little shape the little popper with the animals
where you push the different things
she can't quite work that part yet
but she knows that when we do it the little things pop up
and she likes to put the faces back down so we'll pop them back up
uh what else do you like aoife
she actually realy likes puzzles now
um and very much over the past month has gotten into she liked sitting and reading before
but now she will go get books for us to read to her
instead of us sitting down saying okay we are gonna read a story
she'll you know get books out of the little basket and come find us with it
so you said she does have favorites
yeah
okay what kind of books are those
um
there's an abc book that she likes because her dad sings it to her
um
thank you
um she has a couple books with baby faces that she likes
um the eric carle book from head to toe
because we do the actions with it
and she will do some of them to mimic us
um
a couple of like the sandra boynton books that we've just been reading forever
so she knows the pictures she knows the story
she'll actually nod you know after you've finished a page like yes you've said it correctly and then turn it
um
but she its actually a pretty wide variety of books that she likes
she likes um you know the ones with the real animals that you can touch
um
pretty much everything
um
but she does like the ones especially that we have downstairs
where we have to you know sing or do an action or
so interactive types of study
yeah
and she is unbelievably active
all the time
yeah she
i don't have much of a comparison but
she does seem active
i mean they all are at this age to some extent
but um she's very curious about the other things going on
yeah
she wants to and she's she always has been interactive with other people
she really likes other babies and really likes people um
you said she's more interested in you than she is in the toys
by far
yes
mom said that right
um so then how about babydolls is she interested in faces like that
not particularly
not so much
um she has started to like um
a hug
um she has started to like her sorta stuffed animals more
she will take a teddy bear and hug it
um she'll try to give it her bottle
um but more of the teddy bears than the babydolls
the babydolls she's just kinda
how about little um you said a number of
does she know any of those names for those kinds of animals
um she knows duck
she knows pig
she knows cat
she knows dog
um i would guess she knows frog
um cause she will actively seek out if there is a frog in a picture
she will actively seek out and make sure she touches the frog
um
i guess she knows bear
so
there's some very unusual ones in here and i wouldn't think that most kids would know some of them
there's the frog but um you found some of the
the donkey and the groundhog yeah
yeah
yeah of course mommy picked the strange ones
or they they they don't come up as much for you
yeah
that's right
you do know hippopotamus though
well the the stories but not the hippopotamus
so she's actually heard that word a number of times
where ya goin
how about the food items
is she eating foods like any of these kinds of foods
um she eats peas
she loves peas
um she eats cheese
she eats bread
um she eats waffles though she didn't go after that all
um she's never had an m and cookie but she will have animal crackers
um
pretty much all veggies
she doesn't like spaghetti which i think is odd
but she does love berries
which you know the strawberries and the raspberries are bright red
she sees something red i think and immediately thinks it might be a berry
got your scarf
uh huh um
keep you warm
lets see um
she did play with
bring it over
bring it over
food items she did sorta was interested in those today
yeah
okay
and again although we asked for some for christmas she didn't get any
so
okay
yeah
we've probably asked you in the past if she has
i know you said she has stuffed animals and books
does she have any of these types of things
nope we don't have any of these kinds of things
although she um a couple of babydolls um although we have started
thank you should mommy put that on
okay no didn't even look huh
um
thank you for bringing that over
they're so
um we have started having her eat off of instead of just kind of just putting it on trays plates and bowls
um so she's now more familiar with plates and
she picked em up
has she had i know she was playing with these
has she had any ice cream cones
no
or any ice cream
she's had like a piece of like a popsicle but that doesn't look anything like the
it doesn't look no
this is we only really if she had one
yeah
okay
she's had pizza crust
and
you found your book aoife good memory
either that or it's by chance but regardless you found it
okay i think i might have covered everything i need to ask you
okay
um
when she comes back for her two year old visit there will be a different set of toys which will be nice
okay
and um
okay
oh okay
i think we'll have him stop
just ask
you get to keep playing
hi
oh
um
i don't know if you can remember this is your
second
third
third
third already
yeah
um
which of
which of these toys did he seem interested in um
this time
uh he likes the
the spoons
the measuring spoons and the cup
and the
the bottle over there
um
he
he seems more interested in these two now
then before
this soft
stuffed animals
that's a chicken
um
why do you think that these
um interest him
um
i think
the cup
and the spoon
and the bottle
cause he's drinking on his own now
um
um
so maybe
just the fact that he can do it on his own and
he does it
um
and he's teething
he likes to put stuff in his mouth
too
uh
what about
which group do you think he's least
interested in
maybe the books
he didn't really touch 
i had to like bring one over to him
and uh
so the books
so
um
do you guys read
books at home
yeah
yeah
we try to at least
at least once a day
but at home he's always like
playing with them even if i don't read it to him
right
he always has a book and he's flipping through it
okay
so maybe
the other toys are new
so ha
okay
so would you say he's still
into toys more
or
books
into the toy
into
oh does he
does he like
prefer books or the toys
toys
toys
uh huh
um
do you
do you think he recognizes any of the animals
um
or the names of
maybe
does he know
maybe yeah dog
he says dog a lot
and we have a dog
and
whenever we have a
whenever the dog barks he says
dog
okay
not exactly dog
but you know
as much as he can
but
i think that's his main
animal right now ha dog ha
um
what about the foods
the food
recognize any
um
not really
i don't think so
okay
maybe just the drinks inside the cup
i mean
that
he knows what it's for that there's
something inside
to drink
um but we don't like eat ice cream on a cone
i guess usually in a cup so
and the cheese i usually like
tear it up for him
so it doesn't look like this to him
the same with like the bread
right
so
he he doesn't see these
the this food in this whole form
it's usually like chopped or
pureed so
o
um
thank you this is pizza
pizza
what about dolls
i guess
how many dolls or i guess he wouldn't have haha
yeah his sister does so
he plays with dolls at home
okay
so he he knows what dolls are
alright
what is this
that may be a beaver
pretend food at home
yes
you do okay
um
okay i think that's it
unless is there anything else
you want to add or talk about
about the way he plays at home
um
not really no
okay
nothing i can think of
this is a kangaroo
haha you want to kiss him
thank you
okay yup
let's go get your sister
is it okay if i ask you some things
please
ask us some questions
so what do you think she liked the most
the food still
she still hasn't
really gone near anything
besides the food
like all three visits
she just loves the food
i don't know
she likes to eat
um do you have the stuffed animals
we have stuffed animals at home
we have books at home
we have those some of those books at home
um we have play food
but it's been put in the basement
since before christmas
the christmas tree went there
um
but she really
like she went right for the pizza
the first thing
she played with the you know like
she hasn't touched a nonfood item practically
since we've been in here
she played with a little while seal
a little bit
i even brought
the baby over
cause you said sometimes they like the baby
she gave the baby a bunch of stuff
oh well that's good
yeah she's she's that giving
i give it to you and then you give it back to me
and then i give it to you and then you give it back to me
so we're we're at that phase
but um she still seems to have no interest for anything else
besides the food
does she do you think she recognizes um the name
as familar with some of the names of the food
i don't know
i know she eats peas
at home um
but we don't feed her pizza
so i don't know
she's eaten spaghetti
she seems to like the spoo
which she gets spoons at home
um but she doesn't drink juice at home
so it's food but not food that we i guess normally would eat
or that she would normally eat
she eats cheese at home
but she didn't touch the cheese
she eats a lot of bread
she loves bread
but didn't really touch the bread either
and she does love keys
but who doesn't
who doesn't love keys
does she play with your keys
no
they're pretty away
oh
she has her own keys to play with
well my keys are lost in the car right now
but someplace at the police impound lot
oh
so
um ye
we're gonna go back when it's warmer and look for again
you doing so good
you such a big girl
yeah
do you wanna play with something else
no
you like that spo
yeah
what's going on
is she playing with dolls at home
no
nope
she's got stuffed things at home
one kind of looks like a doll
but no
she plays mostly with blocks
and cars
and um books
she does play with the books more at home than she does here
um
we have some that have pictures of babies in them and she seems to like those a lot
she likes to put everything up to her head
like it's a telephone
oh
that's kinda funny
but yeah mostly it's blocks
she really likes blocks
and she likes to pull things out of stuff
so like all the toys are in a big bin
and she'll sit there and she just pulls out
she likes to take out and then sometimes she'll put back in
but um
doesn't matter what's in the bin
she just pulls it out
and she loves um magnets right now
so she discovered that she could take the magnets off the fridge and she could put on the dishwasher
or if they come off the fridge and you put back on the fridge
oh
so we're at a
the magnet you know
would like a magnet
do you like it
but she likes the magnets
you do
are you um doing kind of like you know does she know
does she know kind of like
no
we haven't been doin that yet
we haven't
we're tryin to get some of the sign language going
now i mean i can kind of move my arm a little more now
we were staring before the accident
and now we're we're trying to start back up again
cause we did it with nathan
yeah
i don't know if it helped at all
but we did it with him
oh okay
oh now we're going to make a mess
oh yeah
ye
oh she's happy while we're talking
she's she's very good at playing independently you know
she'll be happy to sit with a pile of stuff
and play with it
where nathan didn't like to do that
so i don't know if it's cause you're second or cause you're a girl or cause you're just different
i don't know
i don't know
do you think um does is she eating out like using a spoon or just um
no
i mean she'll hold onto it
but she can't use it yet
but she's self feeding with just fingers
so she likes to do it herself
so she likes cubes of cheese
pieces of banana um
we've done rice kind of mushed up
anything that she can pick up
cooked carrots and pieces um
she like peas a lot she can pick up
and then you know
she'll change her mind
and decide that she doesn't want anymore peas anymore ever
does she pick up each individual pea
or do you
okay
it takes like forty five minutes to eat a meal
yeah
and she eats like four meals a day
oh
so that's a long time
we're in the high chair a long time
and she eats each bi
and then she plays a little bit
and then she eats a little more
and then she plays
where'd it go
oh no
oh no
that was ama
do you wanna go get it
you can go get it
she's ni
she's nice lady
you can go get it
yeah
i'll help you
i'll help you come on
you can go
i'm helpin you
come on
you have to take a step
come on
you can do it
there you go
okay one more step
oh oh wow
what a big girl
what a big girl
you such a big girl
yeah that was excellent
that was ex
and she's
getting teeth so her appetite's a little different now
she wants it a little blander
so
like lots of just plain bread
plain bread
plain bananas plain plain
did she play with the bread here
no she didn't and that's what's really weird
she loves bread
loves bread
is this how she sees it
yeah pretty much
i mean we we kind of tear it up into little pieces
but she knows like when you get a piece of bread she knows
alright
and uh she won't um
she won't eat anything else
if she sees you go for the bread
she will not eat anything else until she gets that piece of bread
so
bread muffins noodles anything carbohydraty
granola bars um
it's just like those oatmeal cinnamon bars kind of thing
loves those
thank you
did you put the pizza on the plate
it's upside down
is she eating cookies
even the like not so much like cookies but
she eats cookies
yeah good she didn't touch 
i don't know if we had shown her the m and cookies
but she would i would that she would recognize the shape
and the size are similar
yeah i know
oh whoopsies
whoopsies what you doing
that's the floor
yeah
there you got a plate
we don't give her plates yet
okay
then things just kind of end up on the floor
what do you think she's
yeah
liking about these plates here
i don't know
maybe she she likes anything really that she can pick up
if she can pick it up
she likes it
what you doing
you being all crazy
did you lose your binky
yeah she does like to pick things up
she likes
um do you think that she um knows what her binky is
oh yes
the name binky
she knows what it is
i don't know if she knows the name
but she knows
if she sees it and she wants it she makes it very clear
you like that spoon
where you goin
this is a new thing too
she crawls and carries it
and you said she kind of just holds the spoon
yep
when she's eating
she can
we normally don't let her though
it gets messy
hate to say it but a lot of things that she could do
she doesn't do
they're just too messy for mommy
yeah you having fun
ye
she likes to hit
did she play with the measuring spoons too
she didn't today
did you play with those
do you want to go look at the measuring spoons
yeah what do ya think
they make noises like key
what are you doin
oh gotta get that spoon
here let's get the measuring spoons
mommy's gonna get the measuring spoons
oh it's over here
yeah let's get these
what do you think of these
what do ya thi
those are exciting
where you going
what are you doing
so the last time she played with food as well
yeah she's played with food every time
ev time
and the first time i tried really hard to show her everything
did you say though um the last time that you had purchased a food kit
we've already we've had one but it was in the kitchen
and that's she wasn't really crawling yet so i moved it from the kitchen to the living room
she seemed to like playing with it here
but then christmas came and then i took it out of the living room completely
so she hasn't really had access to ours
um
again mostly at our house she plays with the blocks
and the trucks
and um
anything that's inside of her like bin
rattles keys and again she doesn't really play with the item
she takes it out she kind of looks at it she puts it down
she'll pick it up she'll put in back in kind of thing
it's an out and an in thing
there we go
what's over there
huh what's over there
yeah
uh-oh you dropped your spoon
can you get it
that's very good
i think
oh no she didn't get it i thought she got it
there you go
good j
yeah
so i'm trying not to at her
but it'll be interesting to see what she does when she's two years old
yea
when she comes back and
well that's um next visit right
um
we might have a different phone number then
would you like my cell phone number
yeah do we not have that on file
i have no idea
okay
but it's nine seven three
five eight zero
okay
um i'm just gonna ask you a few questions
okay
um so uh which of the toys do you think seemed to interest her the most
um she liked the measuring to shake the measuring spoons and the the keys
do you guys do you play with those at home
why do you think that interested her
actually uh i think she likes them they make noise
you can shake 
um uh and which toys do you think she likes the least
stuffed animals
and why do you think that is
does she play with stuffed animals at home or
um not a lot
and most of the stuffed animals she has a at home are are bigger too
um which foods would you say she was the most attracted to
um the waffles
um she picked those up right away
and then the cookies
um and what about the books do you do you think she's interested in them or
um when we first came in she went straight to the books first
and then she got distracted by the other stuff
and is there anything here that um she's never seen before or does she have all this stuff at home
we don't have any play food at home
or baby or or baby dolls like this
she just has like um they're kinda like stuffed animal baby dolls
they don't really look real
um do you that might be why she was not as interested in these
well yeah and she once i showed her how to do i guess do the bottle and the cup she tried to feed the baby a little bit
she thought that was interesting
okay and do you um normally like read these books to her at all
has she ever seen these before
um
she was not interested in them
no we don't have i don't think any of these books at home
we have i guess the regular good night moon
but no we don't have any of these specific books at home
okay do you think she recognizes the names of anything
um she knows dog
she she might know baby
but she might think that's herself
hey
she's so funny
um so she likes to play with the fake food at home too
we don't have any fake food at home
no she's a little bit young for it still
does she she doesn't eat waffles at home right
no she doesn't
no
she she really doesn't eat much of any of this at home
okay well i think that's all the questions that i have
do you have any questions
i think that's it thank you so much for coming in
i love her hair
i know she's a little poofball puffball
and the earrings too
she had swim class this morning so she had to have a bath
oh so cute
you stacking up
its her new favorite thing is stacking
alright
so i'm ask you some questions
okay
so um what do you think she liked the most today
the pizza
the play food yeah
oh
she definitely liked that
and the ice cone
she kinda tried a little bit of everything
she did
yeah
ye
is it um different from last time or the last two times
no i think it's pretty much similar
from what i remember
was uh the pizza her favorite last time or
i don't know if she had a particular last time i can't remember
and she always likes stuffed animals
and she's been playing a lot more with her books at home
so it's we kinda think it's funny she just sits there and read but er flips the pages
so do you have any books like that at home
yeah we have all these kinda
that's why i put that up
she was gonna rip that one
all the these uh board books kinda
and anything doctor seuss
yeah we have a lot of books
right erin
do you have one like that
yeah
that's why she we have two like that one and that's why i picked i knew she'd like that she plays
she will go through her bin at home and pull that like there's toys and stuff but she'll pull that book out
because of the
she can feel everything
juice
you didn't see that one huh
and everything must go in her mouth
that's
um let me think
does she eat any of those foods
um y she i mean she li she will have pizza but yeah
um
i haven't really ventured out much more than
basic foods with her so
does she do you think she recognizes it or no
no i think it was just the right size to go into her mouth and the right you know
plastic chewing
but the um baby bottle she recognized she right away and tha the juice cup right there which she's play with now but yeah she knew that this was a you know a bottle
do you have a babydoll at home
she has soft babydolls
not one like this but she has little soft ones
does she ever try to feed the baby or
i know you were trying to do it
no
no she's never
i i'm laughing because we have a lit she has a walker thing that's a stroller
and we put the babydoll in there but li she prefers to walk the dish towel
so she will grab the dish towel and put it over the
so i don't think she knows or her she has like a little um stuffed rabbit
that's like a little blank and she'll walk that
but that's what she sleeps with every night so that's her connection
well that makes sense
yeah
so it's either lovie or the dish towel
that's funny have you started using utensils
shh i mean we feed her with a spoon but she doesn't use anything she uses just her hands
so you don't think she would recognize the spoon
she probably would recognize the spoon yeah
but she wouldn't gravitate towards it
no i don't know if she saw it to be honest with you
i mean i think there's a lot here
yeah
see somethin
i knew you were going
so um what kind of stuffed animals do you have at home
are they similar
um yeah we have um we had a huge winnie the that she
well it's huge it's about the size of her that she likes
um like her little stuffed rabbit blanket she loves
and any i mean any you know at christmas time i had a ton of little holiday bears and
she'll find them and pull them down and she gives th like hugs
she loves stuffed animals yeah
and we have those like learning ones those like leapfrog ones
there's one that actually says her name and stuff so she has that she likes that one too
you're silly
what are those
yep
everything in the mouth
um i noticed she was banging things around
yes that's her she'll shh yeah i mean we ha you know she got blocks for christmas and so it's just you know constant
right
is that what you do
anything to make noise
yeah
like that
um i also noticed that you were saying the colors of things
do you do that often are you trying to teach her or
yeah
yeah definitely trying to teach her so
anything we can
does she gravitate towards one particular
i don't think so
is her room in particular
yes
it's obnoxiously pink
and lime green and all pastels
oh that's cute
so i'm trying to put a little more purple into her
yeah right so you're not too pink
so do you play games like um pattycake or like
yes
yes
she loves peek a
with that same dish towel
she will go and grab it
and uh
she loves to pla and sometimes she'll just pl we'll catch her by herself playing
so we go over and play with her so she she gets a that's her favorite
that's cute
yeah
yeah
that's the babydoll
say hi baby
hi baby aw you give the baby a hug
that's quite a hug
and um what kind of words of encouragement do you use like um
do you clap a lot or do you say like yay
we clap and say go erin
yeah we clap or we do like a little dance for her
and so she'll start doing her
yeah right yay erin
that's good
yeah and she knows it
that's
that's good
that baby's kinda heavy for ya huh
it is a big baby
it's really
i don't know why we have such a big baby in here
i know it's like the size of her
hello baby
okay so i wasn't with you guys the last time
thank you again
what toys was he most interested in those times
last time
the baby and the books
yeah yeah
i think i don't know if he did the keys or the spoons too
and this time what would you say was most attention to
um the baby and the book
um i mean he paid attention to the keys after i picked them up
but he kept going back on his own to the baby and the book
why do you think that is
well um um his sister has baby dolls
and she doesn't exactly let her him play with them
so maybe the availability
on the other hand he um he um stays with another baby about about about um six six months old seven months old
and he always seeks the infant out if he's awake at the house
you know he'll he'll go go to him and try and touch him and stuff
so it might be that he's you know um just like a playmate or something
first time i've seen him um interact with like something a baby item you know like this
and bring it near the baby doll and um maybe that was just an accident that
and the ice cone
i don't know if he knows what an ice cone is though
i'm not sure if he's trying to feed the baby or just like hey look or let me hit you on the head with this object
okay so do you think he might be starting to recognize
i think with the bottle he's starting to recognize because he does spend two mornings a week with a baby who um will take a bottle and and eat
um do you read books at home
we read books
do you have any of these same books
we have um good night moon i think
and we have some doctor seuss but we don't have this particular one
and we have a a touch you know book
but we don't have that particular one
would you say he prefers book over toys or toys over books
oh that's hard
they seem to be equally interesting to him
um i would say maybe toys a tiny bit more
he can manipulate them better you know
this this i don't see a frustration level with toys
oh like if he wants to open the page and it's not quite happening
then he'll get frustrated and then turn around to something else
but i've not seen him frustrated with a toy
like he doesn't expect i don't know i guess he doesn't expect this to do anything
i know you mentioned that his sister has dolls
are there any other dolls that you have at home
um we have lots of stuffed animals
um i don't see any exact ones
but you know we have like similar like doggies like this
we have a winnie the
um he doesn't play very much with stuffed animals at home
um even when i hand them to him
he kinda like looks at it for a while and then he goes
which is interesting
um
maybe we can cut down on them huh
um he likes he seems to like things that make a noise
like um a little crunchy noise
or rattling noise or
um and then ah i don't know what he likes about books
maybe the surprise of what's gonna you know what is he gonna see when he opens the page
okay i think that is all that we have for you today
um did you notice anything different from this time what she plays with this time from last time
um she played with no i don't think she really played with much
kinda wandered around and did her thing
please don't rip that off
last time were there some things that
um
what was her favorite thing
last time you were here
she always goes to the food i mean like the sippy
she took the sippy she took the cookie and she took the bottle and tried to eat and drink out of them
um and i think that's been pretty consistent with her
um last time she played a little bit with the stuffed animals this time she kind of threw went through them and then threw them to the side
do you think there were any stuffed animals that she played with that she recognized the names of
um i don't think so yet
or if she does nothing that i i noticed
okay so everything was kind of like new new names or
i mean she you know like the she picked up the fox and i don't know if the fox looks a little like her cat
oh okay
but that was when she was going through that's who she went to grab
yes tha you
so like familiar face colors
ye
um what about the you said the food do you think she knows the names of some of the food
i think the cookies and the bottle and the sippy and the juice ye
okay these are more familiar to her
did you guys play with books this time
i tried she played a little bit and she looked through it but not not as much i mean
usually at home she'll grab a book and walk around and sounds like she's trying to read it but
she didn't really play too much with the books
she i have no idea if she likes the colors of this or what but this she grabbed
do you think she knows the name
of the clock
ye
probably not
okay ye it could be color
she'd no interest in the baby
did you try to play with the baby
i tried i tried to get her to feed the baby and no interest in the baby
do you have baby dolls at home
she does have a two some she'll walk around with them
she just carries them is there is she is that how she plays with them
ye she'll just carry right now um
she you know sometimes looks like she's going to give the baby a kiss or a hug but
i don't know if she really is or
amira
are there any other um oh are you working on is she is she using words now
she doesn't the only things she says is she says daddy and then she calls cat jazzy
and then otherwise it's nonsense words
okay great
there's nothing in there for you to drink
i thought there were some words that you were working on
tryin you know like i'll when she gives me something i'll say thank you and she'll mumble but she doesn't say thank you back she'll just mumble
like you know like a two second something back so just tryin to get her to at least be familiar with the stuff with the words
ye
but no she's not much of a no actual formed words really
it's still pretty much baby
hold o
um so you said the animals that names weren't familiar was the fox was just it was like just the look
i wonder if it was just the look ye
i'm not sure she knows
do you play games like patty cake or
she plays patty cake and will play um like i'll chase her or she'll you know like i'll hide and we'll creep up on each other
okay do you say boo or peekaboo or
i'll do you know like i'll come up and say boo or just to scare you know like she knows i'm coming and she'll jump like she's scared
ye
even though she sees me running towards her
tha you
tha you
tha you
you can't drink out of that though baby
uh what kind of books at home do do you have
she has um she has the hard cover of these little books and what she rea likes that i've been buying her are pop books
so i have um a bunch that are just you know in the jungle in the ocean
she'll sit and go through the pop books
okay
so i thought i could get her to do this one it's you know kind of interactive
but not really
she wasn't
ye
super interested
no but her pop books she loves
has she been eating uh food
like like solid food
ye
any of the ones that were here
she'll eat like the greens i mean she picked up the peas
she eats a lot of green veggies
um and then like pan and she picked up the waffle like she'll do pancakes and crackers and you know any type of bread stuff like that
okay and is she familiar with winnie the
i'm not sure um no i don't think so not yet
she doesn't watch you know like i don't she doesn't watch winnie the or anything like that
no winnie the yet
right
was there anything in here what was her least favorite thing
here today
i'm gonna have to say the doll
how much time do you think do you spend playing with the doll
she wouldn't like i said she wouldn't even play with it i picked it up and tried to get her interact and she had no interest
and then her favorite thing
she would um i'm gonna say the sippy
she walked around with that and oh the little clock not that she knew how to play with it
she walked around
but the sippy she kept trying to drink out of
do you think what are um like the characteristics of toys that she really likes at home
um she has now she's getting into the stage where she you know like has um like
the little animal doll characters then they have their vehicles and a train and she'll sit and she'll actually drive you know like start to push them around and drive then the ball that she plays with
that she'll throw around or kick
okay so more active toys
ye
i don't see her do any roleplaying yet
but she's all i mean she's back and forth all over with toys
the uh animal the animal farm toys you bought that just before your second visit
right
ye i've had i've been collecting them for a while
oh okay
and before i mean she before she wouldn't really do anything with them like she would grab you know walk around with them if she'd want them but now i noticed she's started to put them in the little vehicles and push the vehicles around
that's cool
so startin to get there
so things that are more immobile do you think she's attracted to things for color or touch or like texture
um or sound like what
she really likes the sound she likes music she dances she has some toys like that will play music and she'll play with those
she loves music and dance
she'll stop what she's doing if you know a commercial comes on with a little jingle to go over to it and dance
okay
you can't eat that either baby
well you know it looks like food
it's fine to get the mushrooms the olives off of it
you're funny
you're funny
well thank you so much for coming in today
no problem
can you put your shoes on
and working with us as far as with the schedule
okay
hi having fun
yes
yes
okay so i just have a few questions for you
um so this time which of the toys did he seem the most interested in
as usual the food
the food
yes
any in particular
um he really likes spoons of couse
and he's learning to put you know what things fit in and out
so he really likes smaller things that he can put in to s to bigger things
okay
but mainly if it makes noise it makes him happy
okay
what about last time
was it pretty much the same stuff
the same yeah
first and second visit
okay
um
you showing her the spoons
you giving her spoons
very nice of you to share
thank you
can you give them up
no yeah
you're not ready to give them up yet
almost
oh
um which of the toys does he seem the least interested in
um the doll
as usual
even at home he doesn't play with any of the dolls
okay
do you
d you think he recognizes the words of any of these
not yet
ah we've tried but he's never consistently done anything accident
yes
ah what about the animals
you don't think he's familiar
no
no yeah
his dad has some animals
he has the the little otter
okay
daddy has this doesn't he
the otter
what about the other ones
ah i mean we have other variations of animals but
nothing
let's see
we have some zoo stuff
so we have the fox
we have dogs
and of course we have bears
and zebra
and the frog
we have a frog don't we
uhoh
we have a big frog don't we
um what about books
is he interested at all
we love books
but we usually read those before nap and bedtime
and so he is just in the last couple of weeks gotten s ah more attached to the touch and books
and then of course the ones if there's a hole in the front of the book
he loves 
so the hungry our favorite right now they have holes in it
okay
d you d you own any of these books
we have see we have the foot book
and we have the bigger version of put me
and we have the bigger one of good night
okay
d you ever play with pretend food at home
yes
okay d you have any of these items
um some of the stuff exactly the same like the ice
and plates
but ah other things just similar
we have bread pizza
don't we
and of course you have dolly cups and bottles
but we don't have anything like this do we
no we do not
let's see what else do we have
i think that's pretty much all we have for you today
yes
okay
do you mind if i ask you a few questions
sure
okay
um did you see any or did you notice anything different from last time
um not so much
i mean i think he he kind of
well he i think he maybe self himself a little more
in terms of he kind of moved through the toys more on his own i guess
um and you know i tried to let him do that to see what he was interested in
sorry
uh but not not a heck of a lot of difference
okay
um the toys that he chose to play with this time
well he i think he likes more of those toys
he's he's he's sort of somewhat interested in everything
he was less interested i think in the books this time
last time i think i tried to read him a book and this time i didn't
he didn't seem very into it
i mean i sort of did
but he didn't seem into it at all
um he seemed actually kind of interested in this thing for for more than before
i'm not really sure why
um and you know he seemed somewhat interested in the animals
but i think those toys are a little more interesting to him in in general
do you think he recognized the clock from home
no
i don't think i think he wants to teeth on it actually
i think it's the texture
at first i thought he was trying to play peekaboo
he's been doing that a lot lately
like on the changing table he might pull up his onesie over his head and do peekaboo
um but he likes things obviously like that that are that make a little bit of noise
and he is teething so
um i mean he's been he was last time too
he has a lot of teeth
and so i think he's looking also for a certain texture sometimes
okay
do you think he recognized the word clock
no
no
how about any of the other toys this time
do you think he recognized any of their names
uh you know i don't think so really
because um yeah like we don't have like a fox at home
um uh i don't know
honestly these are really difficult
book maybe
but um doggie maybe
but i'm not sure
like my my other son has a ton of stuffed animals
but none of them look like that
so i don't know if he recog
d you know what i mean
like if he really recognizes the words
i'm not sure
i feel like he doesn't recognize a lot of words yet
but i think he understands like intonation and and meaning more so
like you know when when you're like don't touch that kind of thing versus like you know trying to be more like happy about something
i think he understands that much more than than the words themselves
okay
that makes sense
um any foods um that he might
well the peas that he eats are a little more pureed than that
so i don't know
i mean and we've started to obviously he has um you know good swallowing and chewing
i've been trying to do some like mashed peas for him without the skin
um he might recognize them
but i'm not really sure
the waffle he has some wheat free ones that he has occasionally
so he might recognize that
but they're round not square
so i don't know
okay
and how about at home
any changes in the toys that he's playing he's been playing with at home
you know not really
the funny thing is actually like i feel like here maybe it's because there's it's quieter and less distractions but like he sat and played with all the toys
and at home i feel like if you try to get him interested in something he'll wanna go and like play with the dog's toys or go and like you know uh pull up the plants or something like that
like he's much more into doing something else other than like kind of sitting here and playing with the different toys in a way even when you try to do that with him
it's kind of funny
yeah
i don't know
okay
um how about any activities that you played
i know you had um
that we do at home versus here
well yeah or maybe that you did do here
either one
it doesn't have to be different than what you did here
well we do similar things at at home
like we might play with certain types of toys or um try and read a book or play with like stuffed animals or things like that
so i mean it's somewhat the same
i mean a a lot of times like i say i think he's more active at home
like he likes to be walking around holding onto your hands and that type of um uh activity
okay
i think that's um
oh maybe what what do you think he was most interested in
um i think those spoons at the end there actually
that he was interested in that pitcher for a little bit and the spoons
i think he liked trying to stick them stick them in his mouth
and i think he liked the sound that they made and the fact that there was more than one of 
um but yeah i think
and a little bit with the the bee like when it bounced
he smiled when i did that a little bit
um so
but i think for himself i think the the spoons
do you find you're using um like a lot of sound effects at home when you like use animals and things that's what he he likes sound effects
um i'm not sure if i u uh
i don't know if i u
i mean i guess i do to some extent
um
you know
it's kinda fun watching him like trying to figure these things out and that kind of stuff
um yeah i mean i think he i think he likes i think he likes being surprised sometimes
like he loves playing peekaboo
sometimes like you can really get him laughing
and um he has this clacker toy that it's it's a musical thing that he thinks it's hysterical
i don't know why
you know like
but that's like one of the few things he responds to like that
so i guess he does like
he likes getting like you know raspberries on his on his skin and stuff like that
he likes um you know uh being sort of like held up and down kind of thing
so i mean he um uh i think he he sort of likes a diversity of activities i guess
hey
and at one point i could tell he was trying to make a poop
that's okay
uh so you think this time he he probably preferred the books least
yeah
i'd say least this time
yeah definitely
seems to be liking that pile over there
yeah today he really seemed into it
he also yeah he's into throwing stuff too so
and i'm not sure if he's doing it for the this part of it or to hear them like as they you know kind of crash together kind of thing
right
alright
thank you very much for coming in
we always appreciate it
yeah
okay no problem
model baby behavior
yeah normally it's like i'm trying to get him to you know stay out of trouble
he was great
okay
let's stop there
okay
she kept looking up at you guys like why won't you play with me and smile
oh really
mean sitting in the corner
okay
let's see
um
so which group of toys did she seem interested in
um i think definitely the play food was her favorite
play food
yeah
did she like any specific ones
um she liked the pizza
uh liked the pizza a lot
the pasta
um the peas
the plate
you gonna say hi
um she liked the uh the pitcher and the spoon
she played with that a lot
and the uh carrot soup she liked
okay
would you would she recognize any of these do you think
um yeah she recognized i think the peas we we've had peas the past couple nights
um pizza she i don't know if she would necessarily recognize the shape per say we cut it up but you know i've said you know this is she's had pizza before i've cut up
um and bread
you know she knows her bread and we just had pasta for the first time too this week so i think she
yeah
okay um
so why would you say she likes this group
um i mean she did play with the frog too she liked the frog
and the eagle she played with
um i think it's because we really don't have any play food at home so it's something new different
okay
yeah
um
interesting
yeah
we uh we asked for some for your birthday right
so
um but i think that that was the main reason
um she loves she has plenty of books at home and loves her books at home
you know she'll take all off her shelf and flip through and
um and she has some stuffed animals but they're really you know she could take or leave 
yeah
um do you have any of the books we have
um we have goodnight moon but not in the board book
we have the foot book and mister brown
um and we have a karen katz book but not the baby peekaboo
okay
uh let's see
so which would you say she was least interested in
the books or
uh yeah i guess the books
i tried to read her peekaboo and she was like
okay
um do you think there're any other items she'd recognize the name of
um definitely cheese
um she loves cheese so she would recognize the cheese the pizza the peas the bread
um
oh ice
you haven't had ice
one day you'll know what that is
got the keys
we have keys at home
hi
aw
um oh what about the animals would she recognize names of or
um she recognized some of um
um you know we talked about frogs and she has some books about frogs or that have frogs in 
um you know the bumblebee she would recognize the name
okay
um and you said you have
oh you answered that question
would you say she prefers toys or books now
um
at home
at home i mean it's it's pretty much a fifty fifty split
like in um when we play in the living room we have all of her toys and she has some books there but when we're in her room she has a lot more books and she'll play you know she'll take all the books of her shelf and
so it's pretty split
you know it depends on where we are and what she's in the mood for but um
okay
oh you got it
you know how to eat it
you know how to eat it
um oh what about the doll
did she
didn't even go near it
no
does she have any dolls at home
um not like that no
she has like a um a more of a stuffed doll um
oh yeah
that you know but not but she doesn't have like a real babydoll
okay
um i think that's it
unless is there anything you want to tell us like does she have a favorite toy at home or anything
um
ball maybe
she does like um she has a couple of balls she does like to to chase those around and watch roll
um she likes um right now we have um like she loves her cups you know like the stacking cups and um the rings
you know she's she's putting on the rings and things
um
yeah
she really liked the pitcher
and the spoon
oh yeah
yeah
that's a big
yeah
okay i think we're all set then
great
you did a good job
say thank you
we can turn everything off
oh did she get her prize already
yes
yes we did
she got a book
you want your peas
peas
wanna
you can play while we talk
with the toys
and not the big girl toys
the little girl toys
she was here just very recently and i don't remember um i was in the play session or not but anyway maybe you can just tell me any observations you have about uh if she's playing with different toys or if she's playing differently than last time
basically the same she loves this plastic play food
and like she at home her favorite thing is books but i really she doesn't care about the books here
because she has this cool stuff
because like i said before she's obsessed with food like she's really into eating
she begs like a dog at the table for just scraps of food so i guess anything that
so do you think she thinks that those look like food
looks like it's edible
um
like would she recognize any of those items as food that she's had at home or she's seen you guys eat
i'm not sure
maybe the peas
but i dunno if it's just the texture might feel good on her on her gums
but i know that she recognizes this for a bottle and she recognizes this for a sippy cup she's like
so
and she knows that these are cookies i'm pretty sure
any of the other foods that you think shh um she's been exposed to
um i don't think so
and how um the utensils and things like that does she have anything like that at home or play with real
um she has measuring spoons that she doesn't really i mean she kinda clacks around with them for thirty seconds and then
but i guess the thing she's into now is putting stuff into things
so last time she didn't put things in things like she did this time
and remove them
like she'll just sit there at home and put things in boxes and take them out over and over again
and she did that here
so
so that's
yeah
that's neat
i would say
yeah
very cool
um she didn't look at the stuffed animals is that right
no she doesn't care about stuffed animals
okay
does she have any stuffed animals at home
she has a lot
does she like 
no
she just doesn't care
how about baby dolls does she have any baby doll at home
she has a baby doll at home and she likes to lick and kiss on it's face
but i couldn't get her to do that maybe this one is kinda scary lookin
oh no
there we go
there we go much better
but i dunno if she
do you like babies
okay
but she's more into like i guess working on her moving her motor skills than playing now
like she doesn't care about toys if she can move around
in general
so
that sorta makes sense for this age too
that's more common
yeah like
so you said at home she does have a lot of books and she likes she likes them
yep
does she like to turn the pages herself
um and does she have favorite ones
um
like that she would go and get for you to read to her or
i think pat the
what did you find
what is it
what is it
yeah well that's her favorite thing is to find
i don't know where you found that
find scraps
i don't see any more
thank you
any more
whatcha doin
finding all the stuff that shouldn't be there
yep
i don't need a vacuum cleaner any more
how do you do that
how did you do that
tell me
what do you like to play with
oh i love a baby this age
it's fun
it is fun
you're fun
you keep mom busy i bet
yeah
so she's interested in um doin movin around type of stuff and she probably has toy different toys at home that she likes too that um she doesn't that we don't have here
um yeah
like pushing toys or
yeah she has like a little push wooden push wagon thing that she likes to use up and down the hallway
and basically anything that's not designed to be a toy she prefers
like toilet paper tubes and candy wrappers
just that kind of stuff
my laptop she likes to type on the keys
so i got her like a i got her she has a keyboard that she just kind of like bangs on
so do you think that she's imitating you
yep
um are there any other differences between what she was sort of doing here and what she does at home in terms of play
probably the biggest thing
um
she doesn't stay very focused on her toys at home
like she would have already been up in the time that we were i was sitting here playing with her she would have been up twice and left where she was
and found another thing of toys in another room
okay so she's more active in general is what you're saying
yeah
um i think that's it
all i have to ask you if um there's anything you think i missed
um no i don't think
i think that's pretty good
you did a good job
you are capable of moving around
yeah well we mostly stuck to the food
what did he seem to like the best
any particular items
so let's see
we played a lot with the cookies and then he really liked the canned soup kind of using like a drum
so we did that for a long time
and we only went to the book at the very end when he started crawling away
he didn't do the puppets at all
okay
which i think has been true for all of all of his visits
did he play differently than
i don't remember
i think last time he did play with these things that you can tap together but i think he played with like peas and maybe pasta
i think we got the parfait out at one point
and i know that
yeah
we start he started he went to the cookies first like as soon as we came in here
he had the cookies for a while
do you think
yeah he was putting them in his mouth spontaneously
i don't think i modeled that for him
i'm i think i modeled putting the pizza in my mouth but then he was putting the cookies in his mouth over and over again i'm pre i know i'm he knows the word cookie so
uh
yeah well so he put the cups to his mouth and the bottle that was pretty
although he started out with the bottle on the wrong side
we don't ever u drink a from a bottle so um he figured out how to do it later
and then he put the soup in his mouth even though that's not really appropriate
i think he put the pizza in his mouth maybe
he didn't put the ice he picked the ice up at one point i don't think he stuck that in his mouth i think he put the waffles in his mouth
but i might have modeled that
ahhah
yeah
but he um yeah he didn't put the bread in his mouth
he used the bread as like more like a drum
but he doesn't
he eats bread and he loves pancakes
he ate
that's right yes
are you thirsty
so i think waffles are the closest thing as that and i said something about they're like pancakes
um a he eats like cru like pizza crusts so he should recognize that um
and cookies
and peas
we eat peas
um and his brother eats ice so he might know that word
okay
just from like it sort of being talked about
right
so and that happens when there's another sibling
words that his brother
he definitely knows the word cookie
um i'm pretty sure he knows the word bread and peas
he probably knows the word pizza
we eat it a lot
um maybe he doesn't know the word bread
it might be toast
um yeah
is it toast
right at the end yeah
he played with the baby a little bit
i brought it over
so he didn't spontaneously go to the baby
but he was like he made some vocalizations like talking to the baby and then kissing the baby a lot and then gave the baby sort of the bottle in the general direction of the baby
really interesting
yeah
does he have a baby doll at home to play with
you know um we just have two boys so um liam got one for christmas and then liam has started a little bit with like at the um playgroup to like play with the babies and dolls and like push them around in the strollers and stuff
so we got one at christmas so there's one in the house that is more liam's than his
um he could like play with it but he hasn't really like we just got it at christmas
yeah
you are a nice guy
yeah
does he like books at home
yes we read a lot of books
does he like to turn the pages himself or does he like you to do it
he likes to turn the pages himself
is this uh at home or is it different
uh it's probably about the same
he like plays with one thing for a while and then he moves on to something else
hey buddy
i think that might be all that i need to ask you
if there's any thing else i didn't ask you that you think would be good for us to know about how he plays with the different toys or what his interests are at this point
his interests which i think is the same as before are pretty much whatever his brother's into
so we play a lot more with like cars and trucks and planes and trains and transportation stuff and balls and um puzzles
although he doesn't really like do puzzles but he sort of like plays with the puzzle pieces and stuff so that's more what we play with at home
we have a bunch of stuffed animals but we don't really play with them
and um we have a bunch of books not these books but other books um
but he likes to read
yeah you all ready to go
all done
which toys do you think asher was interested in
definitely interested in the food
yeah he's been that way uh
all three times
and he also likes the baby
and the bottle anything plastic that he can chew on
so would you say that um his interests really haven't changed since the last time of which toys that he's gone to
was there anything that was new or that he didn't go to
um
he
his interests have pretty much stayed the same
he's more interested in the baby and feeding the baby than he was last time
so
that was new
but for the most part yeah he paid some attention to the books and a lot of attention to the food and
would this are these the type of things that he has at home
um he does not not have any plastic food at home
he does have some stuffed animals he does not have a babydoll
lots of foods so
some of each i guess
yeah
i mean he has he doesn't have food but he has lots of plastic things that he likes to stick in his mouth so
um
similar
now the books was it mostly just you picking up a book or do any of them he wanted to go to
it was mostly just me uh
which is interesting at home he loves books and here he's not as interested he doesn't really
he didn't really go to any of them
but like the touch and one he played with for a little bit and felt the appropriate
do you have books like that at home
little circle
yes
he does
yup
um
he really does look at
so
ah hi
you mentioned he has a lot of books at home is that mostly what he plays with or you also like what would be his most the thing that he plays with the most at home
what he plays with at home is everything he's not supposed to he's more interested in mommy and daddy's stuff than he is in his own stuff but
uh with his toys he has like uh
he has some plastic nesting cups you know that kind of fit inside each other and stack up and he really likes those
yeah
uhoh you don't wanna step on the
oh
sorry
boo
um
oh and he uh
but he likes his books a lot at home he plays with uh
he has a few uh like a stacker toy
but he likes that although mainly the pulling it apart but
um so you mentioned he liked the food a lot but he doesn't have those types of things at home but do you think that he recognized any of them as the food like does he eat any of those
um
yeah we have we do waffles and peas and he eats those i think he might recognize those
uh the pizza i think he mainly likes the fun shape to it
but uh
he's never really eaten pizza before he's seen it
but he hasn't eaten a whole lot of it so
um
yeah i think he does actually recognize it as food
i don't think he did the first couple of times
but now i think he does make more of an association
oh is that locked
so he can't get that open
i think so
okay
um now you when you were playing with him you said a lot of the names out loud do you think he recognizes theses these names like the things you were saying do you think he
i think he does
i think most of them
knows starting to recognize the world
most of them
so which toys do you think she was the most interested in
um the pizza
not sure why
yeah
you found it
didn't you
was it the same as last time
um i don't think so i think she liked the keys more last time
which she still liked this time
that's why you have this
there
um and
why do you think she was most interested in the pizza
um
i don't know
i set it up when we first got in here
i don't know if she saw that or
just likes the texture of it
yeah
okay what do you think she was least interested in here
uh
stuffed animals
um did you look at any books while you were here
uh just one
she was more interested in playing with the toys though
is that typical for her
no
she usually likes to at least look at the books
but there's so much more stuff to look at
that she's not used to at home
do you have similar toys at home
um
we have food
and books
and stuffed animals
nothing exactly the same
what about the doll
does she have things like that
oh yeah
she loves dolls
i'm sure her older sister has some too
just a few
um do you think she would recognize the name of any of the objects we have here
um
books and bottles and maybe some of the food
and obviously the doll
okay and uh
does she eat any of the foods that we have here
yeah she'll eat pizza and bread and cheese and waffles
cheese doesn't look exactly like ours
alright is there anything else you think we should know about her play
are there things that are different that she does at home that we didn't see here
i don't think so
i mean other than putting everything in her mouth
normally she doesn't have her pacifier in her mouth
so everything goes in
that seems to be pretty typical for kids of this age
yep
yep
hi
um
so what did you notice was different from last time
um
well different
which toys did
we okay we didn't we didn't do the peekaboo book before
and we didn't really use the pitcher for banging
he always comes back to these cylinder kind of things
um
but that was the first time he banged it on the the pitcher to get the noises
he was always banging them together before
um never picked up the cookie before or the ice
a otherwise i think he went to the same things pretty much
more or less
and the cylinders yeah that's it
so what items do you like the best
um he definitely liked you know hitting th these things on the pitcher
that was a definite good one and he liked the peekaboo book for a little while
do you have that book at home
do you have anything like it
actually we don't and we
played peekaboo a little differently at home
we like cover him up with a little towel and he pulls off himself and does peekaboo but
no we actually we don't have anything like that
do you play any other games like peekaboo with him and stuff
we tr we try and play peekaboo we try and play um you know so big and
and pattycake but so far he really hasn't i mean he thinks they're funny
but he won't actually play along
what do ya doing bud
um but he yeah he laughs during 
which items do you think he liked the least
the least
he never seems interested in the in the plush animals
when i try and do that
hi
wait what did you do to your head
oh my goodness
um he wasn't really interested in anything unless it made noise
although he liked the
he didn't seem very interested in this one when i tried to give it to 
yeah
oh
does he uh play with toys that make a lot of noise at home
he does he does
he either makes the noise with blocks
we have blocks and those little shapes that go into things
so he makes the noise that way or we have toys that you know are electronic and have sing songs
song songs or the alphabet
so um do you have food items at home
we do not
i'm thinking we might need to he he he won't eat food
he won't pick up food and put anything in his mouth so the
fact that he put that cookie in his mouth was actually kind of big 
he doesn't he doesn't let us put anything in his mouth
besides baby food
like any pops or cheerios or anything like that he won't have anything to do with it
until he figures out how delicious they are
i know
that's why i'm like not like i don't wanna give him something sweet or that's all i'm ever gonna get out of him
right bud
but yeah we don't have any food items at home
do you have any of the same books
um we have good night moon
uh we have something similar to this one
i don't know if it's this one it's a little bit different but it's similar to this one
and that's it
so you said a lot of the names of the objects would he recognize any of those names at home
no we haven't we haven't been able to figure out if he's if he knows any terms yet
but um yeah i mean we tend to name when we're playing with 
but especially since we don't have any of these things at home i'm sure he doesn't know any of the names
are you gonna stand up on your own
really
do that on video that would be cool
so um the toys that he chose do you think they match his personality
like making the noise and uh cylinder
yeah yeah he likes things that he can really grab and things that he can bang together to make nosie
or things that he can you know like this that he he likes to turn around and see what they are
so yeah and he he he kinda pushed away the ones that were kind of just plain and weren't gonna make a whole lot of noise
or wouldn't fit in his hand as well either i guess that would be the other thing he likes to he likes to be able to hold it and turn it around
yeah
yeah
you're trying to feed him and he's like rejecting are there any
you know
um pasta we've tried pasta
um bread
cheese little bits of meat
um cheerio type things
um some vegetables
little bit o everything
so far nothing
occasionally we can we can sneak some in but um we've been told it's kind of a texture thing he doesn't like the texture of it
what you doing
go get that
no baby dolls are at home or
other
we have a lot o animals
a lot of um not necessarily s we have a few stuffed animals the only one's he's really been interested in has actually been a rather large panda bear
um and we do have a a little a little bear that he's a little bit interested in
um
but in general he's right now his biggest thing at home is he
and he didn't do it here which
surprises me he takes whatever he can like a box or or you know we have this little remote thing that that says numbers
and he pushes it around like a truck
which he did not do here but that that actually is kind of a normal thing he'll take whatever he can and and try and push it around
he's getting more by himself
yeah
into throwing
and then we
we have a cat who is extremely tolerant that has also kind of become his toy
aw
what are you doing
oh so none of
the animal names here today even though he didn't well i guess he didn't play with them
but
do you think he would be familiar with any of it
i don't
i don't think he'd be familiar with any of 
we do like with the books we do noi uh animal sounds
but i don't i don't see any recognition that he knows
what animal it is
but like hey rydan what does the cow say
the cow says moo moo
moo moo
yeah
usually he laughs when we do the noises but i yeah i mean my husband and i were talking about it and we don't think he might recognize um something physical we do like
when we ask him to come here we might be in another room and tell him to come here and maybe the tone of our voice or or something like that he recognizes but we don't think he actually recognizes the terms yet
anyway what are you doing
do you um say any like words of encouragement like good job or
uhhum usually usually
especially when especially when he does something new we tend i guess to do it more when he does it the first time than
after that but uh most of his play is pretty physical
so he tends to want to stand and and roam around
he get gets the you know the uh bowls out and the lids from the kitchen and bang on those
what are you doing
what are you doing
there it goes
where you goin
is it okay if i ask you a few questions
sure
um
we're making peas with our friends
sure
so have there been any changes since the last visit in what he liked or didn't like or anything
um last time he i remember he really liked the peas
and the ice cone
um and i think he was even like two fisting with the ice cones
and this time he did not wanna let go of the spoon it seemed like
um and he used it like as a tool against the other toys and stuff
um ah which of the toys seemed to interest him the most besides those would you say
um the spoon definitely interested him
the most
um other things
i guess the fake food in general
the pizza the peas
the meat
the pitcher
um he was a bit more interested in the books this time
but not a great deal
yeah haha
yeah
he seemed to like that one
um how about any of the stuffed animals or anything was he into or
um he wasn't really into them unless i made him be or interacted with it
yeah he remembered the bee
or remembered it or interacted with it a little bit
but
um which of the toys d you think he was least interested in this time
um probably the baby doll
except for its location was kind of in his way a little bit
um but that along with the s the rest of the stuffed animals so
d you think there's like
this is kind of like an interesting question but
d you think there's like a toy that like fits his personality best at this stage
um usually it's things that make noise
so i think he was excited to see the spoon and the pitcher could make a good noise
um he loves putting things in his mouth
so the food definitely goes along with that
thank you
and he likes he's pretty social
so things he can be social with too
are a lot of these like foods you have in your house that he would recognize and
um i think so
we don't have them as toys
but um except for the sweets
he's probably had most of the food
um just we we like table food
no purees for you right guy
so um yeah so he's probably had most of it
i mean not the ice
but like even an ice cone
so
what book did or what was the book again that your child preferred to look at
yeah the karen katz peekaboo book
here it is
yeah
he got all excited
peekababy yeah
um d you normally like read with him at home
definitely
a lot of reading
we have a karen katz book too
um i definitely encourage him to turn pages and that kinda thing
d you think he prefers like books or toys or
um it used to be books
i think he's getting more into toys now
but um he still likes the books
that's good
you're pretty literate right kid
um d you think he's starting to recognize the names of any of these more
like showing signs of
um i do
sometimes um at home if he seems upset or whatever
and i get him into my lap to calm him i'll say
oh let's read a book
and he'll get excited and that kinda thing
um d you have any other
and ah some of his stuffed animals at home have names
and he recognizes those
like tigger
um what about the food frances
did you recognize the names of food
i think so
i don't i don't know that there's any evidence of that
but it's just kind of a feeling
i don't know what we filled out on our chart
is there anything at home like stuff at home too that he recognizes
you mentioned tigger
like anything other than that too or
um tigger
some other blocks that he has to build with
um you like blocks right
and then trying to think what else
yeah some other stuffed animals
the fish or
or different books
things he likes the most
yeah
definitely
yeah
i guess that's pretty much it
okay
great
well
did you pass
did you pass you did a good job
did a good job
thanks
it's funny 
the bee
yeah yeah he loves that hair
it's funny coming back here of course the toys are generally set up the same
but he does interact so differently over the a month or two later
um it's different than seeing it at home
you know day by day you forget but
pretty neat
d you notice like home too you said he's being more into noise and stuff like that
is there anything else that you see his interests are shifting from one thing to another
sure
um well definitely he's more into moving things now
so he might bring a t you know go get a toy and then bring it to another area
um yeah you like to stand up too
so sometimes he'll play with toys up
and puzzles
we have a shape sorter
and it's funny to see him progress with that
it's fun and funny
first we would just took the lid off
and dumped shapes out
and then he started putting shapes into the bucket
and now he's putting shapes into the shape sorter
um so we'll see if it's going in if it goes into the shape sorter lid and then into the bucket
he's not quite there yet
but haha that's alright
you're having fun
so and it's funny the shape sorter
he'll realize okay the circle shape goes into the circle hole
and if i take the lid and turn it around he'll still put it in that top left corner so
he's figuring it out
that's good
you seem to do a really good job of like explaining things to him and everything
thanks
yeah maybe i overcompensate here
you know i like to give him some independent play too at home
but it's fun
part of the reason to have a baby
is to interact with the toys so
rattle
uh huh
i was wondering how that would take you to find the
good thing it was towards the end
yeah
um what do ya think
oh
she seemed to like the most
um
she liked shaking the keys
and
i think she liked the pasta too
or the food i guess
yeah
is that different from last time
yes
cause last time i feel like she spent i mean she spent time with the baby this time but this time or
this time i felt like she spent more time with the food and and the keys than the the baby
yeah
what do you think uh how did she play with the baby this time
um she still sort of exploring exploring it
i i feel like
um
looking at the eyes but just sort of
and she kissed it but
oh yup and there she goes
um
yeah
is she looking at particular like body parts or do you talk about particular body parts
we do
and um it's funny because we have friends that have babies
and when we get together with them she's very into looking at their different parts you know just checking all out and everything like that
so
does she know is our our like eyes nose mouth familiar to her
familiar terms
um
i think so
we do a little little thing where its um she knows like fingers and nose and toes i think because we do like kissy finger kissy nose
oh okay
so
right
how about the food at this uh point
are there new foods that are more familiar to her
um
well she definitely i mean she eats waffles
and she eats bread
and she eats carrots
um
and then
my mom at her house and we go over to her house quite often has clay pizza and clay spaghetti
she eats some spaghetti sometimes
mash it up
right do we mash up spaghetti
yeah
so it doesn't exactly look like that but yeah you know it
right
a little bit
i guess
she eats it plain
um
yes for the most part
sometimes we'll add in like we'll mash it up cause she doesn't necessarily have she only has two teeth so
um
we'll mash it up and then we put in some vegetable or something with it so
you'll eat it
so not necessarily tomato but something else so carrot sauce or something on top
right
yeah
you like your farm animals
do you think uh d you have play food at home
we do have some play food at home
most of the play food that we have at home is um we have well we have pots and pans
so they pretend like her older brother will pretend to make something and say here you go ella this is whatever
um
but then a lot of it is just plain um like cans plastic cans and stuff like that so we haven't gotten we don't have this detailed stuff
so
thank you
and so she usually plays with her brother with those things
yup yes
do you guys cook in the kitchen
do you like to cook in the kitchen
yeah
oh you want me put you down
okay
you can play with the baby doll you can play with all these toys just not the wire
okay
look
it was very
what was the toy that was least interesting to her
what did you think was least interesting huh
what did you find least interesting
no
did she play
maybe the book
what oh what i'm sorry
oh no i was gon say the book
but no go ahead
but i dunno well but she i mean she was interested i felt like she was into it
she's trying to do some of the like mimic some of the sounds
cause her brother they have um a fisherprice the farm
and so he'll take some of the animals and he'll be like a cow says moo ella
and she'll be like and she'll i mean sometimes she'll say it sometimes she won't but
so she's like familiar with the animals sounds
yes
uh which animal sounds are
she'll do moo
but he does i mean like he also i mean he is a boy so he'll be like moo so it's
she like imitates the moo
but um she does moo and baa
and sometimes i think she tries to do cluck
can't quite get it yet what that's a cluck
that's a cluck yeah
yeah
that's funny
neigh
sometimes we try neigh
cause we also have a horse we both ride
do you have um is this the only book that you read here today
yes
do you have books like that at home
we do have yes
where you can like touch and feel
and we actually have put me in well we have put me in the zoo
um
but the full size one so she doesn't really get into it
i mean she gets into it but
because they have the regular pages we try to just do the board books cause she's not quite um gentle enough with the ones that have the regular pages so
right
so we just do that at nap time
yeah
you're funny
uh what about the stuffed animals
um
she was into the winnie the and punxsutawney phil
i felt like but then the rest of them she didn't really get into i guess this time
are there any um animal names or that she's
um
maybe she's
i'm trying to think
she knows she might know what a frog like a frog she would might know
she knows um again farm animals
i guess she would've known the chicken except for most the chickens we have a brown chickens are just around the house just for i dunno for whatever reason we have
i mean we don't have real chicken but you know like the different pieces you know or different little play things are brown chickens
so
i dunno if she would
um
and then again farm animals
we have a lot of farm animals
and we have like giraffes giraffes and elephants and stuff
huh we don't have a zebra at home
so
yeah i guess a lot of them she wouldn't necessarily she might know a dog
but she doesn't really like real dogs so
oh okay
yeah so i don't know if that i don't
she knows what that looks like at least
yes
yeah
d you think um have there ever have there been any changes since the last visit in terms of how she plays with toys
um
oh sorry
can you hand that back to mommy please
yes
yes
gotcha
there
um
she'll sit and play with toys she she mimics a lot more i feel like
she'll watch her brother do stuff and then she'll sort of do that
and the other thing is that at home i mean we have a doll and stuff but most of the things we have are like cars and trucks and stuff just because
that's what our brother liked
and so we have so she she'll play with those and she'll like vroom the car and stuff like that
oh okay
so
so more like
is she is she still banging and playing that way
yes she yes she'll she'll bang things together
we have a play piano
but you know just like a little kids one it has like the four things
and she'll bang on that and play the music
the foot book
we have that character at home
and is she using utensils to eat
um she tries to grab the spoon
um
when we're feeding her but she can't quite get it to her her mouth yet
so
um it's very messy so
so we try
experimental
yeah experimental right
very experimental
right
but then you'll
she does we'll do um
things like i'll cut up bananas and stuff and she'll take it with her hand
but she can't quite get it in the spoon yet
what are you doing
she fell so gentle at first
she's a little dramatic too
and them um she was playing with the keys
yes she loves keys
real keys
she'll real keys
she'll shake my keys
and she'll play with those
she likes to do that
you're just
yeah
you see the chicken
cluck
that what a chicken says
think you're gettin teeth
that would be nice
and does she usually play with um toys like this
this kinda like this all round and
um
yes
we have like something like that where you have the the different buckets
so each of the buckets have sort of a different thing in it
and my ideal is to have william her brother take one out and then play with that and then put it back
but that doesn't necessarily always happen
you know we we try but
um
so a lot of times there are different toys spread out that she will go and and figure out
and play with
where you going
she has a hammer she likes to hammer too
oh this way ella bee
oh does she
d you like to hammer
yeah
measuring spoon
you help us measure
yes
no's her favorite
well unfortunately i think recently we've heard that a lot
right
cause we like to go up stairs
we like to find cords
we like to find and play with things we're not supposed to play with
oh
those are the things that interest us
oh
and oh
oh yes oh her brother will say that a lot too and be like oh
that's funny no and oh
oh
no oh
is there anything else that um you noticed that was different about this session that she played with or didn't play with
i was very surprised she didn't play with the baby's shoes
because at home she will work very hard to find everyone's shoes
and play with the shoes
and i mean she tries to chew on them too but like just play with them and everything
yesterday she just got a pair of shoes from when we're outside and um she was obsessed with those too
i was very i was surprised that she didn't on the baby doll
now she doesn't have a baby doll that has shoes
all of her baby dolls are pretty much soft baby dolls
so they have like the shoes already on you know on them or whatever they don't come off so i don't know but i was i was kinda surprised
cause she does like shoes
oh cause she might've she didn't know if she even knew that they came off type of thing
right yeah
or i mean i was just
oh are you chewin on the the dog
woof
woof
woof
yeah that's a dog
lets not chew on his nose
nah yeah
he might not like to have his nose chewed on
can he give you kisses though
lets give the dog kisses
she's like wait that's a dog
i know get him away from me no
ah yeah that's peanut butter
um i'm trying to think
what else
was different
hey
this way
come this way
i love you
oops sorry
it's okay
alrighty
where you going
you're supposed to be over here with the toys
with the toys
toys over here
i'll get this
you can pull yourself up on anything huh
you don't know yes
are you all done
all done
all done
good job yay
yay look at you
you're like yay i'm all done
i see all these other things i can get to
glad you just noticed them right now
yeah
great timing
yes
okay well we'll just end it with it on that note
okay
um
sorry
basically this is the last ah
okay
i guess i'll do the questions now
yeah i think he's just making a break for it
yeah
okay
okay so we just have a few questions
okay
um i don't i wasn't with you the fir the previous two times bes so i don't know which toys was he most interested in
uh still the food
likes the food toys
were there any food items in particular
not s much
i mean he he usually he consistently seems to go for the peas
i don't know if it's the color of the texture
uh but that's consistent
uh the spoons he spent the most time with
i think that he se he likes the rattling noise
so both last time
uh last time
no this is the first time he's really been and he's you know seems specifically drawn to them
uh he's always kind of gone to this one he's got one of these at home
or one like this at home
um he'll reach for the books but then he loses interest in the books
okay
um and that's pretty consistent
this is probably the most he's tried to eat all the toys
all of the toys but uh it's
yeah y we're talking about you
the the bear the spoons and the food seem to be
okay
and what about the items that he seemed the least interested in
um he didn't seem to much go for too many of the stuffed guys
well the other stuff guys
i mean i i don't know if he remembered him or or what the deal the the yellow and black striped
uhhum
um
completely no interest in like the bottles
or the
clock
or
or any of those
but uh
was that the same last time
yeah he was in the he'd yeah he would you know he'd
i think he associates reading with bedtime
okay
i read to him at night and then i put him down
and then if he's if we try to read during the day he's like oh no
no no no no
i know what you're doing
so he doesn't seem to be a fan
he's a little bit more subtle to ua he's a little bit more receptive about it at night
okay
so
what about the stuffed animals since the last time
um stuffed animals n the nothing specifically
keep hitting your head
nothing but the pooh the pooh bear
do you think he recognizes names for any of these items
um i usually call them your friend
you know do you wanna bring your friend with you your friend
and so if he if he's holding so i don't know if he knows that pooh is pooh and
you know i don't think he can differentiate between th i just call them this is your friend you know
right
so i i give it sort of a generic name
what about the food items
do you think he's starting to recognize some of the food
um
it's possible
his peas don't look this
so i find it interesting that he's very fascinated by them
um so and and i don't i've never given him waffles i've given him bread
an but it his bread doesn't even look like this
so i mean you know by the time he gets it it's the chopped up into little pieces so
i i i don't think so i i'm thinking it's either the color or the texture he's attracted to
so and of course the he's never in he's never in life had one of these
he was kind of into the shake
okay
and do you have any of these toys or similar ones at home
no just the pooh
okay
um what about the books
you said that you read to him at night
do you have any of these
we only have good night moon
okay
uh that's the only one that
that we have
okay
and good night moon he he usually i think it's just it's long
he usually gets he's like alright are we asleep yet
um do you play with pretend food at home
uh no
you have to so if you had if you were asked if he prefers books over toys or toys over books
i'd say toys over books
okay i think
and the animals you're saying he doesn't
some kids are really fascinated by animals very early on
uh we have two dogs at home so i think you know
the stuffed ones are
you know he's like ah i got a live one
that's okay
sounds good well i think that's all we have for now
yeah
you did really good
now well you get to pick a toy to take home i forget
wanna pick your own toy
pick your own toy
i wanna heart
probably take that microphone off
oop
sorry
you okay
yeah i am so it's caught in my hair
hi
hi
you're getting ready to walk huh
working on it
yeah won't be long
yeah that looks kinda realistic
it does
have you ever had one
alright
you can play
you can play
so how do you think she um today compares with the last time that she was here in terms of what she wanted to do
i think it um is very similar to her sister also that there she had a more varied interest last time
and this time it was pretty much in the middle category of plastic products
and is she teething also
yes
yes she cut her most recent tooth little less than a week ago
like five days ago
so you were just on schedule
yeah
okay did she have any particular um items that
she went straight for the pizza pieces and really kind of came kept coming back to the pizza though
that's her favorite
huh
it sounds like you showed her other things
i did
she liked this bottle too
okay
i would say this one
the bottle was her second favorite
yeah and then she did spend some time with the sandwich parts um but not as much
she's probably not had a sandwich that looks like that
right
okay
but she hasn't had pizza that looks like it either
i think the peas are the most realistic looking you know of
the food items
did she pay any attention to those
um she did pick up once and chewing on a little bit
um i definitely think they they look realistic but um when she eats peas they're like little cheerios you know she can pick them up with and do in their spread out so um i'm not sure she associated that with what peas are
okay
that's right it
you did like that
ice cone too
not that she knows what an ice cone is
no
no she hasn't had ice
okay so that must be why you think maybe she wants to chew on things
i think she yeah i think she's just teething and likes to likes different textures and the way it feels in her mouth
how about the other things
did she pay any attention to the any of the animals
um a little bit at the beginning and i tried to get her interested in the puppet but she kept eating the pizza
so
you didn't like the kangaroo
i like that one cause it has the baby
i do too i think that's really cute
and i thought that would be different we don't we don't have puppets at home i should probably get some but we don't we don't have any of those so i thought she might respond to that it's different but
does she have any of these kind of any animals that are the same as what we have
uh we have a pooh a pooh bear
um
about that size too
um and we have animals that are similar but not the not the exact ones
so you don't have an eagle
we don't have an eagle no
and
or the donkey the patriotic donkey we don't have that either
a little unusual
right
um and what about the books
she didn't go for the books at all um to be fair i didn't really try very hard to get her interested in it
and then she probably didn't did she
no she didn't go over to this category of things at all
okay so it was really mostly the food items
yeah things that feel good to chew on
okay um did she play with that
i know you said it was new
does she play with those new toys at home the those new um food items
yeah she does and it's the same thing she puts right in her mouth it
they're good to chew on and interesting um i mean she pushes the shopping cart around but i don't think she knows that she's pushing a shopping cart around i think it's just a developmental skill she's at the point where she wants to practice walking
alright
but um
but yeah she enjoys playing with the food items at home
but we don't have these particular ones
we don't have little pizzas
sandwhi a sandwich that look like this or anything like that
um let's see if i have
baby
can you come here please
no
so she has that and um at home would you say that she has a favorite kind of toy
when i know that she's teething so maybe that this influences this
i really don't think she has a favorite kind of toy she lo she likes a variety of things
at home she like books
she spends a lot of time with books
um she spends a lot of time with stuffed animals and things that look like they have a personality like she'll talk to things and um she uh she's different in her from her sister in that way she she she really responds more to things that look like little creatures
um and then she does her fair share of chewing on plastic things
but so she she kind of runs a gamut
yeah that's really
at home
it's too bad
much more than you saw here today
yeah
well the teething can can can have a big influence it's too bad we don't have a dog that looks
loulou doesn't really look that much like
right i i showed her the chihuahua thing that there was a
oh there's a
that's right
i don't know where it went
somewhere
yeah maybe she's sitting on it
maybe i'm sitting on it
maybe they're by her
yeah it's like that kind of
yeah but she liked the big dog stuffed animal and she was talking to and listening
um that's more typical of her behavior at home
that's what she was doing in the wait waiting room
okay
you liked ladies
eating like a lady
you did
you did
well i think um that's all i need to ask you unless
okay
you think of anything that i should that you think would be good for us to know
um about what she likes to do how she like to play
nope this is pretty typical
i wanted to ask you though
um and this is also i have to turn this off
okay
um
you can go ahead you can leave that right there cause that way i don't have to write everything down the answers to your questions to the questions
okay
and she can just continue to or play or whatever she's doing
okay
with her spoon
um so first question is have you noticed any differences in what she's interested in playing with or the way she's playing with toys since the last time she was here
um i think the last the last two times um she showed pretty equal interest in everything and this time she was pretty much ignored pile number three here
um i kind of think that teething has trumped everything else she went straight for things that looked hard and yummy to chew on
um and she she caught a top tooth yesterday and so i just think
ah
yeah you got some spit on you
um i kinda think that that trumped everything else in in the play session today
um but she also showed interest in in the frogs so you know it's it wasn't to the exclusion of other things
okay
did she um was she interested in any of the other animals that you got out for her
um
the chicken the frog and the chicken were the two that she showed the most interest in
i you know pointed out some other things but she didn't really going for it she definitely liked this frog
cool
you too
and how what about the hard toys that you said she did like the best
um did she have certain ones that were favorites today
the cookies
the two cookies she really liked um
this purple spoon the smaller of the two spoons she liked
um she spent a little bit of time with the sandwich parts um but mostly the cookies and the spoon
and do you think she would um recognize the names of any of these especially like the food items um
i don't know because it looks different
i make i make them sandwiches with cheese and turkey but i cut them up really small so it doesn't look like that and i so i'm not i'm not sure that she did that
um she doesn't they're not drinking juices yet so um apple juice is foreign to her
okay
um
so probably not right
not at least by the way they look
right
okay
but she's heard you say you know sandwich or turkey or she
cheese yeah she's definitely heard those things bread
lets see what else
and she did she look at books today
um not really i tried to get her interested in this good night one but she didn't really seem like she was interested in it
lets see
and
um does how about toys at home does she have stuffed animals does she have a baby doll
she doesn't have a we don't have baby dolls um
she does have stuffed lots of stuffed animals and she does have plastic food and um ah
oh she does okay
recent that's recent she got a shopping cart from grandma for christmas and including plastic food
so um so that's a new thing
we have tons of books at home um so she's familiar with some of these things
okay
does she have any books like the ones that we have here
um yeah very similar yeah
okay
we've got doctor seuss we've got the original good night not this particular one
okay
are you makin a mess baby
so the main difference in the way played was the teething thing and so she you feel like she was chewing more
i think yeah i mean she all she always chews when she comes here but um
but yeah i think that her exclusive interest in pretty much in the food was because of that yeah
because of that alright
i think that's everything i need to ask you um
and i'm probably gonna ask you very similar things for allison
of course yup
because that's the way it works with twins
and i'll go ahead and take it out and turn it off
yeah
think we can go ahead and ask you some questions
can just play
okay
okay
did you notice anything different about what he liked today
compared to last time
yeah he liked the books even less
he's really loving the play food each time we come in
okay
i don't know if it's a novelty thing or if it's a
he's at that age where he's discovering foods and he recognizes them
that's yeah i was curious about that um are any of these things um
foods or items that he might recognize from home or from
you know what
we don't really eat cookies and
like this might look like yogurt he does yogurt
but he
but he definitely doesn't eat meat and we very rarely eat hamburgers like
he just i think he recognizes it as food though like when i bring out new foods at home
he automatically knows that it's food
even when it's not offered to him
and so he would know yogurt but he wouldn't know ice
yeah
he's never had that before
unhunh
and he may have he's seen us eat ice before though
um
and so none of these other things either
or did you see some
yeah
he like he looked
i didn't offer him anything i offered him like the peas and he was not that interested
okay
he's more interested in the hamburger like he grabbed it and tried to eat it versus you know like this which he looked at and then just set it down
he didn't i don't know
so i don't know if it's a texture thing it feels like food
tried to drink the juice
are you being shy
you being shy
so those are the main items that he looked at was um the ones you already mentioned
this one's for mommy
yeah the cookie is the main one
the main one okay
each time it's been the cookie
oops oops oops oops oops this one's for mommy
do you think is there any reason do you think he likes that one in particular
no idea
uh it could be because of because it's something he can hold in his hand
this
you think it's the right size
yeah
i think it's partially that it's kind of colorful
yeah
it's colorful
did you do any in and games
like um some kids will put drop things into the pitcher
into the pitcher no not yet
um
is he making noise with somethin
i can't remember if he was
with the book he started talking with the book
i'm trying to think with the foods he's talking to the pitcher also
yeah
he really likes the pitcher he played with the pitcher every time we've come in too
somethin he was rattling
oh the um spoons
yeah the measuring spoons where are they
oh okay
oh they're there
okay
he still has 
he liked those
so he likes things that he can do shake like that
yeah
oh i see
and then he did pay attention to some of the books right
yes
right
and first thing he did he kind of took inventory
and then he stopped and looked at the books
like he was thinking about it and then he's like no i'm gonna go for the food
and he kept stopping and looking at the books and he's like no there's not enough time
i gotta get to the food what are you doin
what are you doin
are you just loungin
silly
yeah are you bein silly
so does he like books
um
yes
yeah his brother does
yeah his favorite books are
like anything we have with um
that are like really short but still have kind of
some sort of plot like if it's just picture picture picture he's not as interested in it
or anything even if it's nonsensical that has photography with babies
like
oh interesting
very interested in other little kids
very interested
so did he pay any attention to ours
that's why i tried to get him to play with the baby and he was not interested
he did look at her
he looked at her
the baby
yeah
does he do that
yep
play peek a where are you
do you guys play
peek a
do you guys do that kind of game at home
yes
so he's done that before
yeah but usually he always waits for me to initiate it i think maybe because it's a peek a book we just played we just read
but normally i have to initiate it and quite often he waits for me to do the work
those things i'm like i see this as a pattern with both of my male children is it a
a boy thing
wait for mom to initiate it yeah
and then you can do the work
you do it
at least in my experience
oh we're losing our microphone cover
and then um i wanted to ask about the animals was he interested at all in the animals
i tried making noises with them and sta and he just he wouldn't even look at 
no okay
and then um
and he's he's been around a few animals and he's very scared of them so i think that might be part of why he's not interested in stuffed animals yet
oh okay
okay
i was thinking the dog which actually looks enough like the dog that we have that he's had interactions with that i though he would recognize but
no
nope
so he might know the name though
he might know dog and he knows
um pictures we've done pictures of and associating sounds with cows sheep ducks and horses and he seems to recognize those and anticipate those
um
frog too
i don't think frog yet
um and probably not any of the more unusual animals that you have there
yeah
i was gonna say some of these i know we haven't even
yeah
hi are you just kinda sleepy you're gonna put yourself to sleep
well let's see if there's anything i think that might be it
you guys did a great job thank you
what did you guys play with first
um the i guess the food
um does he have pretend food at home
no
no
okay
um what did he pick up that he recognizes or that he may have had before
um well i mean i guess he's seen all of this stuff twice before
but it's been a while
i dunno he's always each time he's liked to play with the plastic stuff and the food
and again it's in the middle so i don't know if that has anything to do with it
but when i try to get him interested in the other toys he seems more interested in that
um the doll he had the same reaction he had last time
which was to try and give it lots of baby kisses
so
um which foods did he pick up
the pizza and i guess the bread
and the hamburger and the salami
and then he played a lot with the plates and the spoon
which aren't food
but food related
okay
um what did you play with next
what next
um he spent pretty much the whole time playing with the food and the dishes
he stopped to eat the baby doll's face periodically
he wasn't very interested in reading books
right now
yeah we did a couple pages
do you play that game at home
yeah he loves peek a he plays it in lots of different forms
spontaneously
um yeah i try to play with him with the puppets and stuffed animals a little bit but he was mainly interested in going back and doing this kind of thing
which animals did you play with
um the kangaroo puppet
the deer
i tried to show him the zebra and the chicken and the otter but he didn't really
seem interested
okay
okay well thank you
you mind if i start asking you some questions
sure
yeah
okay what do you think um she liked to play with the most
i think she loves noise makers
okay
and uh yeah she seems to be really into the spoon which looks a lot like the kinda spoon she would eat from so that doesn't really surprise me
um and yeah she just likes to make little noises
and pick things up and see if they make soft sounds or loud sounds
she'll experiment with that stuff at home so
that's not surprising is it
is it similar to what she played with last time
it i can't remember exactly what she played with last time
i know last time she liked the measuring spoons
um but she always seems to gravitate toward the kinda food lou louder harder kinda toys and stuff
this was funny to me because since we've been here last she drinks more out of a sippy cup
so you know this i know this is a sippy cup but i wouldn't necessarily think there'd be enough things that would make her think oh i should do this and put this in my mouth
and we don't drink anything bright orange for instance we don't have a little tiny thing
hers all have little handles and the spouts different
but it was interesting to me that she understood that's a mini sippy cup and i'm going to put it in my mouth and see if anything comes out
so that's kinda funny to me
was there something that you tried to play with with her that she was absolutely not interested in
the books
you know she seemed like she had enough going on that she didn't really care about the books
and like this stuff was interesting but only in so much as can i make it make a noise when i hit it with a spoon
and if i can't okay then i'm moving back to my loud toys
so i think that she was kind of again gravitating toward the the food plastic kind of clanky sounding stuff
what were some of the animal names that are familiar to her
um dog
certainly dog maybe not poodle
but dog
um we do talk about a goose but not that much
um the ones she's really familiar with actually aren't really here
like we talk more about kind of the farm animal stuff
like the animals that would be in here she hears about a lot
frog
she hears frog
um
what were the animals in that book that
definitely like uh duck lamb or sheep horse cow a lot of and pig
i mean pretty much all these sort of farm animals are ones that she hears a lot
she has like a little play farm and then she has books that have the farm animals and we have a puzzle that's a farm puzzle
so it seems like we just have a lot of stuff that lends itself to being talked about
so she hears the sounds and we make the sounds and she plays with the different things
what is that
and at home um does she um does she prefer toys over books as well
it's funny it'll just kinda depend
um she she definitely likes being read to
and she's and we build that into her day
but i think she would prefer to be on the move right now
so reading is kinda like we're reading to her and she's playing
and then reading is like before a nap or before bed
you know she's more willing to sit on our laps and and read for a while
and then sometimes you know she'll be cuddled up and kinda quieter and we can read for a long time
so it it totally depends but she will mostly if she's in play mode books are not gonna do it for her
she's gonna wanna be like movin
does she like certain books over other books
yes
yeah
definitely
if it's a book that like she normally will like things like this that have flaps and she'll do the flaps after i do them
she definitely prefers like some of the books we have at home she'll you know kind of while we're reading it she'll do this and then she'll turn the page herself
um she's not into long stories
i mean what you would kind of expect
faces real faces real pictures seem to be something she's more into
and then we have these helen oxberry books this like set of four books that are just really sweet really simple and they are all you know illustrated they're not pictures
but it's just real simple messages and they're big baby faces that are doing things like clapping or tickling or there's a good night book
and she likes that
she'll sit and look for a long time which
when we first got these books like they have a total of like eight words in the whole book
and i'm like how is this a book
how is my kid gonna like this
i don't like this
and it's actually it's some of our favorite stuff to do
because it really just kind of cuts it down to the simple you know like up down up in the sky
you know swing low swing high
bumpity bumpity hold on tight
hush little baby say good night
and that's the whole book
but it's like she loves it and so we love it
she is just looking at you
yeah i know like hey i know that
she likes her goodnight moon
we read that
so just nothing that's like long or like we really haven't gotten into doctor seuss she doesn't seem to like as much yet
that's too a little bit longer
yeah
okay
longer story and maybe just not as interesting for her to connect with or something i dunno
what are some of the foods that might be familiar to her
um in that you played with or
well definitely cheese
we you know will have a snack of a of like pieces of of a slice of cheese
um the peas
uh certainly bread you know
little pieces of bread
or waffle
probably not so much ice we don't really eat that at home
she doesn't really see that
pizza maybe
um and i have no idea what some of these things are so
i wouldn't be really familiar
but we don't do a lot of desserts
so nothing desserty
yeah
but certainly in the last couple months she's gotten a lot more into you know we eat a lot more solid foods and baby foods now
how juices
no juice but we do uh water in the sippy cup and milk
um so she would be familiar with probably those kind of drinks
but nothing like that looks co like it has color to it
that would probably just look like something funny
i'm sure you'd figure out to try to drink it it was liquid
yeah
yeah
how um babydolls
does she have dolls at home or how did she fare with this babydoll here
she that baby doll doesn't really look anything like what she has she has kinda soft babies
um a couple of them are supposed to look human
one is like a funny yarn flower kind of doll
um
we have more stuffed animals now in the crib we found that she's more into them
um and she has like a big bunny that's really funny that has different sensory kind of noises it makes and things it can do and she will kiss that and hug that and like talk to that and the same thing with this little like one hundred doll that's at our house
that she really gets into
but not so much anything that looks like a real baby i don't think she gets that as much yet
it's just like a soft cuddly little thing at this point
are you doing like body parts and
yes we we've done that um we've got some books that have that we have some rhymes we do and then we do we're doing more like the songs
like han you know head shoulders knees and toes
we're doing that more
we have these little rhymes that we do with her
so we're doing body parts more and she seems to i don't know if i'm just projecting on her that she's getting it more but like if i'll say where's the bunny's ears and she grabs the ears i just assume that's real you know
whereas really it could just be that she likes the ears they make a good sound
but she's definitely like in the last month i've noticed a real growth spurt in terms of what she understands what she seems to be following and doing and what she associates with like the sound of the front door opening even if we're upstairs she'll immediately start crawling she knows somebody's either coming or going
and before she didn't really seem to connect that as much
and uh if we say where's mommy where's daddy you know she'll look for us
she says dada now
aw
she says nana which sometimes means i think i'm sleepy night night and sometimes i think means i'm hungry she associates being fed with like sleep
so she's starting to um do more labeling but definitely more you know understanding of language and i think some of that if i'm like you're pulling on mommy's hair she'll laugh and kind of pull more
so i think she's kind of getting some of that
maybe
i dunno
maybe i'm just projecting
but she certainly is just like in front of my eyes seems more aware of things that are going on
it's harder to trick her or get something past her
you know like if she sees something she wants and before she even gets there if i have like real quickly put it away it used to be that she would just kind be like oh that's weird i thought i knew that was there
now she looks at me and just knows
i saw that
and she'll start crawling around behind me until she finds it
and then she's like yeah i know
i knew that was there
don't even try to pull that past me anymore
so like the blackberry the remote controls the phones in the house
those are all really hard to sneak away anymore if she sees it it's like over
yeah
but it's funny i filled out that paper work
and and we have a nanny who's home with her like three to four days a week
and so i like to you know partner with her on this stuff and i want her to feel a vested interest in rosie's development and language and all this stuff
so i always leave the paperwork with her and i'm like hey let's talk about this when when i get home
like tell me if you agree or disagree with anything i put
so you know the first time she was kind of like didn't really do it
the second time she was like i think she does this and i'm like okay and then we you know we looked at or whatever
and then the next day i said hey there's some things i didn't fill out why don't you try these with her and see if she likes them like putting a cheerio in the in the bottle and see if she'll go for it
and so she got really excited about it
the nanny was like this is cool
so she was doing it and talking to me
so this time i said okay here's all the paperwork let me know and when i got home she's like you totally underestimate your daughter
aw
she's like there is so much on here that she knows and does and i'm like really
she's like yes
she knows her stroller she knows diaper she knows
i'm like she does
she's like yeah i mean abby she's like every single day i say to the kids okay we're gonna go to the stroller and they crawl to the top
and she's like now maybe they're just associating that with leaving but they know stroller means something
and if i hand rosie you know if i say diaper she'll crawl over to me
or if she thinks i'm gonna change it she'll run away but she gets it
so it was so funny because i was like oh okay
so we went through this and and the nanny was so proud of herself because she was like right
rosie does know a lot more than i have associated her with knowing
yeah
so that was like both humbling like your nanny has to tell you about your kid
but it was also a good reminder that sometimes i think we're so used to what they don't know
that we don't pick up the clues when they get it
right
so that's kinda been a a mommy epiphany i think
well you also said that you um you weren't sure you were projecting on her so you never know we use this all the time i don't know if she knows the word or knows the routine you know so
right exactly
uh it's hard
yeah
so it's certainly she's picking things up and she's getting she's getting that figured out
i sometimes worry because the other little boy in the nanny share is fifteen months
and he doesn't really have any language yet
um and you know we're a good four months behind him but she's not around a a kid who's like talking to her or engaging with her
and so that's why we really stress that we want the grownups who are around her to be creating a really language rich environment
because you know the the little boy i mean the parents are kinda worried about it and they might start doing just like looking into if there's anything cognitive there they need to be thinking about but
yeah
he's so advanced motor skills wise that i don't think they really worry about it
and then all the sudden it's like okay but he's still not saying anything okay but he's still saying anything and
so
we'll see
um they can get you know checked out uh see what they say through the infants and toddlers program in their county
yeah
we're in d c i don't even know if we have one
i feel like d c is kind of
i dunno either
but but they're both doctors so i think they've they've looked into what kinda like first steps kinda thing would be around that they could look at
he could just be a late talker
yeah
you know
all of the sudden he'll string a phrase together
i know
yeah
well that would be really cool
she is doing more like signs which is kinda fun
like she'll do more
and she'll do milk
yeah
oh
when she was sick she like went on a food strike for fifteen hours like she wouldn't eat she wouldn't
and i was kind of like worried about it and we were getting ready to go to the doctor just to check it out
and she was crying and she did the milk sign and i was like you're telling mommy that you do want to eat now you're hungry
yeah
and she came right over and she nursed and i was like oh my god this is a language breakthrough
rosie just told me what she wanted with out more than crying
yeah
just like the first year it seems like it's just crying and you determine the cry
yeah
what's in there
is that the horsie
do you feel the horsie
is that the lamb
so it looks like this is actually our last meeting for this for another
yes
like year right or something
a year
is it at two years that we come back
we'll call at twenty three months
two years old
okay
and then we try to set something up um by two years
okay
and that evaluation we just started our first round of those
wow
what's that like
what's that procedure
um it's lengthy
yeah
it's about three hours
okay
and then um we um do like a series of standardized testing
okay
and um but it looks fun
yeah
it's not it's not the s a t
right
it looks fun for them and there's snack time and bathroom breaks and stuff like that
okay
um and yeah so every every kids been kind of performing differently
yeah
um so we have so far we have one graduate clinician that is running it
okay
um so like i'll i'll have to be trained on it and things like that
yeah
so hopefully yeah i'll be here this time next year so maybe i'll be the one
that's so wild
like what will she be like
i dunno it's gonna be crazy
but i mean a year has already gone so fast that i know the next one will be a blink of an eye too
well cool
well that'll be fun baby
thank you so much
you think i can ask you some questions
sure
um what do you think sofia liked to play with the most today
uh i think the plastic stuff
food and the spoons and stuff
okay do you think um any of it was like really familiar to her
unle not unless she remembers it from last time i mean we don't have any toy food like this
maybe the spoons yeah
yeah i mean she sees spoons all the time
but um i think she just likes it mostly because it's just hard plastic stuff that she can chew on
okay
yeah
yeah
are any of these foods things that you think um at this point she might recognize the name of
uh maybe i mean we have pizza for dinner every fri i make pizza at home every friday
um
and uh she eats peas all the time
and she eats bread all the time
and i don't know her father eats waffles um every once in awhile i'm not sure if she recognizes that or not
and cheese she eats all the time
so um
yeah she might recognize those names
um how something that she liked the least
um i don't know i mean she wasn't super interested in the stuffed animals until i showed her the pooh we have pooh at home but ours is the classic pooh version so he looks a little bit different but
we call pooh and she always smi i think she recognizes the name
um got her bedroom is decorated with pooh bear so um she'll point at the pictures and go 
and uh we tell her that's pooh and she always get a real big smile so um
aw
so i know she i'm pretty sure she recognizes his name
um she didn't really i mean i didn't she mostly seemed interested in stuff that i like showed to her
except for some of this stuff she just grabbed
but um
and then the books um she kinda seemed to get a little bit bored
with them but at the beginning she was paying attention to them and enjoying it i think
usually when i try to read
i was surprised that she let me finish reading it
which book did you start with that she listened to more
um this one peek a
oh okay
do you play uh peekaboo and pattycake and things like that at home
yeah well when you say play pattycake do mean like say pattycake pattycake or do you just mean clapping
uh i think you know clap anything interactive
we do clap together all the time she loves to clap
um and i guess we don't play peekaboo that often we play so big and um
clapping and wave byebye
um
here's a book
um
so i mean i she we've read um these karen katz books before though not this particular one but um
she has a lot of books with the f lift the flap thing
and so she might be used to that and we go to um story time at the library every week and the librarian reads those a lot so
the pattycake refers to just like the action like so you have clapping in it and you have rolling in it and regardless if she's doing it you're playing it you know
yeah i mean we don't do the full patty well we do that at story time actually but um regularly at home we don't do the whole pattycake game but i'll go like sofia ya
oh okay
yay
usually she claps back
yay can you clap for mommy
ya
yay
you do it on the spot and she's like i don't think so
i don't know what i did yet
um
yay
good job
and she also waves a lot
it's funny at story time um at the beginning we sing a hello song and everybody waves
and my two year old emma i mean she just like talks and talks and talks and talks
sings and sings and sings and sings
and so anything that she's heard people say before she repeats it and every song that she's ever heard she repeats it so she'll be like singing that hello song all the time
and as soon as sofia hears her start singing it she'll start waving
aw
well that's cute
yeah
she's like i know this
i know what i'm supposed to do
that's funny
yeah
um is she drinking out of um bottles or sippy
both yeah she gets a bottle nighttime um
and uh she mostly nurses but she gets a bottle at nighttime and then um
she gets uh every once in awhile i get her i give her a sippy just emma has one and she wants it but
she doesn't drink a whole lot from it but she does
drink a little bit
and usually it doesn't have juice in it
i heard you say
no she's never had juice
neither has emma
okay
oh actually emma did have juice one time
but no they don't usually have juice we they usually have milk or water
okay
i wish my mom did that for me
now i'm all about the sugar
it's hard to i mean someday i'm sure they'll like sugar a lot no matter what i do but
but uh yeah for now they don't know what it tastes like so they don't ask for it
that's good
um was there
were there any differences to how she played you know today like um the way that she played maybe with food or the animals or the books that was different from home
the only real difference was that
hey look at you walkin like a big girl can you take another step
you're so big
whoopsie
she can take a few steps at a time now
um the only real difference was that she let me read the books
oh okay
she usually grabs away from me although the past few days she has been letting me read to her more
but mostly when i try to read to her she um she just grabs at the books
it probably helps that she was holding onto other toys
that's interesting
good to know you know
um does she is do you think she's familiar with any animal names
s um maybe i mean we have a dog and um we call her puppy even though she's four
um just she's little and crazy um
so she's probably at least she familiar with that do you know animal name um
and you know sometimes when we read books
i mean we read lots of books with animals in them but i don't know much attention she's paying to that she's either trying to grab the book away from me or she's distracted by something else and that's why she's not trying to grab the book away from me
um i'm not sure she really pays attention that but at least puppy she is probably familiar with
and maybe kitty my parents have a cat and emma calls it a kitty
okay
yeah
um this book is just like is more like touch and feel so sometimes i think that that is interesting to her or
well the first one i mean i starte i read her this i think second and on the first page she wanted to feel that
but then she got bored of it and she didn't wanna look anymore
and she started playing with her toys
now you wanna play with it
yeah
but things like um farm animals are like horses cows
i don't i mean i doubt if she i mean she's heard us talk about them before and she's seen us read books but
oh thank you for the hug
um but like i said i mean i don't think she pays a whole lot of attention to the books so i don't know if she's like if you if i showed her a picture of a cow if she would remember like oh i've seen that before
you know i don't know
yeah
you know i don't know it's hard to tell
yeah
do you keep her engaged by animals like animal sounds
like to
uh
no not really i mean um
if i'm trying to get her attention i'll go like
or sofia
i mean we do mostly like talking and singing and stuff
um
was that fia or ia
sofia
oh you said sofia
i think so
oh okay
no you probably did and i heard the last part sorry about that
emma used to call her fia
and we a little friend emma's age that calls her fia too
i love her pigtails
thanks
they're really cute
thanks
they're really cute
yeah
well i think that's all the questions unless you wanted to add something
um no i don't think so
okay well we have i'm gonna stop the recording
okay
ice cream
yeah yeah
uh huh
you're gonna go help aren't you
are you
do you like papers
i wish i had i should have like a pretend record form
for them to tear apart
here you want the book it's kind of like it
hi
oh your up you want to get oh look at that
a pink one
that's a dog
uh huh
he's pretty friendly huh
he goes to anybody
that is so sweet
well what do you think about how he's playing with the toys and what he's interested in compared to last time you were here
um he's
any differences
less interested in the stuffed animals this time till the very end there um last time he was kind of equally interested i think
um and then the um the books he likes the books more it seems this time
but he's been reading a lot more books at home lately
in you know his spare time
was he so he uh looked like maybe he would like to turn pages
yes
yeah that's something in the last couple weeks he's started doing
he'll pick up a book and starting flipping through and just looking at the pages
right
right
so he did like some of those then
yeah the one withs with the uh the touchy feely stuff and yeah
he likes those and then the lift flap books
okay uh
i think
then he likes this stuff the hard toys in the middle
and do you think that's why he likes them
i think there hard and there something he can pick up and bang together and uh
and make knock down stacks that mommy makes
come back here your quick
aren't you quick come here
mommy wants you she does
come here can you walk to me
wow almost
not in these shoes it's the shoes that are killing him
oh
i know
um so you said he looked at everything but he
he seemed the middle stuff the hard stuff he played with the most
okay were there any items that he tended to like
the peas he always like the peas
alright and anything else that he liked in particular
um the ice creams and the peas just but i don't know if it's for color or familiarity or
if it's familiar
has he had anything like pizza
yeah well he's had some bites of it but most of his are cut up
so they don't look like this
they don't look like this
the peas are probably the one thing that look like what he's used to getting
but look you have it now
of course now you want the pizza
and the cookie the cookie he likes the cookie
okay
has he so besides cut up pizza and peas has he tasted any of these other
um yeah the cookies the waffle um
hamburger i mean he's had a lot of the lunch meat and stuff
spaghetti we've had spaghetti
you're gonna pizza on spaghetti
thank you
you're a good sharer
we'll switch
there you go
um and the any of the um plates and that the non food things
he eats off his tray right now so he's not plates go flying right so we don't mess with plates
okay
right
and he did like that
the pitcher he likes to put things in and out
so it was less the pitcher as a function and more pitcher as a place to put things
that sounds right that sounds right huh
um and then do you did he recognize the bottle or sippy cup as something that you think he would've
he didn't seem too
are there any of the food items do you think he's um would recognize the names of
probably not
okay
and then let's see oh animals um does he would he recognize the names of any of the animals
um maybe doggie
um the doggie
doggie and kitty are the only ones we really do a lot of at home so
you were going through some there must be a book over there with farm animals
that was this one the feeling yeah
oh yeah
and do you think he would recognize any of those
uh probably not
or the names of the either the pictures of them or the names
we've told him the names of them in books and stuff like that i don't know if he would uh you know directly recognize
if they
familiarity um he's heard them but maybe not a lot
yeah exactly
dog like i said doggie kitty and probably bird turtle things that he sees at friends houses and stuff like that we probably see the most
um and then any of the did was he interested in any of the unusual animals that we have here
that he probably would not have seen at a friend's house
um it didn't seem that way but
of course i mean this is not exactly
he's kind of unusual he has a hat on
exactly
not too many animals you see like that
um alright and then oh do you have i'm sure other people have asked you this before but i don't think i have anyway i don't remember
if you have any toys like these at home or at daycare if he's in daycare
um he's not in daycare
we have books we have stuffed animals no fake food um but lots of blocks and stuff he likes to stack
he seemed to like that right
the knocking down
yes he loves making stacks and knocking them down
okay
thank you for the hug that was very sweet
oh good kisses and hugs you're such a lovey
thank you
okay and so you told me what seemed different from last time
is he um playing with things differently than maybe last time
um a lot more of the in and out
oh
thank you baby
um a lot more of the flipping of the pages in the books
um that's about it that's probably the biggest change in the last month is the you know just doing the more of the in and out
so in and out of containers
yep
you're lovey today what do you want
yeah he's a nice boy is he tired
uh yeah he does do that a lot but if he wants something he'll pretend like he loves you
he does it to daddy all the time
does that already
oh my goodness
he'll give him he'll give daddy a hug to get closer to something
well yeah pretty smart boy huh
he says i like to think so
peas and spaghetti
peas and spaghetti
but it is lunchtime so that
yeah
i think i um
you want them back
did he look at the babydoll at all
he looks looked at her briefly he played with her more last time than this time um
bring it over here silly boy
oh hi
there we go
where you going you gonna try to walk again
hi
so he looked at her more last time
yeah i mean he looked at her and kinda just acknowledged her but didn't he doesn't you know want to play with her
do you have any baby dolls at home
no we don't
okay
i think that's all
no babies
i think that's it
i'm gonna go ahead and turn this stuff off
okay
he won't be back till he's two
oh no
um at least not for this study i should say
yeah
we have
what interested her
well you know everytime we come here
she always grabs that bottle
and
oh so she remembers the bottle
yeah
but i th i think it's because it is a bottle
you know
um that she grabs gravitates towards that
and then like all the food toys this time she was putting in her mouth
oh
um like in th in the first thing she picked up when we came in was the peas
and last time she was attracted to the peas as well
oh
this time i showed her to clap the um the blocks
to she sa saw that it made a sound
you like that
so then she was doing it
and then with the circular cylinder shaped blocks
but then she picked up the pizza and she noticed there was more pizza over there so she went to go get all of them
oh okay
and then she started to shh tap the pizza together to see if she could make the sound with the pizza but
you know it's like she picked it she saw it like made a beeline for it and then came back and then she looked and saw that there was more so um
all of the food stuff
the waffle she put in her mouth
the ice i said we ju we her sister just had an ice cone
oh okay
and so maybe you know she recognized that
but she i said ice and she went to go put it in her mouth
um we took tried to take it the real ice away from her and she had a fit
so maybe she remembered that you know the ice experience from the other day
she still eating it
this one is
i joke and say it's her favorite toy she hates this thing
i mean like
don't
it is so funny the reaction she gives when like she thinks
but then she was getting brave today
she came and sat on me and she actually pulled it
oh okay
but then when i go to put it next to her she's she makes a fit
she doesn't like it
does she know what that's called
a bee
she knows
i don't know if she knows a bee
no i think what it is is this these things
oh okay
they look alive
she doesn't like it
we have a kooshball at home too that she does not like
and her sister doesn't
i play tricks on both of them and put it ne close to them
they realize it's there and they take off running
but she does not this thing right here is not her favorite
clearly it's not her favorite
okay
and clearly she doesn't like
she even jumps if it she thinks its co going to her
see
you see her face
she's like get that thing away from me
she doesn't like it
she likes that
the sp well she just picked the spoon up
the whole time she didn't
even the measuring spoons
and then i use these too when cooking you know so
so she she knows it
she probably yeah it's like whatever they're just spoons
but um i just noticed this time
she didn't last time i was trying to get her to clap the blocks and she didn't do it
but this time i did it and she wanted to do it as well so she liked the blocks
the baby and you know she plays with the babies
we have several babies at home
different ethnicity uh babies as well
and she she just throws them about
i mean you know it's no big no big love affair that she has with the babies
but and then a plethora of stuffed animals so maybe the toys the stuffed animals um she so too familiar with them she's like oh i can play with those at home i don't wanna play with those
i have these food type blocks and toys and um she does have a play bottle at home it's muc it's a little smaller than that one
and she does the same thing
she puts it straight to her mouth like she's gonna feed herself
um and of course she sees this and automatically knows its a cup
okay
and she we i'm trying to stop her from breastfeeding now
but um um she's been more taken more to the bottle and to cups
and and she wants to drink out of what you have
so maybe this is because even though it's smaller and it's clearly a toy
maybe it's because it's familiar with her at home of drinking out of the maybe she's familiar with it you know from home from drinking out of it at home
um
was there anything else that she liked to play with
it looked like she preferred the toys over the books
she de i tried to read her we tried to get her like to look at the books even the peekaboo book which the last time she at least i could get her to look and and then for a quick you know couple of seconds
but this time she didn't even want to look at it
she wasn't wasn't even bothered
but it looked like she was gonna turn the page help me turn the pages of this book here
but then she got bored really quickly
and it's it's crazy because we read books everyday at home
and not little books but like big picture books and you know
good night and things like that
she enjoys sitting
and i don't know maybe it's because of uh her sister
she has we have a three year old at home
so um and micah is definitely trying to learn how to read
but uh and quinn because she just is trying to emulate her sister
maybe it's why
oh
but here by herself i don't want to read any books i want to play with the toys
what
are you finished
yeah
are you done
you wanna play with the microphone
that's not a toy though
i don't think i have any more questions for you
okay
i think you're all done
alrighty
alrighty
for playing with me and mommy
ready to go bye bye
ready to go bye bye
alrighty
oh and the keys i didn't mention
she wouldn't put the bottle down for the longest until i gave her the keys
and then she dropped the bottle to play with the keys
but she loves keys
you love keys

i think she went she loves the food and baby this time again
the she loves that babydoll
so this time she was like really really really into the baby though
okay
like she likes the baby
and the play food she loves play food
she loves food in general so i think
i think she just is not a fussy eater
so i think that's why she enjoys that
so
do you have play food at home
we do now
yes
because of here
i realized how much she enjoyed it while we were here so i've bought some
oh great
so now she plays with it all the time yeah
yeah
she likes the keys
she likes things that rattle um
things that she likes music a lot
like to dance and clap and all
so that kind of stuff goes hand and hand with it
any little instrument we have she plays with a lot
um what foods did you play with
she liked the pizza
yeah
and she liked the ice
okay
and she liked the baby bottle
and oh she played with the peas
and she likes the spaghetti too
because it's so bright
okay
but
what other items
um
she liked the books
she really likes these karen katz books right here
these
she has she doesn't have this one at home but she has a lot of them at home
and she likes she i mean she's pretty interested in the animal book
not as much as she usually is but she was interested in that one so
um do you play the game in the karen katz book
oh we do play peekaboo
yeah
yeah she enjoys peekaboo a lot
um what animals um were in the on the book that she's seen before
um oh she's seen all of these
yeah horses she sheep dogs
yeah she's seen we have a lot of these at home a lot of not this one specifically but a lot of farm animals and animal books so
she's seen them all
what other books did you all read
um just k today just this one
i started to read the foot she just wasn't she was wasn't interested in it
okay
um but that's it today
um at the end you started to play with stuffed animals
which ones did you play with
she this bee
this is the one that she loves
she the hair i guess
but i dunno the colors
she really likes the bee
um she went to the chihuahua again
this this one she went to before
our neighbor has one i don't know if that's why or just it's pink
she had no interest in the puppet
like she really she's not a big stuffed animal person
yeah
baby girl
she's okay
she um even at home she she gravitates more towards things that make noise and that she can manipulate a little bit more than stuffed animals
she's not not too interested in them
um does she recognize what what the what the puppet is or has she seen that animal before
a kangaroo
uh i think there's only like one book we have at home that has a kangaroo in it
so i don't think she's really familiar with a kangaroo
okay
what other names did you call this
chico
our neighbor's dog is chico
and we always see chico
like every day we're out talking to chico
and and um we don't play with chico he bites but
but they know who chico is
alright
um there were other there were two other food items you didn't mention
um this one
oh the waffle
that's her brother loves waffles
aw
and he likes we have a play waffle at home and loves playing with that
like he's put it in the microwave he's done things he shouldn't with the waffle like he's always has the waffle with him
and so he likes that one
and the peas she did play wi
did i mention the peas
yeah you did
yeah
um you didn't mention
oh the cookie
yeah
that's a i don't she doesn't eat cookies yet or anything but maybe she sees her brother
but she like
or maybe it's the colors on it
but she did like the cookie yeah
okay
and you didn't mention these
oh the plates
has she started um
i don't she doesn't really use plates yet because she throws them on the floor
aw
she but she does see her brother
um she observes her brother like n like typical second sibling so she probably sees him use plates
but i think i was putting food on the plate for her
she wasn't doing it by herself
okay
here so
you like the cookie
yeah
alrighty well you guys did a great job
okay
so now i'm gonna ask you some
questions yes
that's good
she's all over the place um
she is
i know you guys always want to know what do i think is her favorite
oh yes so what you think was her favorite
that's a tough call probably the baby
and she always loves the food
i tell i think i tell you guys every time i think it's just because we have so much of it at home it's all over the place you know we have the kitchen with the older daughter and
so this kind of stuff is she sees it a lot it's everywhere
not necessarily the exact same things but similar ones you know
plastic food
oh she sees plastic food a lot
plastic food ye ye ye
ye she plays with that like her sister's always trying to feed her plastic food you know what i mean make meals for her and that kinda stuff ye
so she sees plastic food a lot
and in the past she's always loved the keys
so i said even to her right away look somebody has the keys apart this time they usually they're on a
and she loves the jingling the the noise they make
that and like these spoons
if the spoons were all connected she would have right away gone to those two
she didn't even touch these
they're all separated
i thought that was very interesting
she loves anything that makes a noise that she can jangle like that
so she loves the keys and the spoons when they're together and i noticed they were apart this time that was very interesting
i wonder if that's they're older just to see what they do with them
i don't know why that is
maybe some did that
ha
ye maybe
that's why i said maybe someone tore apart
like you
like a destructor baby like you
ye they have been on a a ring in the past and there's the other one
so maybe it was just a fluke
maybe it wasn't supposed to be on purpose
ye i don't know
that's kinda funny
and here's all these little spoons usually are connected too
or at least they have been
now the food she saw plastic food do you think she recognizes does she see those real foods like does she see pizza
pizza she does yes
peas
she hates peas but she has to eat 
ice
she does love regular ice
she kept picking up the jar of peanut which i thought was interesting she's never eaten peanut
and i it's not like i she would i don't you know she's not even really around when i'm making a peanut butter sandwich for her sister you know
so that she definitely doesn't um
the bottle and the juice both she tried to drink herself you know
with both right away
the pizza she's fascinated with i don't know why
we don't eat pizza with any of that stuff on it at our house
i don't know if it's it has a lot of the colors
do you think that she knows it's pizza
i don't know
i don't know
i i wish i knew i don't know
she might but i just don't know
she will eat pizza
she will that
hi
she loved readin the books she likes the fuzzy book
she does like that
and she loved the baby i've never it's the first time she's ever leaned in and given it a kiss
that was the first time we had ever done that she gave
the baby a kiss
didn't you
you gave the baby a kiss
and i asked the other girl i had asked the other girl before i came in i said do you want me to like try and get her to talk like in her bika bika words or do you want me to just not
you know i don't want do you want me to not influence her
and she said whatever i wanted to do is fine
she talks like bika bika all the time and we have like bika conversations like bika bika oh bika bika bika bika
now what is she
you know like it's just a sound she makes
and so we just imitate it back to her all the time and so then we have these conversations in bika language i call them
oh and she starts
she started it yes it was all it was her starting it
and and
but see like i'll say bika to her and then she'll go oh bika bika bika you know what i mean
so i influenced her and started it here but she came up with the word herself i don't even know when a long time ago
and
bika bika and that's just kinda
what is that and it will refer to whatever you're doing
anything exactly whatever you're doing at the time yep
cause i noticed you
anything in any situation yep
right
so now it's just a word that she just uses
it's just a made word she uses for anything yep
when she ye to replace whatever she can't say ye
she really only says like momma dada baba and baby
yeah she's pretty talk talkative
ba
addressed to the child
baby
yes you're the baby
bika bika bika
now so the food was definitely the big hit and she has that stuff at home
and then you noticed she kissed the doll this time
does she play with dolls at home
uh she does but not a ton but she does have 
we do have at home and she does play with them at home
ye she does like the babydolls at home too
a baby
a baby
she hasn't ever like tried to tear the clothes off or dress or undress yet or anything like that
but she picks up and carries them around you know and they're draggin by their feet and stuff like that she does
whenever like they have little high chairs her sister puts them in the high chairs and she'll pull out
she puts them in the stroller she pulls out
you know
and she's fascinated by their hair a lot of time she's like
you know pulling out their hair
i said that's you don't have any
that's you don't have any of your own
see we're still playing with the food i don't i don't know why
and um the books were
you're klutzy
uh this one i know she likes
i think i did the same ones as last time i know she likes them
and the peekaboo baby one
she i knew they capture her attention
you know like read something like this she wouldn't have listened for that long
she would have for a couple minutes but she prefers the interactive stuff at this age
she would have you know gotten up or hit me or thrown it or pulled it away from me or somethin
because she'll sit like when i read her sister books at night she'll she'll sit for the first few minutes of it and then she's squirming or grabbin at it or wantin to put it in her mouth or you know it's a a more advanced book you know
from what her sister would pick or somethin so
but she's sittin longer and longer you know it's gettin a little bit better she'll sit for a little more of it
and i know that gets better with age too
but these those two are so good because the feeling and then the peekaboo
and do you have any of these
um i we have some of those i don't think she's ever touched them though
i don't know if we even have those exact two
we have good night not the counting one
we have the regular good night
she's heard that one um the peekaboo we don't have it but we've had it at the library
and then the feely one we actually um were playing with a little boy yesterday while sissy was at soccer who had the a book very similar and had feely stuff in it so that's why so we did this book yesterday
it wasn't ours though we just it was just borrowed so we don't have that
right
we don't have that one
now the clock i didn't know if she'd be interested or not just because of the feel of it foamy
she looked at it for a few minutes but then
ye nothin there to capture her too much whereas her sister would have loved it she's interested in telling all of the time even though she has no concept of it
she's always like what time is it mommy
and i'm like do you have somewhere to go
what do ya have a date
ye i'm like it's two o'clock why
when will it be five o'clock
in three hours
is that a long time
i'm like in my world not really but in your world probably
in your world probably
you know
um and what about the animals
the stuffed animals
i tried a little bit with her but she didn't she didn't seem to want to pick up and play with them herself though
she she thought they were funny she laughed when i was you know doing em on her belly and
we have a whole bin of those things at home though and the girls don't play with them a whole ton
usually they're just thrown all over you know just to empty out just to throw but they don't play with them a lot
they don't treat like a babydoll or anything like that
but we have lot's of those don't we
so i tried to do a little bit of everything just to see what she would prefer
obviously her favorite thing is walking
yes
walking around all over the place
she really likes things that play music make noise
that kinda stuff
so everything is so interactive now everybody's so a d d i guess
she loves all the stuff with the lights and noise and we have a lot of those kinds of things
mostly hand from sissy but they were
and she's a dancing baby
aren't you
aw
are you a dancing baby
whenever she hears music
can you show your dancin
you wanna do dancing baby
can you do dancing
shake your butt do your dancing baby
we have the ones that are like the magnetic things on the fridge and if you push the button it you know sings a song
ye
i see you dancing dancing dancing dancing dancing dancing
dancing dancing dancing dancing dancing right
ye
you'll just shake that whole butt of yours won't you
you can't shake it when you're sixteen
so if you had had any toys like that in there she would have liked those too you know
oh like a light up kind of thing interactive ye
with music ye buttons are good she would have loved anything like that too
this is the good old stuff though right
ye this is the good old toys
this is what mamma had to play with momma didn't have all those fancy light up things you have nowadays
crazy
say crazy
what do you see
what do you see
oh water bubbler
so she was really she had a look at everything
uhoh
but it was mostly the food
mostly the food and the baby
ye the food and the baby got the
and then those two books she did enjoy
she did actually sit through those
that was good
and willing to read all the pages with me in that one book
and every time we did you know for some reason she just i don't know why
but we're working on it
oh she does it ye ye she does this
oh that's funny
that's what the baby does
and instruments see we have a lot of used instruments my daughter loves that we play guitar and drums and you know little
so this
now the older one has and and she loves them
you know tambourines
so that's those types of toys are her favorite so we didn't have any of her favorite but we did have ones that
those are the kind of stuff she loves yes
not that she doesn't like anything like she
she's perfectly fine
well you know what
perfectly entertained
alright so what do you think his favorite toy was this time
besides the camera and the cord um
i think the sippy and the spoon were the two that he seemed to play with the most
why do you think so
i think he's hungry
it's he's ready for lunch
gotcha
he always tries to take the spoon out of my hand and play with it and then and he's he hasn't had anything to drink in a little bit so he's probably just hungry and thirsty
do you think he recognizes those things
yes
yes definitely
i bet a lot of it he probably doesn't recognize but the sippy and the spoon and the bottle
i think he definitely does
and he loved the ice cones last time and this time and so i don't know if he recognizes them or not or if he just likes to chew on 
you know what i mean like he likes the shape of or whatever so
yeah
we don't usually get this kind of cone
but
so yeah he always he's always always gravitates towards plastic toys he's never been into the stuffed animals he'll play with books at home
mostly to take them off the shelf and throw them but
the stuffed animals he's never interested in
mkay
so you think he recognizes any of the food then besides the
um
maybe the pizza
and the cheese
yeah
i'm gonna say that's probably i don't know that's probably about it
so what did he like last time you said the ice
the ice cones
the ice cones and the ice sundae well and he might and you know what he might recognize those like that's been one of his favorite things lately is when we eat ice he loves to have some
so
so i think yeah maybe he might recognize the ice
and that doesn't really look like pasta so i don't know if he'd recognize that
i agree
maybe the bread
he's we've started givin him bread lately
so
do you think he recognizes any of the stuffed animals
i don't think so i mean we read books and talk you know i'll point out animals and stuff he doesn't seem to be real engaged
he likes to play with those little farm toys but he doesn't real interest like he doesn't seem real interested in stuffed animals and so it's hard to tell
he likes when we make noises and stuff but then he's like kinda done with it
right so
yeah
and i think he likes to play with the eyes on the doll
which makes me nervous my sister's gettin ready to have a baby
and he'll poke the baby in the eye
oh man
that's why i always try to treat dolls like real kids
huh
hi
how's that spoon
say it better food on it
yeah you are hungry
and he's still teething so he has no teeth yet so he chews on anything he can get in his mouth
oh
and i think that's part of the reason he likes to play with the pla the hard toys compared to the soft toys
he's never played with soft toys
oh that makes sense
gentle nathan remember
look gentle there you good job
not in the eye though
you're a good listener
do you um use a lot of words of encouragement when he does something right or
yeah i mean i try to i try to
unfortunately you know most of the time he ends up going for the outlet or the video camera or the cord or the you know so he spends a lot of time doing that so yeah i'll we we try to look out for that and and do as much words of encouragement as we can
does he gravitate towards toys that make noise
he likes them um but that's not like the only he'll play with like
we try you know and it's funny i think when i think about it i think all of our noise making toys are in one room and like all of his other toys you know what i mean and like not on purpose i think that's just how it worked out but
um
nathan no
and you're gonna try to cr crawl climb up that aren't you
come here come see mama
i'm gonna get you
ooh
good boy
um he does like he does like toys that make noise but
like there's some toys when we turn off he enjoys them just as much when they're not making noise so he likes to play with a lot of stuff that doesn't make noise too
so it's probably half and half
so do you think he um likes certain toys certain colors or textures
definitely like hard plastic better than like soft stuff
um
i'm tryin to think if we've got like wood toys or anything like that
he definitely likes bumpy stuff um if something's got like a you know some kind of pattern texture on it he likes that
um
i'm tryin to think of what else
nathan
stop
yeah i think that that's probably the most of it and he likes he likes chewin on board books he likes chewin on paper he loves chewin on paper
that's always a challenge he tries to choke on that too
um
but yeah i think mostly just the the harder toys and then if there's like a bumpy some soft of bumpy texture on it he likes that
basically anything that feels good on his gums
is is really wants to but he's started like he has a shape sorter at home
and he loves playin with that and he started putting shapes into the box and trying to put it through the right holes
um
he never quite gets them the right direction but like he'll put the circle over the circle hole and
you know and so i think he's starting to get that like different shapes and and stuff like that he's startin to learn that
and he's figured out he loves um he has a little people barn and like there's certain doors that open and close that make noises and stuff and he loves moving he's figured out how to move all the things that makes noise and he likes to do that
um
that's really good
then he also likes to just carry the little people around with and chew on them and whatever
yeah and he'll put like he'll definitely put stuff in and take stuff out of of buckets and he's got a train that's got like the balls that come out of the top and he'll grab and he'll put back in and
so
he the the the the putting in and taking out has been his latest favorite thing to do
um
oh i wanted to ask if you remember what his favorite toy was on the first visit
the first visit he was just kinda playin with all of the food toys
and i think it was like i don't know if it was this one but it was like one of these like i think rectangular kind of things
maybe like this one he was probably smaller then
but yeah it was just i think it was one of these little things i don't know
yeah i think it was just one of these
ooh you know actually you know what it was it was i think there was like a can of peas or maybe this
i think this like one of these things
uhoh
oh good
yeah
so he's been consistent with the food
just on
and i think now he's startin to recognize more of it too since he's eating more like real food
yeah
so
alright
he definitely gets excited when we get when we pull a cracker out like he recognizes the package of crackers
and he's like like i was puttin it in the diaper bag earlier and i thought he was gonna jump out of his skin and then he's like what you're not givin me one
so
that's funny
yeah
alright so that's all the questions i have
and then he doesn't come back he's two or somethin right
i have a few questions for you
um what toys do you think hailey was not interested in
maily the stuffed toys again
which ones in particular did you show her
uh i showed her like the two otters she wasn't interested in that
i guess she took interest in the winnie the for like five seconds
but
aw
she really seems to be interested in these mainly
okay
um so i know i don't think she's had many of these foods
no not too many
but um which ones do you think she was interested in or did she pick up
she spent a lot of time with this ice
and the peas
and like at home she really likes spoons
um any kind of spoon
like she has this wooden spoon at home that she uses like she plays with
i don't know how we found out that she likes wooden spoons but it's become her favorite one of her favorite toys
so she definitely played with the spoons here
um which other ones did she
um besides the ice and
the spaghetti
um and
woah
um uh a little bit of the plates
and the peas
okay
mainly
that's it
um which of these foods do you think she'll be having in the future or do you guys have at home that she doesn't have
uh she eats pasta
she'll be eating more of that
she loves cheese at home
she's never had ice or pizza
or waffles
but um i imagine she'll have that in the future
um how the cups do you think she recognized this
i think so
yeah
yeah
she put it to her mouth for a little bit but quickly lost interest when it didn't give her any juice
oh now you found it again
so you don't think she recognizes what's in what's inside
i think she does
it's i mean she doesn all her bottles are filled with milk but i know she knows there's something in there
she's trying to get it out but
you're not having success
it's impossible
hailey
um i know she wasn't interested in one of the books you picked up
right
yeah shh at home she listens to books but it has to be when she's ready for it
oh okay
she's taken an interest to books lately
like within the past month
um so she'll sit down for three or four books at a time
do you have any of these books at home
not any of these no
do you play that game at home
oh yes
we do
yeah
yeah she just started doing it herself like playing peekaboo
being the one to hide
but
yeah that was a lot within the past month she's been doing so
okay
she was interested in the doll does she have dolls at home
no
she doesn
well she has ones but they're less realistic they're more like stuffed
like the really infant type of the infant friendly type
um
okay
but they they don't really resemble one of those babydolls very much
okay
hailey
what are you doing
um similar colored um shoes
yeah
yeah
yeah she pretty much plays with anything and everything at home
like she used to only be interested in things that made noise but now she'll pick up like a spoon and be interested
and anything really
paper even
anything she really shouldn't be into she's that's her favorite now
so
how about these
she wasn't too interested in those
i know they make n
yeah
she p i tried to get her to play with those but she wasn't really interested
um also a few other of the food objects
um do you think do you have this at home
um we don't have any toys like that
but anything like i said anything she shouldn't be into she gets into so she would probably pick that up at home and try to play with it so
most likely
but we don't have any toys like that in that shape or anything
okay
we don't have any of the play food
she seems to be interested so maybe we'll get her some
yeah
um also under your foot
can you pick that up
yeah shh
do you think she'll be having any of those any time soon
probably
within the next few months but for now we're keeping her limited of allergies
okay
just in case but
yeah she'll probably have that
in a few months
and she likes bread
don't you
you like bread at home
not here
no
no not here
okay
well you guys did a great job
alright
and thanks for coming
you're welcome
hailey say thank you for letting me drool all over your toys
the theme for today is things i can put in my mouth and chew
okay so i just wanna ask you some questions about what you did
um i noticed you playing a lot with the food
which items did he uh like
oh well he was eating the peas the both this main spaghetti
spaghetti
um there's one that has the meat sauce but he wasn't playing so much with that one
and then the pizza
and but the peas and the spaghetti seem to be his favorite
and do you remember which of the dessert items you might have showed him
i showed him this but he didn't seem real interested in the dessert
i showed him the ice cone too
and he didn't
now he does
but he didn't want it before
becau that's pretty much what he
how this one joe
oh he did pick the cookie up
he did find the cookie on his own and he did eat the cookie
huh there you go with the
you know how to make it go in your mouth
but yeah then he went for the clock and then
but he did play with the baby for a little bit
and he did pick up the the sippy cup
which is weird he doesn't drink out of one
he doesn't drink out of them
he he won't drink out of it
he prefers a cup if he's
does he not like sugary things
no
he um he gets one bottle of juice a day but he um he drinks mostly out of a bottle or a cup now he he just won't drink out of a sippy
he'll chew the tip of the sippy cup but he won't eat drink out of it
and then they all fell out and they gotta go in again
that's right
but yeah he played with the baby for a little bit gave the baby a hug
so but but yeah i i showed him the sheep and the frog and the uh i didn't get to the the pooh bear and uh the this one and he wasn't interested in the stuffed animals today
yeah
do you remember what you told him that was i know some people get confused
oh with this
the otter
yeah i think some people get confused about it
yep nope i called it i said otter and he just kinda looked at like whatever
and the frog you're like whatever
he's like i got my food and things i can stick in my mouth and bite stuff
does he know about utensils and things like that
he does
and i handed him a spoon and he i think oh he that's right what did he
where did i put it
here it is
he went like that which is what he usually does
he he uses the wrong end usually
but he didn't put it in his mouth
uh do you remember if there are other foods you showed him
um
that he might recognize from home
i he ate the he was trying to eat the toast
but i made a sandwich and he was uh would take the piece of toast
is what he would take
each time
and everytime i put something on the plate he would take it right off which is what he does at home so
you dump everything huh
dump everything onto your tray so you can pick it apart
does he know which foods are for breakfast and which for foods are for
i don't think so
no
they're all the same to you huh
yeah he's just like stuff to eat but he really likes the peas
how this one you like this one
yeah
yeah i showed him
you chew on this one
i showed him that and was like yeah that's what your brothers eat for breakfast but he didn't seem to really didn't seem to really care at the time
but now it's just let's put everything in our mouth and chew
yeah
huh
uh what what all else did he put in his mouth
that was pretty
that was pretty much it
he played a little bit with the keys but not very much
i guess it doesn't have the same clanging sound as as car keys so
yeah the real ones
mommy's keys they make a cool sound
but every time i put the pizza all six slices back into a pie he would take at least two of them out so
but yeah he didn't seem to really
those peas
he's really really into the peas and the spaghetti
you wait three years from now you won't want to touch those
it's like which is weird he went
thank you
he ate before we came
and he had a lot of food too
thank you
oh thank you
he's like what ya doin
is that a piece of paper
can i play with it
yes
do you remember if you showed him any other animals
no it was it was pooh bear and these
oh i tried to show him the bee
but he was
you weren't having that were you
no he did not want to look at the bee and the sheep
yeah go open some foods
he goes ah the wires
it's the other fun thing to play with at home huh
yes
well i think that about does it joseph
you were really good today
yep
yeah baby has shoes
yep that's what you do with your shoes too huh
do you eat your shoes too
yes he does
is it okay if i ask you some questions
yeah
um so uh tell me about what you guys played with
um he was really interested in the food
he was he likes he's still teething so it's everything in his mouth chewing on everything
um he doesn't eat um a lot of solids yet still so like he doesn't know like this is pizza that's ice or anything yet
but um
yeah
but he definitely um is interested in self feeding with a spoon so he was into the spoons and tried to you know imitate feeding himself and with the bottle and the sippy
um so yeah he was into those
he's not he's still not really into the stuffed animals they don't do anything for him
um
um and then the baby he was into a little bit
and the peekaboo book
who's got you
yeah see if you can play with that
that's really fun
they're magnets just like on the fridge
he's like no
um yeah so still i think last time i said oh he likes things that make noise he's still into um anything that makes or he can teethe on
and his new skill seems to be throwing things so he threw a few things
um and i was trying since i mean he doesn't really know like frozen peas or tacos or anything so i was using these as blocks to knock them to build a tower for him to knock down he likes to do that at home with his we have like um solo cups that we stack up and nest and everything and he likes that
that's the baby's face
yeah you gonna get her
be gentle
um
were there any foods in particular you were or um i think i noticed he was playing actually with the bottle a lot
yeah he was playing with the bottle
he occasionally takes a bottle at home and a sippy at home too
so that was kind of um
there's the teething
um so i think he was like oh bottle you know sippy
i know those things
um
what does he usually get in them
um in the bottle it's breast milk and the sippy is water
so he is not familiar with juice he hasn't had juice
um the reason why he's been slow on solids is because we think he has food allergies so
okay
that's why he's like not so familiar with all that stuff
okay
were there any like food names that maybe you say at home or you're trying to teach him or
um he probably is familiar with the word ice the words ice
not because my mother in says um daddy come home bring john an ice cone kinda like a rhyme
um but he wouldn't associate that well with ice cone necessarily i don't think
um dairy is one of the things that we think he has a sensitivity to so
okay
um apple he may recognize apples there was apple juice
um he gets apple sauce at home
um but everything else he really we haven't really worked on like food words because he's not really getting a lot of food
but the peas
he really i think he really liked their texture
um
you're just cracking yourself up over there
um yeah i think he liked the texture
uh he's had pee puree before but he wouldn't necessarily look at this and say oh that's peas you know
it's been a puree
and then um what about the
i can get it
okay
the baby
how did you guys play with the baby
um he's really interested in shoes and socks lately
so i tried to um
and i always point out babies when we seem them
so um i tried to get him interested on the in the shoe and the baby
oh okay
yeah
oh is the baby having an ice cone
whoops
hi there
um
so you talk about like body parts and clothing
yeah um yeah we yeah
we try to i'm teach trying to teach him like nose head hair that kinda thing
shoe yeah
you like to show off shoes when you find them
you really like shoes and socks
do you think he knows that word
i think so
because um he's always going to them at home and showing them to me or pointing to them
and typically when he's doing he's familiar with it
you know what i mean like
oh no
um good boy
wanna come here
come get the baby
yes
the baby wants to give you a hug
um yeah what's that a pitcher
um yeah like his hats he loves hats and
no
come here
come back here
yes
good boy
oh yeah what's that
pizza
um yeah so things that he is trying to show me or you know calling my attention to i think are things that he's done in the past a lot
and he's he knows okay this is something i've seen before you know
it's a sock or a shoe
wow
okay
and then um you said body parts
which ones do you think he's more fascinated with or you've been working on with him
nose
he likes noses
um face
um and then feet and hands and fingers
um and tongue
i didn't say any of those things i i don't remember saying that
but um you know those are the things
oh he's going for it
hey john
uhoh
your sock's coming off too
come on let's go over here
here we go
were there any um any of the books that you played with or
um yeah we played with the peekaboo book that's his favorite game i mean he's always
like sometimes he'll like if we're in my room at home we'll he'll crawl around the bed and kinda like le
like when whenever he does this motion i know he's like trying to do peekaboo whether it's whether something's in front of him or not
he gets this look on his face
um so that's yeah that's his favorite so i thought he might like that the you know hide and seek book
of course it didn't hold his ten attention for very long when there were things to chew on
but um
yeah i think we have this book at home we haven't looked at it too much but
oh maybe not
baby animals is something that we have
um i thought maybe i'd show him something that we didn't have at at home
how the um stuffed animals
i noticed does he recognize
he we have a larger version of that be winnie the
um he doesn't play with it
he really isn't very into stuffed animals
uhoh
special surprise
yeah
special delivery
um he's not really into stuffed animals all that much
so i kept like trying to find something that he'd be interested in
like we have a dog at home so he's very familiar with the word dog and puppy and all that
and so there was a little chihuahua here
the chihuahua i was trying to um show him to get him interested in but again it's it doesn't you know do anything interesting and he can't really bite it very well i don't think
yeah
that's kind of
and i think you played with the waffles too
did you say
yeah
he doesn't know what they are
but he i think he threw one or somthing i can't remember exactly what he did with it so
hi
you got me
you got me
aw
yes
and then um you have a nick name for him
yeah coop
our last name is cooper and um so i call him coop sometimes
and um we're trying to i try to i actually probably call him coop more often than not but um i intersperse john and coop
where'd your sock go
that's not the baby's
that's not for babies
but you're interested in it
interested in it
oh his sock's all the way on the other side of the room
okay well i think that's all the questions i have
okay
i hope that was useful
it was
yeah
let's put your sock on
where does your sock go on your feet
okay i'm gonna ask you some questions now
okay
about the play session you just had
so what was the first thing that she went to
this
big circle clock
she bit on it
like that
do you think she knows that it's a is it familiar do you have anything like that at home or
we do but it's not foamy
it's it's this color and it has the dials but it's not made out of this
it's wood
oh so but she does have a toy um
it's not a toy but she plays with it
oh it's a real one
it's for their play room so it's for kids but it's not something it's not soft like this one
but it's the exact same colors
so i don't know if she likes the texture of it if she likes the colors i'm not sure
when i pretended it was a hat she threw it off so she i think she knows it's not a hat
we pretended it was a plate and she just really just wanted to bite it
now what did she go to after that
um well i kind of pretended the frog was leaping on her and she kind of she was excited about the frog after he was pretending to kiss her neck
she was laughing a little bit
and then she went straight for the food
which is what she did last time when we were here
she likes the food
specifically the peas
but she didn't find those right away
she played with the plates
so something about circles maybe
and she was playing with mostly playing with the plates at first and then i showed her that these were here and then this was all she really wanted to play with
so i don't know if it's color or the tex
i'm not sure what it is about these but she likes these
she wasn't as interested in the baby this time
in fact she didn't really seem to like the baby this time
um she didn't really interact much with her didn't want to feed her didn't want to hold her hair like she did before
so last time she played with the baby
she did
for quite a bit of time
and she would feed it and do stuff like that
she wasn't interested today
maybe because i pretended she was my baby
maybe
um do you have does she have like one like that at home
not that big but she does have babydolls
okay
and she plays with them sometimes
did she play with the clock a lot last time too
i don't think she played with the clock before at all
was it here
i don't she even noticed it before
and the animals
so does she have you said she really liked the frog
she liked the frog
shh um no she doesn't have a frog at home
she has a lot of stuffed animals but not i don't think she has one that looks like this
she didn't seem interested in the rest of them
she actually fed one of them
she fed the fox her peas
when i asked her if she'll give him some peas
she fed to her
to the fox
she wasn't interested in the donkey at all
i thought the colors would bring her get her attention but she didn't seem interested
and she played with this little bottle
might remind her of her own bottle
does she do a lot of play at home
she has a lot of toys little small toys that she plays with in her pack and
and then her and i will crawl around and play with different stuff
she's got tons of toys
she has three siblings that are like not much older than her
oh
so yeah
so are most of the toys that you have at home things like this that are imitations of real things or
we have play food and we have a a large playroom in our basement and she and we have play food down there and she always goes straight to that
i dunno if she knows if thinks it's real or if she just likes the texture
i'm not sure but it all of course everything's in her mouth at this stage
so i dunno if she thinks it's food or if she just wants to explore
but she really likes the peas
i don't know what it is about those peas
and usually at home she likes noisy toys that make noise
a lot of music type things
we have a microphone toy that she sings in it she just puts it the whole thing in her almost in her mouth
and she talks in it
really loud into it
it's a microphone so
i think she likes to hear herself
and that keeps her occupied
and then any of the toys that have lots of lights and stuff on it she's excited
kennedy
what about the um over there
the the books
you know i didn't really do anything with the books i think they're behind me i didn't even see them over here
but we do have lots of books at home and lots of thick books that she she usually just bites on them
and at story time of course at night we read and she'll have her attention there for a couple seconds but she just not really interested in sitting and hearing the whole book yet
do you have of of those
these specific books
we have one i i think it's this one it might be just really similar
it's got the different things you can touch
and then
no that's it
just similar to this one but not we don't have that
i have doctor seuss books but not this one in particular
and goodnight moon it sounds familiar but i don't think we have it at home
i might have just seen it when i was here
is there anything else you that noticed that was different than the last time or anything she did that surprised you today
um she actually gave the stuffed animals although i only tried a few of them she gave them a little bit more attention this time than she did before
um she's kinda doing the same
she didn't like the doll as much this time
so i don't know why that is
but last time she was trying to put shoes on it and everything
um and she didn't notice the books either maybe just because of where we have it where they are
in relation to where i'm sitting yeah
other than that
she liked the pizza i think she likes the colors
what were some of the things that she liked to play with today
the doll
say the doll and this kangaroo
is it similar to things that she played with last time
uh no you didn't have the doll last time
she was normally playing with the food last time
um or she normally picks up the food like this and things that she knows
um and the little creatures
but she's really playing she played with the doll more or less today
okay
what kinds of things was she doing
is the doll new for her
the doll is new for her
she was pointing to the eyes the nose the mouth
being a little mean to her like michael is to her you know
so i think she thought it was a baby
you could tell she thought it was a little person
um no that's a
oh you found your piggy
good
that's bologna
bad piece of bologna but bologna
and she's more active today than she was last time
okay
yeah
how so just
in terms of asking what things are
you know she's like pointing to what's this picking it up talking more
i think last time she was rather quiet if i'm not mistaken
i wasn't in um with you last time i was
yeah i think she was a little more quieter
um just kinda sorta picking things up thinking that it was food
why isn't this food
you know this is hard
but she knew what they were
say thank you
what are um some of the things that you think she did recognize this time just by
well what's this
say say cookie
she like
mckayla eat your cookie
like she knows
wait where's the juice box
like she knows the cup you're supposed to drink out of it
she'll try to drink out of it
um she thinks that's a cup
yeah so she's trying to suck it you know and it's not working properly
this is peanut
it's not even a cup
um she kinda sorta knows what you're supposed to do with the different things
you want some food
there you go
she tried to feed the bread to the baby
um yeah but she didn't really play with too much more than that
okay
um did she show any interest in any of the animals or where there any that you thought
just the zebra
okay
she knows what a zebra is
all the
well she knows what some of the toys are like the dog
she knows what the toy some of the toys but she doesn't
she has a lot of stuffed animals at home
sometimes she plays with them sometimes she don't
she plays with more blocks and trucks and whatever her brother plays with
computers and
she never ventured that far out the circle
i know i'm talking right
i took mommy's attention didn't i
she's like hey
and those wires are looking mighty tempting
what are you doing
what happened
i dunno
why you breathing hard kayla
kayla
say i don't know
i dunno
um how about books did you guys um
oh
she'll read we read half of the foot book
same that we read last time
does she is so do you have that book at home
i don't have doctor seuss at home i have a lot of the other books
like goodnight moon
i have this one
um she normally goes and picks up a book that she wants read
if she doesn't pick it up she she normally does pay attention but it's gotta be kinda interesting
this one she was more
i don't think she she wanted to kinda smash the book lately
there you go
there you go
you did it all by yourself
i don't want it
that's a that's a
that's a bird
see
no it's not it's a eagle
exactly it's a eagle
here
take 
take him
take him
that's pizza
pizza kayla
see she knows what foods are
say this don't taste like no pizza mommy that's nasty
pizza
um just in reda regards to the foot book i'm sorry
does she know the words that you're the word foot and the plural feet
does she know those
she knows what feet are i dunno if she knows what a foot is
but she knows what feet hands um fingers
if you tell her she'll go
she's telling you i'm gonna do it anyway
um eyes mouth um
no don't eat that
she knows
we do clean the toys
oh you do
i'm not sure
yeah
i'm like they're so dirty
um she knows quite a bit
she knows bottle
cup juice milk
cookie
you want a cookie kayla
fake food
how was she
she knows dance
how was she what
um play with the play with the food
how or how were you both playing it or how does she play with it at home
well when she we she doesn't play with the food at home
that's the whole thing
so to her if you see food you eat it
she doesn't
i would not do that to no child that's just wrong
that's j that's wrong
i just don't under
whatever
they have regular food i don't have food toys at home
okay
well because they eat she eats a variety so she's end up knowing what these different meats are
just because they're normally in her plate
that's probably why she picks them up
they get pizza and bread and
and you tell what the real thing is when you get it so
she's like i wanna eat it
you can't eat it no
nope that's just as fake as the other piece you picked up
yay
okay
so what w what was some things that uh you tried to get her into that were her least favorite
least favorite
see she
say all this fake stuff mommy this is so rude
it's fake kayla
you gotta get this
she know you're lookin at her now
um i don't think she has a least favorite
i dunno she's just exploring i don't know if she's not not liked anything
give me that bottle
is it good
say i don't taste anything
it's juice
so what is the purpose of this one
this study we're actually just trying to get um so see the children's babble over time
as their language are changing and how they're responding to the different toys
so we use the same set of toys over and over again
oh
so we kind of compare um amongst themselves like each child amongst themselves over time
and see how they're developing and if their speech pattern kinda changes
um and then the next visit after this one the two year visit we actually do articulation and speech and language testing
um and we see if like that trend that development has anything to do um the way this child developed and the next child developed and those types of things
oh okay
so we'll have over a hundred fifty kids at the termination of the project
to see so a lot some of the kids um have been coming back with like speech and language difficulties and see if there's anything early on based on the laboratory skills that we're doing in there as well as the babbling that we're seeing in here and the way that they're playing really interacting with the toys
if there's something early on that we can see that points to um a learning
a learning disability
right a learning disability
oh okay that makes sense
no with mckayla she's just um she's much more active today than she was last time
i was wondering what will it take to get to that
see last time she stayed within the circle
it's a whole lot messier now than it was last time
she kinda stayed exactly where you put her last time
yeah a lot of that
okay
you can have the stand
okay
so i think we're actually done
okay
um at talking about what we played with today so i'm gonna stop it
because she's getting really interested in it
as you can see she branched outside of the toys and went to the real stuff and that's what she does at home
alright that was great
i just have a few questions
okay
what um toys did you think that luke liked to play with the most
um anything food related
he loved the pizza wedges the most
does he have similar toys at home
yeah
his actually his brother does and i think he maybe recognized that from before
does he like to play pretend with the foods
um he's just starting to
so he's just starting to get more active on that part
before he wasn't as interested
so i think these last few weeks he's really starting to come around and realize what the food means
yeah utensils and everything
yeah he started to practice with the spoon and he he can feed himself with his fingers
what do you think he likes the least
um it's hard to say he didn't really get too far from this range
um he didn't really seem too interested in the book i read him
only held his attention for a short time
what book did you read him
um we read peekababy
do you like to read at home
yes we do read at home a lot
okay what books do you have at home
um
what's his favorite
quite a few
um we have a lot of the doctor seuss books the little card the little board books a lot
um that i read with his brother too so we usually read as a family
a lot
hey buddy
does he usually play with dolls at home or no
no since they're just the two boys they don't are not really um exposed to dolls as much
we do go to playgroups but i don't think he's noticed so
that's why i thought this time i would see what he would do and he was kind of intrigued for a second but that he wasn't as didn't keep his attention too long
um is there anything that you remember him playing with last time that you thought he had the same interest in
um no i he was all over the keys last time and i don't even know if he s didn't see them because they were by under the books but he he played with new things this time
what else um so he didn't play with any of the same things this time
i think the only thing we did the same was maybe read this book
and i think the toy order might have been a little different
so i dunno if that might have been why
i don't remember how the layout was exactly
do you think he recognizes any of the foods
like does he does he eat any of these foods at home
um no he's not onto solids yet he's still on baby food
but um he does i notice he does want to try to put them in his mouth so i think he's maybe getting that correlation that it is food though
do you think maybe he recognizes food that you eat
oh i'm sure
yeah
we eat a lot of um like pizza and that kind of stuff of his brother
what ya find buddy
a spoon
which of the animals did he seem to like
the only thing he really played with was with the bee word
um we watch the show at home so i know he knows these a lot
um but he didn't really show any interest in any of the other ones
oh and i showed him the frog but he didn't gear towards it i had to prompt it
do you have any animals at home
yeah
uh you mean as far as pets or stuffed animals
either
um we don't have any pets we have tons of stuffed animals so he plays with those a lot at home
which one's his favorite
at home
um probably it's his teddybear that's also his security blanket it's like attached
so he's usually plays with that the most
yeah
you did great
thanks so much for coming in
oh you're welcome
it's kinda fun to play with him by ourselves
we usually have his brother to contend with so
it's a great opportunity then
you got to play by yourself without your brother snapping stuff away from you
um which of these do you think interests her the most
the food and these spoons
and do you think that's similar or different than the last visit
very similar to the last time
i don't remember the first time but last time she definitely stayed with mostly the food
okay was there any food in particular that she really liked
um i'd say the pizza
mostly the pizza and then the spoons which aren't food but the kitchen stuff
okay um which do you think is a good toy for her personality
for her personality oh wow that's a different question
um whats a good toy for your personality
i really don't know what i'd say to that one
it amazes me that she sits in this one spot and doesn't move around to play with all these toys
yeah it doesn't work at home this we i would have to start surrounding her
which toy is good for your personality
i mean it's okay if you don't know
i don't
that's kinda a weird question
um which do you think seemed to interest her the least
the least
everything or the ones i tried out for her
um either
well she seemed to have no interest in this earlier when i tried to play with these
until just now
and the book today which is surprising because she usually joins us when we read at home
because she has two older brothers so we do books
and she's usually right in the middle of them either turning them or listening
so i was surprised when i pulled out these two that she has no interest
now you're gonna go go ahead
does she play with similar toys at home
um not to the food
we don't have any food at home
um that's not true once in a while she plays with the fake apples we have but it's not usually in the toy area
um books usually
um once in a while a baby doll
a little bit smaller baby doll
that's like her size
um so yeah i think we need to go get food because it does seem to always interest her here
um what does she generally like to do with dolls at home
she doesn't often play with her dolls she'll just kinda hold it a little bit but then it's not one of her favorites
um she typically plays with more the musical interactions toys or vehicles with her brothers
actually that's like a typical one playing with cars versus a doll
um do you think she recognized any of the names of these objects
um when i said the drink and she put that to her mouth
made me think she was i was surprised that she did that
um i mean she does have cups and bottles at home but it surprised me that she put that right to her mouth
other than that i don't think she really knows the names of the other ones
okay would she be familiar with any of the stuffed animals like winnie the pooh or the
no
not by like name or
um is there anything else that you
um that she doesn't usually sit this still with a group of toys around her
i want her to do this at home when i need her too
um when i wanna work sit and play
um no i don't think so
other than she must love this food and i have to go by new toys
no she likes the food you like that
um so what kind of toys do you think that she was interested in
uh she went right for the food
which is what she did the last couple times too
do you think there's a reason for that
i don't know we don't have fake food at home
but when we went to our friends house she saw it and went right for that too
so i don't know if she just likes food
or i don't know maybe cause of the bright colors
um so you don't have food at home
do you have any other types of toys at home
uh we have lots of books
and we have um we don't have a lot of stuffed animals
we have a lot of um plastic toys
like she has a piano and she has bongos
and um those wire balls
i don't know what the word is
that's in the lobby where like you put the balls on the wire
that kind of stuff
that yummy
um you said that she liked she went for the food last time too
do you recognize any changes or anything like that at all since last time
or was it pretty much the same thing
she went directly for the pizza
both times
um
i think she's this time she's playing with more
like she didn't touch the ice last time
she didn't touch the can the last time
so now she's kind of exploring a little more
um i heard you um making sheep sounds
i don't do that very well
that's fine
do you think she recognizes any of the sounds the animals make
we think she recognizes the duck
um and we're not sure why that one out of the others
but we said one day you know the duck says quack quack
and i'm pretty sure she tried to imitate me
um we're not quite sure that we can say it's her first word
but it was two syllables
and she said it immediately after we said quack quack
and every now and then she'll do it again when we say quack quack
she'll say whack whack
or however she says it but she doesn't do it with any of the other animal sounds
just the duck
does she have like a favorite toy at home she plays with a lot
she does tend to switch it up a lot
um
right now the thing that she plays with the most consistently is we have the farm refrigerator magnets
um
so she likes to pull them off the fridge but she also like to push the barn door because it makes all the animals sounds
um
i'd say that's the only thing that she plays with every single day
other than that she kinda switches it up
some days she wants to play with the musical instruments
some days she wants to play with the books
some days she wants to play with um we have a play matt on the floor
but it's seasame street characters
so she pulls their faces out and pulls the eye balls out
takes that apart
yup yah
the only she plays with is the farm every single day
um
and do you have any of these books at home or does she have a favorite book at home
um
do you read to her a lot
right now she really likes good night gorilla
and i really can't tell you why
but she just she thinks it's funny maybe it's the way we read it
um and she goes down for a nap every day with a touch and feel animals book
um so she'll sit in her crib and she'll have that and fall asleep with that book
um but we have a couple different touch and feel ones so we switch it up every day
um
and she likes i mean she loves elmo she recognizes elmo
so if elmo's on anything she likes it
so we have a couple different elmo books too
so now you said good night gorilla is that similar too
i think it's the same author but it's the gorilla
he lets all the animals out of the cages at night
and then they all go to sleep and then they all have to go back to their cages
on every page there's a little mouse
so when we read it we always kinda huh there's the mouse
i think that's what she likes more than the story
there's really not much of a story to it
you see the duck
can you say quack quack
you're not very talkative today
um and does she have any sibling at home
no
no cats or anything
we have a dog
okay
is it a small or dog or big dog
yah she loves the dog more than anything
that's good
um
have you gotten her to i mean i know she's really young play with any utensils or anything
has she started to use anything like that
she takes the spoons
um sometimes if she's having a fussy day we'll let her hold a spoon while she's eating
so that she has her own thing
um
at restaurants she'll try and grab the first stuff she sees on the table
but i mean spoon
she doesn't have the motor skills
where you going
so what was he most interested in
standing up
the peas of course
every time the peas have been his favorite
it's the food that he recognizes the most
he eats peas he likes peas a lot
but i think they're also very chewy
the texture to chew and such
the waffles
he likes the waffles
and we had ice cream cones the other day so he was carrying that around
not for very long though
was he interested in any other of the foods
uh he looked at the pizza and the spaghetti
that's about it today
oh and this can thing
what is that
what have you got
did you show
he just likes the way he can hold it and drop it
that one he doesn't really chew it
he just holds it and drops it
makes a good noise i think the
did you show him any of the animals
i did
i showed him the bee and the sheep and the kangaroo
but mostly he just liked that this had eyes that he could bite
i was tellin him that his sister and brother used to his sister and brother used to like
we don't have to be at home right now so he doesn't know what they are
but they do
so what was the what was the game you were playing with him with the
uhoh peas on the head
well first it was all fall down he likes to drop things
and so like before we were we um
like he likes to do it in the bathtub and stuff like that
like he just picks something up and drops it
over something or around something
and so we're just calling it all fall down
and then he started falling down
and then i was putting peas on our heads and they were falling down
and peas in the mouth and it fell down too
was there anything he was interested last time that he didn't go for this time
he did more of the food last time
this time he was more happy standing up
and he usually goes goes and pulls her hair for a little bit but he didn't do that this time
oh here's the ice cream cone
that's the only thing baby dolls are good for for him
you can pull their hair without them getting mad at you huh
he likes to pull hair
and bite
so have you guys do you guys have a lot of these toys at home or
um we have some spoons and plates and not really many food toys like that
so we have the bottle
um lots of stuffed animals but
he doesn't play with those as much lots of little stuff animals
my daughter plays with those more than him
and we have a babydoll like that
we have a couple babydolls for my daughter but
um we have yeah several of the books like that ones
does he like it when you read to him
he usually we usually do one book for him and the rest he just sits through his siblings' books
he just listens to their books too
what kinda books do you read to him
oh he likes the touch and feel ones a lot
and ones with baby pictures
yeah
and we have some little ones that are little tiny ones that he likes to carry around
um
but he mostly listens pretty well to theirs actually
just he's got the lap and he likes to keep his his throne
are you a good listener
yeah
it's good to be a good listener
okay
well we are done with this part
thank you so mu
you're welcome
um
i have some questions for you
sure
just leave that on
oh okay
um i noticed that she was really interested in the doll
does she have dolls at home
she does
she does
she likes her dolls a lot
yeah
does she take her to
what's that
does she take her a the dolls
or not really
toys
she gets a little attached
she's a little shy
aw
um
she
oh gosh
lemme think i dunno
do you think she recognizes like is the doll her own size or like a possible playmate
i don't think so yet
okay
she has dolls of different sizes
she has one that's that big
she has one that two that are maybe like two thirds of that size
and she has one that's really little
and she seems to do the same things with all of them
what does she do
um she likes to feed them and carry them around
and she likes to
um sometimes she likes to change their clothes
not very not too often yet
okay what does she call them
so
she doesn't have any names for them yet so
okay
but um my son has named some of our dolls
so she may end up calling them whatever he has named them
okay
so i don't she hasn't named them yet
um she might have called one of them baby
okay
but that's it's only happened maybe once
so um
she also calls her cat baby so
oh
but we also call him baby so
she is calling him what we call him so
um she has a couple of stuffed animals that she likes
okay i noticed she noticed this one
she knows that guy
she has some bear's that she likes so he probably looks kinda like a bear
oh okay
has a bear
bear
and a purple dog
so there's a couple but she definitely gravitates more to her dolls
okay
than her than the stuffed animals
at home
what stuffed animals here do you um think she might recognize or that she has at home
see
we have
we have a zebra
that looks similar
okay
and
actually not too many of the other ones
okay i remember in one of the um one of the books you were reading
ya know
the one with like the touch
this one
does she recognize these animals
i think so
i think so
which ones
um
she probably recognizes the duck
the duck
and the horse
mkay
actually no she cause i think she says duck sometimes
okay
um so i know she recognized duck
and she i think she recognizes a horse
um just cause when we were doing the when she was doing the puzzle in the other room
she was doing the farm animals
and i'd say where's the horse
and she'd get the horse
well okay
so and she knows cows
pigs
not sure
that is interesting like she knew where directly to touch
she loves touch books
anything that's a touch book she is she's a happy girl
um
touch books and flap books and
we didn't those she probably would've like the the peekaboo one too
but she usually likes those so
um do you have those other books at home
we have these two
we don't have this one but we have the regular goodnight moon
okay
so she's seen the the kitty the kitties before
she likes kitties a lot
so anything that has a cat on it she just loves so
aw
so it's like any book that has a cat in it she's she's happy so
aw that's adorable
you poor girl
she's bored
we're almost done i promise
um
with that one book with the doctor seuss book
uh
the foot or the
yeah the one you were reading to her um
um you think she recognizes like body parts yet
she does
oh yeah she
yeah she was funny i said the foot and she's like my feet
and um but she has a we have a f body part book at one of those books
the karen cats books
that's a body part book
and she knows
she'll say cheek and she'll point to her elbow
she'll point to her back
aw
um so she knows a lot of her body parts
um which surprised me
i haven't i don't remember my
i have an older kid but i don't remember when he learned
different things so
but it was funny all of a sudden she started
doing her her body parts
and she'd say the word too so
that's great um
so um
yeah i noticed she's like um
with with like dolls
like the dolls she knew like what utensils to use
and what things what here do you think she recognizes or
probably every probably everything
all the food she probably recognizes
this we don't have
we have she's seen all the food either either both in real and play form
this was the only one we don't have as a play form but she's had lunch meat so
okay
um
but she probably
she loves peas
so that was one of em
the frozen ones
i know i was like frozen peas
we alright
so
um the desserts
i know she picked up this one
she picked up the ice cream
she
um
we just had ice cream the other night actually
that might be why she went for that
okay
so she likes to feed the babies bottles
she never took a bottle herself
she never had one
that's interesting
she she she nursed and then she went straight to sippy cups
um like that kind
like the hard kind not the kind like where the
they have like the soft ones that are supposed to mimic bottles
and she didn't want anything to do with it so
so but the babies get the bottle
this so
yeah
yeah i noticed she was like shh she knew what to use for what
like the bottle to drink out of this to eat out of
um does she have like her own size at home
we do
we do
she has perfectly about that size
the uh size of like the table
what would uh be the table spoon
yeah
probably um
eh she got the plate
she helps set the table at supper
aw
we have all the the plastic um
plates and bowls
in one of our lower drawers
and she we say it's time to eat it's time for supper
and she'll go the drawer and get out the plate and put it up on the table
and she gets the bowls and
she's a good helper
ha
aw
she likes to try ta
to help so
aw i'm sure she recognizes this
yeah
we eat pizza a lot
we eat like pizza a lot so
she likes pizza
we probably eat it more than we used to cause she likes it a lot so
oh
we probably have it once a week so
um
how about other sandwiches
sandwiches
ya know she uh
w the only sandwich we eat
she eats um
probably is peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
but i don't think she sees me make them very often
okay
she probably she might recognize that container from home
as seeing it on the counter or in the cupboard
but has never actually seen me make them
cause usually i'm making them really quick and usually there are like we have them for lunch today
cause i put them in the car to go
cause i picked up my son from school and then we drove over here
so we weren't going to stop for lunch
on the way so everybody had peanut butter and jelly sandwiches so
um
so she's had
since most of the time we don't
she and my s
both my kids
don't have sandwiches just because they pull them apart
so a lot of times with sandwiches and salads at our house for the two kids i give them
the same components
i just don't put them together
so i guess like a sandwich i'll give them bread and cheese and meat
i just put them in three separate piles on the plate
because if i put it all together they just rip it apart anyway so
so they wanna see what each thing is
i was like alright
here's your meat cheese and bread
and they eat it
so i'm like alright
when you get to be older you can put your sandwich together and realize it's pretty good that way
but
and then i realized they would eat salads that way too
we would try to mix up a salad and they didn't want it
but if i put the lettuce the tomato
ya know whatever the elements were
separately
they would eat them
i was like wonderful
that's interesting
i was like if you eat it i'll do it
it's not any extra effort
so you know it's just the same
yeah i know she picked that one up
the
waffle do you like waffles yes
yup they like waffles
she eats a lot of cereal
she likes cheerios a lot
and small cereals
so
she likes

then
do you remember
past few sessions
the food
and th more so on the dolls last time i believe
any particular items of the food
no
ch i think
were you did you like the peas last time
no
ye
and it's just kinda like today just picking up everything
okay
she likes the pretend food
uh what about what items that she didn't seem to care for or wasn't interested in all in
she doesn't seem to play with the books so much while she's here
but everything else she goes for
careful
there's a cord there
what kind of toys does she play with at home
we've got tea sets
um she carries around a lot of baby dolls
or stuffed animals she's got a
she just got a dinosaur soft dinosaur that she loves
um strol they she and her sister play with strollers
with their baby dolls and they take care of their baby dolls
um pretty much anything that's out
so
and then today if you had to pick a few items that you would say she seemed
she loved the plates
she wanted to play with the plates
and the baby doll
and then the teapot
do you think she recognizes the names to any of these
oh ye
this is we were at the pool yesterday and this is what she did with a pool toys

ah
what items do you think she knows the names of
or understands
ah oop
she knows cookie

um ice cream
and baby doll
do you have any of these same toys at home

then bring a book ba another book back for me or
do you have any of these
yes

plates
plates
ye
oh
okay well i think that's all we have for you
keepin the beat
okay you guys did a great job
just have a few questions for you
okay
um what did you guys play with first
he went right for the food
do you have pretend food at home
just a little bit
not a lot
what does he recognize here
he knows bread cheese the drinks the bottle waffle
okay
he might recognize pizza
i don't i'm not sure
what did you play with that he doesn't recognize or that he hasn't had before
spaghetti
okay
and peanut butter
okay how this has he had that before
not that i know of
not when he's with me
still shown interest in some of these
makes me wonder what the grandparent's are up to
but uh yeah
what else
what else has he not had that he picked up like that
uh he's never played with a baby like this before
okay
so i was actually quite surprised how much he took to that
what was he doing with the baby
feedin or giving it the bottle
okay
and then patting it and hugging it
its interesting he's really comfortable with his utensils
um which ones does he know
he knows everything but a knife
spoon fork
okay
um how the animals
what was he interested in
well he doesn't these animals he doesn't know a lot
kind of different animals
but he knows chicken dog and um donkey and frog
okay um what else did you guys play with
oh
uh mainly this
he was not very interested in the book and usually he is so i think he was surprised
do you have any of these books at home
uh some
okay
i have several like this one the touch and feel and then i have several versions of good night moon and some doctor seuss books
um you read the on the farm book
um what are the which of the animals does he recognize
um well the the only ones i got to that he really talked about were the duck and the sheep
okay um back to the food
um okay there were a few other items that he played with
which were they
um what else did he pick up
the peas
has he had those before
yeah
okay
yep not interested
but yes
okay
do you think he'll be having this anytime soon
uh no
he's had a popsicle
like the fruit kind but not this kind of thing
okay
like i said that i'm aware of
he did he surprised me that was like the first thing he went for was this and put it right in his mouth like he knew what to do with it and i was like what okay
but then his big brother does have it actually
see he hasn't directly but his big brother
so maybe that's maybe he's mimicking
thank you
thank you
i was i didn't actually pay that close attention to what exactly he was
i guess that's everything
okay
oh cookie
okay
now that he has had
okay alrighty
okay sweetie nothings gonna come out ah
like you really drank something
good job
oh just so funny
alrightie well thank you
all right
some other questions
sure
um what kind of toys does she go for first
uh she came in for the food as well
which items
spaghetti and peas i think
um what about other items you know that she recognizes besides the food
oh she n um let's see
the drink
the hamburger
waffle
bread
and the items that she doesn't have at home or has never had but you know she went for it
well we don't really have a lot of play food
okay
we just play pretend
we we have like plates and things but and little cups but not um
so really any of that
but the food items she's not familiar with
oh
is there any that she played with
well she picked up the peanut
and the ice
but kinda tossed it
um i think she had this in her hand too
but didn't really know what that i'm not really sure what that is
she liked the bee
and the goose
i guess that's a goose
and winnie the
were there any other of the stuffed animals
uh she did like this the frog
but i tried to show her these and she wasn't that interested
i see you whoops
i'm sorry
which one did you try to show her
the dog and the donkey
with shoes
and what about over here in this section
uh she likes the books
she likes this
right
every kinda book that's like this
and then she likes this one
which of the animals in the on the farm book does she know or doesn't know
um i think the only one she does not know is the pig
that doesn't seem to stick for some reason
but she does seem to know the rest of 
and she knows all of the
yeah she knows the cow
and the yeah
and let me see what else i saw she was playing with
oh that book
and was um was she doin anything with this or
no she's sensitive
so that large size she has a small scale baby that
and the bottle and stuff
she plays all that at home
but i think this was she kinda was like that's okay
no no no sweetie that's trash
yucky
oh you see that pink ball back there
can't reach that right now
come sayla
okay
and were there any items that we haven't talked about
look sayla
sayla
that maybe she's played with
i think she played with
cheese
i didn't say that yeah
and she played with these spoons
um she picked these up too
oh yeah
did she play with the
the keys
and utensils too
which ones does she know
spoon and fork
do you guys play that game at home
that she was reading about
oh yeah
yeah
it's the only way we can get her to pose for pictures
is for her to play peekaboo and then we'll get a picture of her
sayla you say peekaboo
where's sayla
you like her hair
she has a fascination with curly hair
she loves it
everybody in my family has it
so she just really loves it
it's nice
she's such a girl
all right that's it
thank you
you're welcome thank you
look hettie there are two peas
so what do you think she liked to play with most today
the baby
the baby
the baby
and the peas
she really likes though doesn't she
yeah
so i noticed she didn't really play with the books
so she prefers the toys
well at home she loves books more than anything but i think these are just different toys from what she's used to
and um and different books as well and so she just was more excited by the toys
what foods does she recognize
um probably the peas
yeah
and the pizza
um i mean this this isn't we don't eat a lot of these foods at home so i think that they're they're not super familiar to her
for the most part
but the peas she definitely has down
um i know you picked this up
does she she knows what this is
maybe
i dunno
i mean shh she she mostly for cookies she has like animal crackers
okay
so so i dunno
i dunno if she would know that that's a cookie
so you don't have pretend food at home
no we don't
and she loves it so maybe i need to get some
yeah
i know this is really pretty
does she like this one
yes that's the baby
she also played with these a lot too
yes
and she has her own set of keys
that have like a sound effect button
i actually think she got it from doing a study here
and um so so she knows what keys are
has she had this before
she's never had an ice cone
that i know of
in fact just the other day my gramma gave her a bite of ice and she spat it out
i know i was like i need to learn how to how to how to do that myself
how this i know it looks kinda funny
yeah
we i don't think she she's had spaghetti for sure but i don't think she would connect that that's spaghetti
at all
what
you wanna read the book to the baby
well she knows her animal sounds down pact that's for sure
yes she does
animals
so which animals does she know
she knew all of these
she called the horse a cow
but i dunno why she knows horses really well
she liked the doll
yeah she loves the doll
well she has a brand new baby brother so baby's are kind of a big deal at our house right now
huh
we spend a lot of time taking care of tiny babies
what
does she have dolls at home too
she has more stuffed animals
she has a little doll or two but um but she's not that interested in them at home
do you have pets at home or no
we have two little dogs
yeah
and you played with this one as well
yes she has a stuffed frog that she likes
she knows she knows most of her animals really well
which ones here
she knows she she would think that's a penguin is my guess
um but she knows donkey zebra dog frog birdy bee for sure
where's the bee hettie
do you see the funny bee
what's that
is this it
crazy hair
buzz
um yeah i no i noticed she she knew a lot of the sounds that the animals make
crazy bee
um you also went over some like when you were playing with the doll you were going over the body parts
yes
it's amazing that she like recognizes that
yeah she knows a lot of body parts
some that surprise me like elbow or shoulder she knows right where they are
huh hettie
hettie where's your elbow
where's your elbow
yes
um how utensils
she knows spoon
she might know plate
i bet she knows plate
she still prefers to eat with her hands
well no she likes to pick up the food with her hands and put it on the spoon and then put the food the spoon near her face and then she'll take it off and put it in her mouth with her hands
but yeah she she would know what a spoon is
oh don't put it in your mouth
do you think she recognizes the um juice in the bottles
or what's in the bottles
i mean she probably thinks it's milk because she drinks either milk or water most of the time
she gets juice every once in a while and she certainly knows the word juice but i don't think she would recognize that as juice
usually juice for her is apple juice any way so
orange i dunno if she'd know
keys
okay well thank you so much for coming
it was great watching you
and meeting you hettie
say thank you
she's very bright
we think so
okay well as joanna plays a little bit i'm just gonna ask a couple questions
you can still play
what type of toys or what toys did she go to first
she always goes for the plastic ones
oh okay
which ones um does she like best or do you think that she recognizes
just the food
okay
which food items do you think maybe she recognizes the things that she played with or like would she recognize that or
well the first things that she picked up were the sippy cup and the bottle
so i'm thinking she's thirsty
oh okay
and she recognized ice and the pizza definitely
other than that i think it was just toys but
and she was playing with the um what's it called
oh the pitcher
yeah
yeah she was playing with that
dumping she was dumping the bottle and the sippy cup into the pitcher
and you were trying to put together um
the sandwich
does she would she recognize what that is or
she usually has peanut so i'm not sure that she would recognize the
sandwich
yeah
but she does know bread
okay
what of the stuffed animals do you think that she would recognize or notice
the name or something
i was lookin through to see if there was something we could play with and i mean she might recognize a dog but i dunno
and we have a pooh about that size but she doesn't
yeah
and the book um that you were reading to her
yeah
was she um would she recognize any of those animals that's in the book
yeah she clearly recognized the duck and the cow
i dunno about the others

not necessarily to associate
oink

um i noticed you mentioning certain foods that you can't feed to the baby
um
oh
she was trying to feed it to the doll

um i dunno
i think i sa i told her she eats pizza but the baby doesn't eat pizza
okay
and the waffles
like the bigger foods

i don't think she played with she didn't play with any of the dessert ones
um and you made a sandwich right there
yes
um do you think she would she recognizes what's in the sandwich or the components of the sandwich
i don't know if she knows the components of the sandwich she knows what cheese is
she eats a lot of cheese so she definitely knows
she actually tried to eat this
when i gave it i said cheese and she she bit this
you know wash that one
for sure
yeah we clean them all it's okay
so that one she definitely knew
okay
how things to drink out of
um she grabbed that this cup
i think this looks like hers
like a sippy cup
okay
so she started to give that to the baby too because she drinks out of something like that
uh do you think she recognizes what's in the cup
um as a a liquid yeah
i dunno if she knows per that it's juice exact
she doesn't even um really drink juice herself so
okay
um
uh you played with this
yeah we played i just showed it to her the clock
um she likes a song called like tick so that's why i was like showing it to her
she dances to that
aw

i gotta get you a bottle after this huh
back to the peekaboo book um
oops i just lost it
did she recognize what this object was
she knows what a ball is
i don't know if she knew this is a ball but she if you show her a ball um she knows what a ball she knows what a hat is
okay
yeah she definitely calls those out when she sees them
okay
okay how this umbrella
she didn't know umbrella but she knew flower
okay good
she knows umbrella though too
like if she actuall if you brought in an umbrella she would know an umbrella
okay
just from being at the beach
okay
um there's one other item that you didn't mention
i dunno if i can find it
here we go
this one
oh the cookie
that's what the baby doesn't eat
the cookie
oh yeah
she eats lots of cookies
yes
that was the other item that the
yeah erin loves cookies
thank you
yum
alrighty
well done
great
well that was easy
thank you
no thank you for fitting us in
and mommy
um i just have a few questions for you
um so what toys do you think he was interested in the most
um the little things
um there's another one that i can't find
oh here
um the spoon
the plates
and the pitcher
and the book
the peekaboo book
yeah
how does that taste
yeah everything gets sprayed down that doesn't taste very good
yeah
yeah
um were there any toys that he did not like
um i don't know
i didn't really notice it i mean he
i mean he didn't he didn't he didn't pick up some like he didn't go to this to this area over here of stuffed animals and he didn't pick up the car but
he has stuffed animals he plays with at home so
i don't you know i'm not sure if it was not liking it or just getting distracted by other toys
um does he have any of these items like the spoon
he'll have spoons he doesn't have any um he does have food
he does have like um um apples and carrots and pears and eggs and you know
food to play with and spoons to play with and and um pictures to play with
um and books to play with and baby dolls and yeah he has he has pretty much the the same array but you know there isn't a like a match of like oh that's the exact same thing
does he play a lot with the dolls
try holding her
does he try to feed it
um he um he hasn't really started to do much with the doll except take it and run with it
that might have something to do with it being his older sisters
they sort of have a collection they share and um at any one time you know it's determined that it's the favorite doll and and then that's the one they both want
but possession seems to be more important than actually doing anything with the doll
okay
um i know you picked this up do you think he recognizes this
i don't know he does eat eat cheese
pretend
how do you think he might recognize this and
he he might recognize
yeah he might recognize the bread
um
he's seen he's only seen an ice cone probably about four times but
he really likes it when he sees it
oh jeez
how these
um i don't know if if he recognized these as as something to eat or not
does he had them before
pardon
has he eaten them before
yeah he's eaten peas before
how the animals there was one animal book i think
um oh yeah this one yeah
we went we got to the second page and then he got
does he recognize the two animals
this one
um i i mean i think so
he doesn't he can't call them by name
but but we do a lot of animal stuff
thank you
you like that sound
i do too
um
do you see the duck
bless you
bless you
you wanna touch the duck
you wanna touch the duck
you need a tissue
how 
he went for the books over the the toys
um
did you get your hands wet
think of what he does at home
um he has you know books and toys readily available on a shelf
um he gravitates at home towards toys that um come apart
oh
yeah
like um there's um you know the the pegs in the little holes and then you hammer down
well he can't hammer down but he can stick in the holes and then take them out
and there's the like a ball that's made out of magnetic parts that he can unhook
um so he tends to go for those first
things that things that either either he can make noise with
um or stack or take apart
um and then he'll then he'll go then he'll go for the books at home
alright well you guys did a great job
alright
thanks for comin in
thanks for comin in vincent
oh one other thing
um did he recognize any of these like utensils
or like i know you mentioned this one
um yeah
i think he recognized the spoon
okay
and i think he recognized
whoops
are you okay
i think he recognized this
you know what that was just a little bit of a surprise
aw it's okay
but i don't think we lost any body parts
i don't think so
are you okay
aw
are you tired
aw
now we're getting into nap time
how things to drink out of
yeah he definitely recognized that
he drank out of it like
he tried to get me to drink out of it so
does he recognize the juice maybe
um i think so
inside
alright
thanks so much for comin in
alright
sure
okay now you have to give that back
um thanks vincent you did a great job
you have to give that back
okay alrighty you guys did a great job
yeah they're washed that's why i said don't worry
so what did you all play with first
she played with the um the doll and the food
she has lots of dolls at home
we don't have any of the fake food yet
okay
um what food did she pick up that she was interested in
um like the bottle and um the s the i think the bottle the food the the spoon and the plate
she now that she's trying to feed herself
okay
um what food items in particular
what did you pick up
she picked up the peas um the pizza and the cookie
for the most part
oh and the spaghetti
okay
um
the juice uh yeah
one other food item that
oh the cheese
that's right
um what about animals
what stuffed animals did you try to get her to play with
the zebra um she came over with the frog and the bee and the chicken rooster whatever but she didn't really play much with it
do you have any pets at home
we have a cat
did she recognize other pets
yeah um you mean here
yeah here
um yeah i was gonna say that and the dogs
um if we go out she's not afraid of animals
and she d you know she'll call the you know she'll call other animals jazzie which is what the cat is called
um okay she played with this
does she have a similar toy at home
um nothing that i can think of
okay
um has she started um learning numbers
not uh she'll repeat after you you know but she can't i mean she doesn't quite say but if you count if you're going up and down the stairs then she'll make you know up the little inflections in her voice so that it's the same number of syllables or whatever that you're that you're saying
so she'll pretend to count with you
or she has um she has you know like a bunch of kids songs and one of them's like a s you know all on the alphabet and another one's all songs with numbers and she'll sort of pretend to sing along with them
okay um you mentioned she has a lot of dolls at home
um i know you tried to like point out the dolls items of clothing
does she recognize any of what these things are
yeah like her dolls at home she'll take the shoes off and try or if she finds a pair of shoes she'll try and put them on her dolls so i think she gets what shoes are for
okay and then you tried to read to her a little bit
not interested today
you did start to read the on the book
what animals in there did she recognize
um she'll i mean the only thing she did was i got as far as the little chicks and she went to give a kiss but that was it
and then she went back to what she was doing
she didn't take much interest in the books today
um there was one animal though i remember
um that one
the sheep
i'm not sure i mean i don't know if she recognized or just because i was petting the fur just did what i did
okay
alrighty well thank you
thank you
okay i was gonna ask if it's okay if i start asking you questions
oh yeah
he's so in tuned to me
everytime i shifted he was like
yes he's very even when we were sitting in the waiting room like he heard the door open down the hallway and looked towards it like he knew someone was coming in
oh that's funny
always listening
um so let's talk about the different things he played with today
um do you wanna run me through the session a little bit
sure
um he has always been very very interested in the food
the food has always been the first item he goes to
and he's always been least interested in stuffed animals
i don't know why
if it's even at home he has stuffed animals and it is the least interesting thing to him
uh he loves books
and so but he's in some sort of phase uh and it showed here too where he picks just a couple of books
and wants to read through or look through the same books over and over again as opposed to continuing to go through the books even though there's more there
but at least he'll sit still for them
which is good
um yeah he a little bit into the baby and what the baby could do
you know he pretended to drink himself and then let the baby drink a little
so that was good
and we don't have any baby dolls at home
so uh i dunno i guess he just knows from himself what
what to do with it
yeah
okay
so
yeah i thought it was uh pretty good
he talks a lot more at home
like he was talking a little bit here but really quietly and kinda shyly i think just it's new
new surrounding
but that's one thing at home yeah at home he talks a lot more
yeah i can totally imagine
yeah
we probably get a lot of that
yeah
so
um well let's talk about uh what you thought was um his favorite thing here today
um i think the favorite thing is the spoons
the plasticware
things that he can collect
well too but i think i mean overall still the plastic food is probably his favorite thing here
in terms of last time the types of food he was playing with and this time um do you think he recognized more of the items either look or name
i think he does
uh at eleven months old i mean he'd never had a slice of pizza he'd never i don't think he'd even had ice or anything like that
so he probably recognizes all the food here now whereas before i don't even i mean i think he recognized it before but he was more just interested in gnawing on it and putting it in his mouth so
i think he does uh recognize the food more
was he more interested in like the bottle than the cup he's transitioning in like age you think
i dunno i mean yeah he kinda just fed the bottle the baby and put it down and he is holding on to the cups so yeah that's possible for him that he is more into the cup for being a little bit older
did babies use the bottle
were there any other foods that uh you introduced to him
like what they were
uh you mean that i introduced to him in here or at home or
well they're to they're not literally what they look like
yeah
i mean i think i think he understands that it's all fake
like i think he
i mean he will at home he'll pretend to eat something
he'll do like
so i think he realizes that all this is fake food
and that he just recognizes it for kinda what it should be
okay
but and i do think he does uh know what it looks like
but
okay so he didn't have any trouble for example recognizing that the pasta was spaghetti or like that you were like this is that
yeah i don't think so
i think
i do i don we didn't really go over the spaghetti i'm not sure if he would recognize this as spaghetti
but like the ice cone i know he definitely recognized
the pizza slices
um the spoons the cups
course those are probably real spoons but
uh the bread the waffles
i think he recognizes those for the types of food that they are
oops
are you feeding yourself
what are you eating
eating some
and have you introduced the idea of a clock at home or
not i me he uh he is very obsessed with our watches
uh and he will sometimes insist that we take them off so that he can hold them and look at them and investigate them
but we haven't i don't even well we may have one clock like this but most of what we have is digital clocks and he we haven't really gone over digital clocks at home
so
okay
yeah
um one thing he picked up this time was he picked up the keys and looked straight towards the door and was like that you know keys go with the door
so he's definitely making more connections uh as far as what different items do as well
thank you
um were there any other foods that he might be familiar with that you showed him or unfamiliar with that you
um the peanut
he definitely knows what peanut is
and likes peanut
the peas
i we ne i don't think i think he mainly showed me foods that he eats at home or that he recognizes
i don't think he went too much for the different foods that he didn't recognize really like these things that are in boxes that are
i don't think anyone would know what they were unless they could read
so
and he didn't seem to he did seem to go for the foods that he recognized versus things that he didn't wouldn't know
so
and i think actually in turn i went with the foods that i knew he would recognize i don't think i really picked up things that i didn't think he would recognize
uh i don't i didn't do it consciously i just
well yeah
just picked up things that i thought he would be familiar with
so for example um like he's picking up the like round do you think he thinks they're more like blocks or peanut and soup or
it's hard to say
i think yeah i think he recognizes things like this
i think he knows he can't eat them he's not sure quite what to do with them so he's just kind of ignores them
so um
and then you introduce them with their names
yeah
but he didn't you know he just didn't seem to latch on to them
but like i told him this was peanut and he was just kinda like
right
it's not i think and again i think it's he realizes that it's fake and that he is not actually gonna get peanut out of here so
uh so i think that he
and he can't chew on it
so
things like spoons or bottles that he can chew on even though he knows that he's not getting anything
thank you
pretending
that's right
uh what about the animals that he did play with
did he um does he were there ones that he liked more or ones that you felt were more familiar to him
um i think most of the animals that we were looking at that he liked the best were ones that we read about in books
because we've we read a lot of books and we have like like this book we have a lot of the touch and feel type books and one of them has a zebra in it and so i think he was most attracted to the
hi
the animals that he recognizes from his books
we don't have most of these stuffed animals at home
um
which ones are the ones that um he played with today
uh he played with the zebra a little bit
and the seal or he at least identified them
and we looked at the frog and the goose
uh and then after that he kind of lost interest so
but yeah i think and those are again all they're all all ones that we have in books so
which books do you
if you don't mind telling me
which books have them the
um we have one
which one has the zebra in it
we have a couple that um
one is like at the
and that's the one that has the zebra in it
um and we have one that is sea creatures
that has uh seals in it
and the goose i'm try i dunno if we actually have a goose one or if we've seen geese actual geese walking around so that might be why he knows
that's cool
geese
and then we have um we have a book that's called touch and that has a frog in it and then the little frog has it's touch and feel it's the one with sticky fingers on it
ew
i know
yeah
ooh
does the frog you know have sticky fingers
yeah
that's funny
so
okay and then um saving
oh the baby
you were talking he played with the baby
a little bit
yeah
what how were you playing with the baby today
um oh i was just ask he picked up the cup and started pretending to drink out of it and i was just asking him you know oh well who else who else would want a drink and or who would want a drink from a sippy cup and he didn't offer it to me he offered it to the baby so that was
okay
yeah uh and he seemed to pretend to kind of feed the baby
and then tow kind of towards the end we were getting to maybe trying to put the baby's shoes on but he didn't uh didn't jump right on that
but we i mean he knows for himself he knows his different articles of clothing he knows his shoes and his shirt and that type of thing so
uh i was thinking maybe he would go for trying to kind of dress the baby a little bit but he didn't exactly show interest in it
we might have gotten there
but i think and i honestly think the reason he didn't wanna do it was more because he was he didn't have the hands to do it because he's made this little collection here that he's holding on to no matter what else he does
yeah he's been doing he did that in the uh waiting room too
it i i don't know if it's just a phase he's going through or that all kids go through
i think i've i've heard some kids are like collectors
and they you know we he does a little music class and they'll bring out like little shaker eggs or something and he'll be the kid he wants to you know pick up as many as he can hold
flip the pages
that's funny
so yeah he is a bit of a collector so i think that's also why he likes these things he can get a bunch in his hands all at the same time
so
so he really likes books
he really likes books
he has a huge bookcase full of books and almost every single day we empty it out going going through all the books
so
are these um new books
the ones uh here
yeah we haven't all of these i think are ones we haven't read but we've read similar ones to it
like we we have a karen katz book but it's not it's not this one
like he's read where is
but he hasn't read the peekaboo baby um
we actually have goodnight moon but not the counting book
oh okay
so i think it was different but familiar in that way
we have a we have a touch and feel book but it's not it's not this one
and we have several touch and feel books
and we have some doctor seuss books and that type of thing
so just similar
what was familiar the same with the goodnight moon book
um you know mainly the pictures
because after the first after the first couple of pages um the the numbers that they're using for things are not the same as what they are in the book
like in the book there's only a pair of mittens and here there's eight mittens
and you know
but no but i but he recognizes the pictures they're all directly drawn out of the book and then placed on these pages and then they kinda start and end with the same scene picture
so i definitely think he recognized that and i
we always do and the quiet old lady whispering and he'll go
and he did it he did it here even though it was out of context of the rhythm of the book
so that was that was pretty good i guess he he definitely recognized it so
were you calling attention to certain things like that weren't that weren't in this rendition of the book
to kind of help him remember it
um i think i did when we uh opened this first page i told him like look it's the great green room the book starts off in the great green room there was and then it goes on to list the things so i you know i pointed out to him that this was the great green room and so maybe that gave him the frame of reference
and then throughout then you stuck to what the book was saying
i did
i did stick to what the book was saying for the rest so
so they talked about mittens and what were the other familiar things that you think regardless of the number
oh the uh
oop
the cows and the three little bear
i think i mean i think all of it
there's bowls of mush and telephones and socks
seven socks though that doesn't make any sense
they need an extra sock
well you always miss you always lose one
you always lose one
that's true
um and i know balloons
he really likes the red balloons
but there's only one red balloon in the book not nine
yeah i mean i really i think he recognized all of it
um
all of it
that's right
uh and then they yeah like i said they and then they end the book with the same picture
honey
he's a little tired
okay well just i just wanted to go over the other books that you read
if you wanna just take me through the familiar do you play peekaboo for example
we do play peekaboo and he'll play it
he'll uh you know pick up blankets
he'll initiate the game
um you know picking up blankets or whatever he can find
or like going behind a curtain
that type of thing
and he'll he'll play peekaboo and he'll he'll initiate it
um
so it's a lot he actually does a lot of what the book
yeah
yep
yeah he uh he loves lift the flap books
he does find those very exciting
um and yeah we do do do a lot of peekaboo
and i think he's familiar with some of the objects like you know balls he definitely has a a good understanding of balls and hats
and curtains
um i thought it was kind of neat that when we went through it a second time he was much faster because the flaps don't all lift from the bottom some of them lift from the top and some of them have kind of an angular uh turn to them
and the first time through he was try to pull it from the bottom on all of them but then the second time through he kind of was able to go more quickly to where they pull down from
so he i guess the maybe that's why he likes to look at books a bunch of different times because he gets more out of it each time
so
he remembers things
did you give mommy the baby
thank you
and then was there another book that you read
um what we did
oh we put we read the put me book
which he kind of lost interest in part way through but he would he stayed into it as long as i was asking him questions about what the different color spots were
but i think perhaps he was just less able to follow follow this one
there were probably some words in there that were different
yeah
it's uh
and a little bit i guess it's a little bit wordier
than say the peekaboo baby where every every page has variations on the same phrasing
uh where as this one was kind of changing everyone
although are you more interested in it now
see different spots
and we've never been to the zoo have we
some day
out out with you
what uh so this book i guess was talking about colors
it yeah
it it says that it's um a book of colors
and so it's uh this animal that wants to be in the zoo and they kick him out so they he but he's showing the children that they would put him in if they could see what he can do which is change the color of his spots every every time he wants to
oh okay
so you know he chan so yeah so it goes through and does little rhymes and leads up to ho what color the spots are
does he know those colors
yep
he knows he basically knows like if you have a the what the basic crayola marker box
he knows all his basic colors
that's like when we got to they call their spots violet and i asked him what color it was and he said purple
and you know i figure that that's pretty much the same thing so
right
yeah so he knows all the colors
um and now and now i don't think he knows what that animal is i think it's a made up animal
does he have a favorite color
um
when when we very first started talking about colors he was obsessed with yellow
he i mean kinda before he understood exactly how colors worked uh he would say everything was yellow
you would ask him what color that red sweater was and he's say yellow
he knew it was a color and he knew you were asking about a color
but now he actually will say he'll say all of his colors and correctly identify things but
he still he still likes yellow
especially yellow cars
every time we see a yellow car he gets very excited so
interesting
so that must be that must be the color
yeah
today he's wearing gre i thought you might have said like green or blue he's wearing that today
yeah
like sometimes you know kids will be like i want to wear this
not showing that preference yet huh
yeah well if i if i pull two things out and i say do you want to wear this or this he'll usually point to one or pick up one and throw it away and so i figure he wants the other one but uh we didn't do that today
okay
well i think that's all the questions i have unless you want to add something else about the session
you know i think uh i think it was good
he's it's he's very focused in here he's not always this focused at home
that's kind well it might be also his uh shyness that you
yeah
yeah
he's going through a little phase
what what do you think that is
what do you think this is
it's a slice of cheese
i'm gonna turn the camera
we're we are basically done
okay
i just wanna put uh something i didn't i started the camera late
so i'm just gonna put today's date and that um the i d number
for the camera
so we're done
oh
you did a good job
you did
oh
no i don't know that i should have mentioned this on the camera i thought it was really interesting at the beginning of it he kept on looking over at you
like everytime i'd ask him a question he'd look over at you all to kinda be like are they listening to me
alright i'm just gonna
okay

stay still buddy
what um what toys did he go through to or to first
um the plastic toys
um like which ones
um i believe it was the pizza the cookie and the spoon
the same thing as the last
oh right
and was there anything that you were trying to get him to play with
the book
which one
this well this one and the foot book
yeah usually he won't sit still for books
um from your last visit what types of toys were he interested and um and was that different from this visit
um it was the same thing he was interested in the plastic toys
um he played with them more of what they are used for
like tryin drink
and do you have any of these toys at home
any of the stuffed animals or that he might recognize
um not that i know of
um i'm just trying to think
no i don't think we have any of those
uh my daughter has plastic food and plates and stuff that he plays with
but they're not the exact they're not the exact kind
right but because he's older he might you know recognize more stuff
yeah
are you playing with that
there's nothing in there
it's pretend
pretend bottle
pretend ice
he was playing with um
yeah the sp
yeah the spaghetti the keys
the um pizza
bottles
but you pushed over the baby he thought it was funny
um
no we're not gonna go play with the computer
that's good
um is there anything that does he read a lot or at home he doesn't read a lot
we try but he doesn't sit still
he'll sit still for like half a book occasionally a whole book
um he's into the mechanical things like trying to break through doors
try to get through safety gates
um he likes to build
uh he carries around toy bins to build stairs to get to shelves
um what are you doing over there
yeah
quite different from your sister
there's nothing over here
okay well that's basically it
okay
so i'd just like to ask you a few questions
okey doke
um which items did you play with first
the play food
which kinds of food do you think she knows
she knows she goes for these and tries to drink out of them the bottles and the cup
okay
she picks up everything
she likes the peas the best
she always has
i dunno if they just taste good
or they i mean they feel good on her gums
they must
she spends a lot of time chewing these
everytime she comes
um i don't know if shh she recognizes any of this stuff
what items did you show her
uh i showed her the pizza and the ice and the waffles
she tries to eat all of it
like she's like and then she puts it down
so you know it's food don't you
yes
were there other items you showed her
um the baby
she usually likes the babies but i like baby dolls but this one's a little bit too too 
yeah
and then all of the toy or that's stuffed animals the animals that she recognizes any way
like i didn't show her the beaver i dunno that's a little bit
yeah i'm not sure
or an otter
maybe an otter
i dunno even know what it is
so i didn't show her that
um what other animals did she
um i called these horses
she thought this was a chicken
a chicken
she knows rooster
um donkey
dog
uh i think that's it
that's it
yeah
and what kind of items is she most interested in
you think what kind of things you have at home
well because we don't have play food at home yet she likes to play with the food
mostly i think it's novel
and she's obsessed with eating things
what kinda things does she like to eat
chicken nuggets
chicken nuggets
and fruit
what else do you like to eat dorothy
hey
what do you eat
anything that i'm eating she wants
if i give it to her she won't eat it but if i eat it then she'll want it
she likes pizza
she likes pizza yeah
does she like pasta or
unhunh
so she didn't really care for it
when she was really young i assumed that she thought this was like like a nipple or something
because she was like
maybe
i guess she came here when she was i dunno when you start the study
at a year maybe
younger
yeah
so when she was that li that age she would suck on those
what kind of things does she like to drink
um juice
uh she still has her nighttime bottle
so she goes for the bottle always
and tries to see to get the liquid out of that
and milk and water
does she like sweets
of course
what kinda desserts does she eat
um whenever i'm having chocolate she gets some
so usually it's just chocolate stuff
uh i don't really give her candy
brownies cake
nibbles on that stuff
anything chocolate i think
um fruit
like frozen frozen bananas she likes
does she like sandwiches
do you feed or is she kinda little for sandwiches
she picks them apart
and eats them one layer by o each
she likes the bread
and leaves the meat
can you think of other foods she played with
i tried she knows the form of cheese as in like cheese sticks
so when i told her this was cheese she was like
yeah
she looked a little bit confused
how about any of these or
unhunh she didn't really
like this this stuff she doesn't know what it is i don't think
does she recognize those
she tried to eat the cookie
and this
uh i don't think she recognizes it
um
has she not had this before
she has but not like out of the she doesn't seen the jar you know so it's like
she just sees it when it's applied to bread
she doesn't know like what the stuff in the boxes is
yeah
it's kinda odd that they design toys like this
yeah
um i think she thought this was cheese
maybe
i think that's it
and then the meat
um does she know where this goes
unhunh
or did you refer to this
i did i called it hamburger and she's like
okay
do you like mcdonalds dorothy
do you like mcdonalds
did you call this pasta or what did you call this
i called it nothing
oh okay
i dunno what i called it
that's what she does she'll go
does she have toys that rattle at home
she played with those um
do you let her play with yours
yep
and then we put them in here and it made a racket so she liked that noise
and she shook this and emptied it out
okay
um has she started using utensils
which ones does she use
spoon and fork
okay
she didn't i don't think she recognized that for as a spoon
no knives yet
nope
keys
yeah you gotta be bigger to use a knife
they're scary
do you read to her a lot at home
uh huh
um she turns the pages of her own books and she liked this one because
full of animals obviously
because she's into animal identification
these days
there's one other animal that you didn't mention um
i didn't tell her the bear
okay
there's that one patriotic animal
oh this
she thought it was a chicken
what did you call it
i called it an eagle
okay
and then i said tweet
i was like
okay
and this i didn't she doesn't know what these are
seal
i think
good guess
that is kind of unclear
seal pup
harp seal pup
very specific
was she interested in telling time i noticed you
unhunh i don't think she's like uh i've never really talked to her about time and clocks and stuff
what did you call this
uh i called it nothing i didn't think i i don't think i talked to her about it
is that peanut
you want the pen
are you drawing something
and plates
she put her food on the plate
you know food goes on plates don't you
yeah
alright well thanks so much
oh no problem
oh she likes the babies shoes
she likes shoes
oh shoes
okay
they don't quite match the outfit do they
i know a little boy or girl
i think it's supposed to be a boy
so i just have a few questions for you
okay
um what toys did he seem uh most interested in this time
he liked the baby huh
and the food
so does the food contain items that you use
let's see pizza uh he pretty much liked it all
did you not eat enough breakfast buddy
i think we pretty much touched every single food item
thank you for the pizza
and stuck it in our mouths
you probably wanna clean that
um and like what about the ones that he's like the least interested
well he did a lot more playing with all the toys
he probably spent the least amount of time with the stuffed animals but he did play with them
i guess he didn't touch the clock
or the keys
so
do you remember what the keys
he's always gone for the food
this is new the baby
like when he very first came in he said baby and he picked it up and he like that's new
i don't know if that's we're having a baby so we're talking about babies a lot
or he's kind of into a new phase with that so that's new
um do you think he recognizes the names
yeah
um he knows the na er recognizes can't say but knows the names of a lot of the different foods
spoon dog bear bird um book
bottle um peas bread pasta
oh yeah that's good feeding the baby
cup pizza juice
ice cookie um duck
yeah baby
those um are probably the main things that he knows
um do you have any of the same toys at home
we have the big um version of the put me in the zoo book
the like full um size one
pap er the hard cover but it's got paper inside and it has it's the full length story
we haven't read it in a while but we have read it
yeah put me in the zoo
um we don't have any play food at home
we have a lot s um stuffed bears
he has a stuffed bear that he sleeps with
we have a baby doll that's about half the size of this one and it's like soft
that we haven't really played with um
would you say that he prefers to play with food or i'm sorry playing with toys over books or just does he seems to prefer just reading books or a little of both
i'd say it's both
today he didn't seem that interested in reading but at home he'll like get out books and like flip through them and stuff like that
his brother is into reading
so he kind of does whatever his brother is doing
okay i think that is all we have for
what's that
your baby
so which toys did you think that she liked
i i know you've been here a couple a times and she liked ones better than the last time do you remember er
it's definitely the baby
the baby's on top huh
most definitely
did she play with any of the food at all
not yet
um ye
she i think recognizes it more now
ye
as
oops
actual food and knows what it is
ye does she eat any of these things at home
ye
um she has waffles a lot
ye
cheese bread peas
good deal good deal
um did she she play with any of the stuffed animals at all not really

ye
we love cookies
yum
no
just pretend
you don't wanna get all sugared up on cookies you know
so i think we're done
alright
alright
yeah that swatting thing though that's new
tries to swat me
argh oh you want to sit okay never mind
anything interesting that
um i don't know i don't know most i might say the waffles
are there other things that he recognizes
um he should recognize like the bread
and the pizza
do you have
some of yeah yeah
um
not a whole lot
do you have any special or
the waffles
the waffles
definitely
yeah yeah
i noticed you were naming a lot of and things
at home
yeah yeah um plates and bowls
things that he uses ev every day
alright um is there something that you think he should know or
um of what he picked up
let's see i don't think we knew what this was
there was one thing
disinterested
he's not really intere he you know out of the plush things he li he likes puppies
puppies is really his only thing right now so when he picked this one up that one really didn't do anything for him
arf yes
okay i also noticed he was like sounding out a lot of noises that animals made
yeah he like he's always liked sounds
like just sounds and singing type things
so so we tend to try and do the animal sounds a lot
and with the with the colors he has some books at home that have the foam on the cover
and he he like points at like a piano and we make the noises
which is why we're doing the colors like that
to identify
um i have no idea
he just i think he just likes the fact that you know he's he's making it like he's pressing something and he's getting a reaction from us
so the noise itself doesn't matter but but getting a reaction does
what about colors
what colors do you think he knows
i don't know that he knows any colors
he was a lot of the colors though
yeah it's it's um like i said it's just we have a we have a book of colors that's very similar to what he's seeing in the clock
so the way we play with it at home is just by kind of singing the colors
but i don't know if he can distinguish any colors
it's just one of those things that we're working on
body parts colors
yeah body parts too
yeah
um he doesn't he doesn't say any of those words yet
but but those are the basic things that we're you know trying for
um okay um at home
um well not this one but we he has puppies
um and he's got the regular good night moon not this one
he has some food
not not any of these that we have
um he has a book very similar to this with the the animals and the things you can touch and feel
all the animals you seen before
he's seen all of all of these
yeah
um yeah he's seen all the farm animals here
um the books we have have like the same kind of touch and feel of those particular animals too so he's seen all those
the only ones he really identifies with right now are puppies and kitties
we have two cats at home so um
i can't open that
that's juice though
that's that's play juice
do you think he prefers toys over books
no actually in generally he prefers books over toys
yeah i mean here it's a little different
i think but at home he he's always bringing us books
yeah
um
he has nothing like it
we need to get him one he's gonna have a little brother soon
but um he has nothing baby dollish at all
he hasn't really been around many small babies so
yeah i mean we kinda just point babies out as babies but he doesn't have much interest
at all
he knows like what
yeah and i think he underst i honestly think he understands a lot
so if i tell what it is he you know you know i told him that was apple juice so he gets an idea of it
yeah he he loves the word eyes
he's always been like that where he latches onto certain words and thinks they're fun and eyes is one of 
so we've been trying to take that into you know body parts
oh okay well thank you
okay
hopefully you guys are finding some interesting things out
yeah i don't know the only thing he has as a favorite right now is his shoes there
okay you guys did a great job
thanks
i'm gonna ask you a few questions
sure
um what do you think francis was the most interested in
um like in general the fake food i guess
but it's probably specifically the baby doll
okay
do you have um a doll at home
i don't think we do
he sees baby dolls at daycare
okay
and they just got some new babies at daycare
he was the youngest for a long time
um so that might also be why he was interested in the baby doll
so
do you pretend food at home
we don't have very much pretend food
okay
what um was here that he recognized though or that he's had
um well i think they do have some pretend food at daycare
okay
um and some of the books we have or he's probably seen at daycare
which of the books
um
yeah we have karen katz books like that i don't think we have that exact one
um
do you play this game at home though
oh yeah
definitely we do
where's francis
where's francis
no that's the baby
where's francis
peekaboo
so usually he likes that
um
does he have this book
yeah we have regular goodnight moon
um and another bright baby like with the same pictures of ducks
has he has he seen these animals before
the ones that were in that book
yeah definitely
definitely
i mean probably the same almost the same pictures the bright baby books have
yeah
which animals does he recognize
um the probably these ducks and sheep
what else
that's right those are the ducks
not the horse i don't think
i noticed when um he was playing with the baby he picked up um different containers and utensils
yeah
does he identify any like utensils and stuff
yeah um well yeah we're working on knives and forks at home
or knives not knives
forks and spoons at home
that's right you've got pizza
and we just had a lot of ice this past weekend grandpa was in town
so um
thank you
and he yeah we've been working with plates and stuff
oh and he uses a sippy cup
and he has for over a year now
or about a year
um he's eighteen months and i hate bottles
but he se you know still sees the bottles at home
or at daycare i mean
so
um which foods has he had here
yeah he's had all these foods we just feed him regular
um adult food
so he was excited definitely excited about the ice
and what did he try and feed me
oh the cookie
i mean when we give him spaghetti and meatballs of course it doesn't look like that
but
he was interested in that
yeah definitely the waffle
i we haven't really fed him too much waffles
maybe he's seen 
okay
um
how sandwiches
yeah he loves bread we feed him a sandwich every day
okay
does he
yeah we don't really i mean he doesn't get to chance to just play with cans and jars they're kind of heavy and stuff
thank you francis
does he like
yeah well he sticks it in his mouth and then he tries to give it to me with his mouth so
yeah he's very generous so
thank you
okay
you like putting your teeth in the holes
is that fun for you
there's your teeth
that's right
the texture of it
yeah definitely
um yeah so he played a little with this thing that i couldn't figure out what it was
and a little with the hamburger too
but not the chee the other cheese thing
um and he didn't do much with the plates
i think i thought he would
we always eat togeth
you know the grownups at least have plates he usually does too so
oh you wanna feed the baby
that's very nice of you francis
do you think you need to use the smaller spoon babies have a smaller mouth
where's the smaller end
there's the
this one
yeah there's a small spoon for a baby
yeah
oh
try
thank you
oh thank you
and then i thought he showed me the dolls hands and then he made his hands go like that too
i thought that was really interesting
yeah that is interesting
yeah
he's very good at counting
do you practice that
yeah he at the daycare she's awesome and she has like a math curriculum for these kids you know zero to three years old
um and they do hand over hand
and he'll take my hand now and point at things in books and he'll go which is counting
so
that's right
so and i always say oh i'm so glad to hear it
and then we'll work on one and two and three coming up so
yeah
yeah
yeah
bread that's right
what kind of sandwich can you make
in that jar

right
that's a healthy ice sundae
right it has the fruit in it
and we just had a bunch of strawberries he has bananas every day so
yeah
okay
we talk about and he pointed to the cherry and trying to explain where it's familiar from or if it isn't
it's mommy doesn't like it very much or something like that
there was one sippy cup
yes
oh here's your sippy cup
do you think he recognizes what might be in it
maybe he does have very
that's mommy's button francis

do you have these books at home or similar books
we have mister brown
and we read it a lot
we read it a lot i usually try to let him pick whatever book he wants to hear

uh we also have another one called um bright eyes
uh it's african american book
and um
another one called the pelp
we read those three a lot
a lot we read them a lot
so he hasn't really you know gravitated to any other wait you know we have you know quite a few books maybe about nothing crazy maybe about twenty or so but you know those tend to be his favorites
yeah i don't think he would know the books so he was really interested
yeah he does yeah
he'll um
he does like the book there's also bookbag i hear
who's_my_mom or something like that uh it was a it's iridescent it's got nice colors in it
oh okay
and um he actually looked at this one and when he was pointing he was pointing to all the colors
oh okay
on it so there was something but he didn't seem to be all that interested in the book itself as much as the you know the front page of it
i know this was really interesting this one i don't know if it's like the texture
the texture book which we don't have i was thinking of actually getting a texture book and i hadn't gotten it yet but my um
my niece
has a texture book
i don't know how it goes but she's got you know i think it's a sheep and a cow and
you know a couple things in there so he at night and i didn't know if he played with it or not he's with my mother during the day but i guess
right
there's something about it that he does
what other animals in there has he seen before
he's seen pooh
okay
everything with four legs is a bak bak
aw
dogs horses it's a bak bak
he kinda says it differently and i guess it just because i'm used to hearing it i know what the difference is and i'll say yeah that's your bear
um
and he'll
bak you know bak you know bak bak is a little bit harder if it's a dog
and if he's a little more uncertain but it's got four legs it's like bak bak
you know that it's a little softer but bear i think he's trying to associate the bak bak with the bear it's like bu bo bak or ba bak
it's it sounds different to me it might be in my mind but it sounds different
but he's got a pooh at home and a bear at home
but he calls it bak bak
um he didn't seem to be interested in any of the other animals
um
mostly the food and the books seemed to
to be his uh his thing
and climbing
he likes climbing on mommy
aw
that's cute i saw that you were like on to the um
no
has he seen them before though
he's seen i think all of these before
uh with the previous you know with our previous visits i'm pretty sure he's seen
um this one he's the bear he was uh once upon a time kind of interested in it he has a similar bear at home but he hasn't really played with that bear
lately so it's kind of interesting that he still said oh bak bak
so
um but no none of the other ones i think at one point he was interested in this but i think it was because of the
spangle
ness of it
nothing really i think he remembered this guy he i remember when he first saw the hair he was
you remember him
you remember him he's mister
or maybe we have nightmares i don't know
um
so but uh the food uh
the food seems to be the most
the thing he was most interested in
how dolls
not really dolls
um
he actually um destroys my niece's dolls when she's
aw
i wouldn't say destroy but he um
he um
has no real love for them he does you know he'll take them and sort of you know toss them across the so i was like just like sharon's doll
but um but i was kind of worried that he would like maybe toss the babydoll but he didn't so um
since she usually sends her into tears
whenever he does it
usually it's fine i mean nothings been broken yet but you know
you know the fact that her baby is sailing across the room and he's
you know looking quite euphoric and she's like completely distraught
so
but yeah he's at that throwing stage we're trying to um
curb
um okay
have you played this game before
peek a
usually with objects like you know blanket
um or you know a you know something that's big enough to cover the face
mostly with the blanket
mostly with the blanket no uh not so much the book
we don't have a peek a book but we do play we play peek a
i don't know if we really do we really call it peeka yeah
we so i don't know if we really call it peek a we call it like i see
you know do you see me i see you do you see me kind of thing
yeah
or where's mommy
sweetiepie did you
it's okay it's falling apart
also um i noticed you were a lot of like um sounds and things and associating with the animals
sweetiepie stop that
it's fine
um you said it's like you think that helps um identify the animals
um
i don't know yet
uh i really can't say that right now
um
i never really taught him bar bak bak for the dog but he somehow went there i don't know how he got there i don't know if he we actually have dogs
and i guess that i don't know if that what is what it sounds like to him
oh
okay
or
but
i uh
but yeah i do i try i well if i say it's a cow i say y i say it's a cow
cow says moo or something like that
or you know the dog says ruff rufff or i usually say ruff ruff i don't that's why i'm like where did he get bak bak from but
i guess maybe that's what that sounds like to them
mkay
um
but yeah i don't know if or not
but um
i guess we'll find out
okay well thank you so much
thank you
he did such a great job
thank you
so there's nothing wrong with him he's not like a defective baby
we're actually all done
okay
yeah
oh it's still on me
there it is
i was lookin for the clip
i was holding it
should be alright
that's okay
you can still wear it um i have a few questions to ask
okay
this is a book on the farm book
do you wanna look at it
what happened
she got tangled up there we go
yeah it's a sheep
so what did you all play with first
um before the camera was on
uh the books
she she definitely
which books did you read to her
uh what was it the peekaboo book
she handed all to me but uh this was the one that we read
okay
do you read at home with her
yeah
yeah the nanny reads with her a lot
what other books did you read to her
um the foot feet book foot book
okay
and i think that's the only two that we actually looked
were there other ones that you tried to read that didn't work out
um i guess i opened up this one
to the duck
but then she moved on quickly
okay
does she have any of these books at home
um she's got similar so she's got this the peekaboo baby
um slightly different
but same concept
um and she's got a goodnight moon book
okay
but it's not the same one
yeah this one's a little different
book
yeah
what what did what else did you play with after
um so she picked up a lot of the animals
which ones
the zebras
and the goose
that she thought was a duck
and the bear
the bear
and the bees
okay
and the dog
okay
what did you call the dog
uh did i call it a puppy
or doggy
um
i don't she didn't call it a doggy though i don't remember what she
oh and she played with yeah she liked the baby
the shoes
and the food
okay
food item um items
thank you
we cuddle the baby
um what other animals did she play with that you not mention
um
aw baby fell it's okay
yeah i mean she picked up the re uh the frog
something with a hat i remember you mentioning
yeah what had the ha
oh the beaver
the beaver had the ha
oh if this is a beaver
okay
i'm not sure what that is
and then she seemed to recognize the noise this animal makes
yep the sheep
yep
i thought she'd be more entertained with the magnets she's her uh nanny the other baby in the nanny share has magnets and she loves the magnets
you got keys
yeah keys
keys they make a funny sound don't they
um what else did you play with
uh she seemed to go through just about every one of these food toys
uh the pizza the ice the peas
the hamburger
okay
the waffles
she didn't pick up the cheese
and then the spoons the measuring spoon and the the regular spoon
plate
cup
she picked up the clock
okay
great
um are these
and she went back to the baby a couple times
okay does she she picked this one up
yeah
oh yeah
both spaghettis there were two of them here
um
spaghetti
and the water pitcher
well water
she thought there was water in here
okay and there's one dessert food item
um she picked up this one and she picked up the sundae
okay
there's something else
oh here it is
okay
alrighty
something round and circular
uhoh the hamburger patty thingy
okay
where did that go madelyn
oh the cookie
she picked up the cookie briefly
okay
but
i'm not sure she would recognize what a cookie is
with the baby you played with um
shoes that's right
and um the baby had a bandaid
what did you call that bandaid
uh i asked her if the baby had a booboo i think
okay
ice
yeah
ice
it's just a toy
i'll try it
delicious
what's that
is that bread
toast
alrighty we're all done
okay
yep
you all did a great job
thanks so much for coming
toast exactly
say thank you
madelyn can you say thank you
there you go
good job
aw thanks
good job
keys yeah
alright honey
you ready to go
alrighty i can ask you some questions and then
okay
um so just generally um tell me about what kind of toys you played with today
well um he played with the pretend food
and the books a little bit
and the baby doll a little bit
and the clock
okay
um and what kind of things did he do with them
he moved a lot of the toys from one part of the room to the other
into a pile
um he wanted the doll to chew on his foot
um
he didn't seem that interested in reading the books for the most part
just kind of looking at them and moving them around
okay
um what kind of toys did did you see a change between the last times that he came in and this time
if i can remember that far back
um some of the things he did were the same like before he also tried to move a lot of toys from one part of the room to the other
but some of the things were different like wanting the shoe to go on the baby doll
and he seemed more interested in the i guess the details of some of the toys like that this came apart
and he was trying to take the lid off the peanut jar
okay
which doesn't come off but
and i don't recall him doing those things before
okay
um are there any toys you said he wasn't interested in any books anything else that he wasn't particularly interested in
the stuffed animals
he did a little bit of moving some of these things
but he mostly ignored the stuffed animals
which is also what he does at home
he's not that interested in stuffed animals at this point
okay
um do you think that he recognizes the names of any of these items
yes
some of them
which ones do you think
um like the doll just book in general
um probably like he knows what real bread is so he probably recognized that as bread
cup spoon things like that
okay
um is he able to say any of these items or no
he's not
he doesn't really say very many words
yet at this point
but he he recog he know his comprehension is a lot better than his production at this point so
okay
um so he played pretty similarly here to as how he plays at home
um yeah for the most part
except he stayed in one spot
more than he would at home
and he is more interested in boo i guess because they're the books that are familiar to him but at home he carries the books around and asks us to read them to him and he's more
but they're also a lot of new toys here so
that may be why he ignored the books today
and he doesn't have pretend food at home either
so that could be the the draw of the novelty of that
okay
is there anything else you'd like to add
um i don't think so
okay
then we're done with this
is it okay if i ask you some questions
oh yeah
um what do you think uh she liked the most
i think the baby wins the day
does she have baby dolls at home
no but um they have a lot of stuffed animals at the at our house and then at the place she goes each day for her child care
which is just at another family's house
we share a nanny with another family
and apparently my husband does the drop off but every morning when she gets there she and the other little girl feed all the babies
and they're all the animals and everything and they walk around and feed them all
so i think that's part of her her routine these days
interesting
yeah
so what are some things that um did you see her do anything new with the baby
well i have never seen her with a real baby
okay
so that was kind of interesting to see her actually putting it in the baby's mouth
i mean usually we have things like this that don't necessarily have clear mouths and so it's just kinda like anywhere
and this was clearly i know where it's supposed to go
um
yeah
but this is kind of her thing you know she'll she'll just kind of go from thing to thing
yes
ow
ow
and she'll kinda get fixated on something for a while and need you to pay attention to it
you know she'll bring it to your attention
uhoh
do you think she understands the concept of the bandaid and the words that you're using
i think some but probably not all of them
but i'm i mean from the time she was very little i've been shocked at how much she understood
like things that sort of would freak me out
i would say something i thought for the first time ever and she would go do it
or look to it
and so i've learned from the beginning i i just kind of narrate everything
i probably do it too much
watch out
hold on
stop
rosie
there you go
um but i think she understands a lot
rosie
can you give the bottle to mommy
please
i don't like that you're eating it
that's for other kids to play with
and we don't need to like pass germs around
how the uh stuffed animals
how did she play with them today
mommy's gonna take this
this is gonna be mommy's
you can play with this
i'm gonna stick it in your pocket
i think pretty typically
she's very into the animals
it's bye bye
it's bye bye
it's all bye bye
bye bye
she loves dogs
so that didn't surprise me that she would look for dogs
she's she totally understands now
yeah
what's that
yeah
i didn't know she knew winnie the
so that was kinda surprising to me that she would c like call him by name
okay
and find him
i didn't know she knew that so i'm sure they have that at the other house
and the same thing happened with elmo
like two months ago
i had no idea she knew any of these characters at all
and then she's we had a book and elmo was in it
i'd never even noticed that
and she was like obsessed with elmo
and it was one of those things where we really didn't even know she knew elmo
yeah
yeah
does she know the uh animal names here
she probably knows she can point out animals and then when we say it she'll repeat us
so the ones that she can point out in a book are definitely you know chicken dog bee she knows
she knows a lot of their sounds
i don't think she would ever like she wouldn't know that's a goose but if we pointed out something and said goose she would know that a goose says honk honk
okay
so she probably i would think she would know zebra
come here rosie
where's a zebra
do you know where a zebra is
can you show mommy
i don't know if you know that one
where's the zebra
you like chairs
are there stickers
sticker
how about any new animal thing er animals
you mean the ones that she doesn't know or that she played with
like any novel animals
this would be definitely novel i have no idea if this is a gopher a beaver a hedgehog i don't know
um i guess this would be a sea otter we don't talk talk about otters very much
rosie what's this
is this a fox
or a weasel
i dunno
we don't talk about them
oh here's two otters
that's an otter
but these are probably the only new ones
yeah
what's that
um how the foods
um you mean what's new or how she played with them or
both
um she doesn't really probably know ice
we don't experience that very much
i've i thought she'd go more for the cheese but maybe it she's starting to figure out that that's like fake or something
we don't we don't have she just got for christmas but we haven't opened yet the giant thing of pretend foods
okay
so she has a grocery cart but she doesn't fill it with food she fills it with toys and
so here i think the pizza she definitely like that's a very iconic thing that she can point out
but i don't think she can i thought maybe she'd associate that with peanut because she loves peanut
but i think the jar looks so different than the one we have that she doesn't get that that's what we're talking about
but i could be wrong
do you see any bread
where's the bread
no
you don't want to
you want a cracker
i don't see a cracker
do you see one
you know she it's funny because she used to like books would be the first thing she goes for
and now she's much more interested in sort of that dramatic play and like tan you know the tactile sort of animals and books are more secondary now
so i read them a lot and push them a lot but she used to sort of just sort of gravitate and look at books and things like that and not really care as much about stuffed animals
and now it's sort of flip flopped
rosie really
seriously
they're gonna have to like wash everything down after you
are those peas
that's normal
are those peas
how is she playing with the food or how were you trying to get her to play with
i know
i think i was trying to get her to see like one of the things we've we've been working with a specialist because she's so underweight for her age
and she's been diagnosed with a infantile anorexia feeding disorder
and essentially what they've kind of been working with us on is helping her understand hunger
because they just think kids like this don't have the same hunger cues that other kids do
and so i try to do a lot of play of where like the baby's hungry and we feed the baby
and i try to do that to help her understand that food is for feeding not for playing and throwing and whatever
so i think i probably push that and then i get self conscious that i'm pushing the food
so it's always like this battle in my head
which is characteristic they say of infantile anorexia is that mom is creating conflict in the feeding relationship
so that's always awesome
but you're but it's you're just wanting them to grow and eat and be healthy and you know that they're not
um so i don't i've been working on that mommy doesn't know exactly the way to play with you about food
yeah
does she have like favorite foods
um yeah she loves sausage
it's like this random thing that we can almost always get her to eat
she does like peanut
and she loves
you wanna go night night
seriously
well that's later
you just got up from a night night
oh
so we have some favorite foods but often times our issue is not that it's a food she doesn't like it's that she will eat it in such small quantities
so she'll love a food she'll take one bite of it and then she'll be done
you know and she'll start going all done
all done
down
all done
and she's serious about it
if you try to like do anything else it starts a holy war
yeah
you're just too busy
you're just too busy
here hold on
let's put this down
okay step up
put your foot up
she's a good listener
yeah
thank you
oh now we see it
yes
so she seems to get the concept of things coming in and saying hello and saying goodbye
oh yeah
oh yeah
and what to do when you get to a door
she she's super aware of all that stuff
she's extremely social and perceptive
she picks up on things really fast
that's one of the reasons like for a long time we weren't really worried about the eating thing because she was kind of off the charts in ster in terms of her gross motor fine motor language like everything seemed to be ahead of where it should be so i was like obviously we don't have a stunting issue here
but what i didn't realize is that that's also common with some of those eating disorders
is that it's those kids that can't be slowed down to eat
food is more of a stimulation than a
right
that didn't mess anything up
yeah they
put it in here like that
like that
mommy fixed it
mommy fixed it
okay
can you say hi
my favorite new thing she says is see ya
we said i said it once and she just like did it clear as day
see ya
you ready to go
you wanna go bye bye
go find daddy
daddy went to home depot
yeah he went to buy a gift card
yeah
yeah he went bye bye
camera
you're a smarty
she's freakish
you're like wise beyond your years little one
we finally just turned her car seat around even though she hit a year eight months ago she still is like just under the twenty pound mark that she was supposed to be
and we were like okay we're doing a ten hour drive home for christmas we're not keeping her faced backwards
it's like she's
oh thank you
she's in a whole new world
she sits in the seat and bounces and calls out everything she sees excitedly
she jumps up and down she loves getting in the car
we're like man we should have done this a long time ago
but then again you wouldn't have been safe
right
we need to be safe
yeah
sausage
oh that's okay
i'm gonna put this up rosie
is she using utensils
yeah
that was one of the things they actually told us to start working on was to like give her a challenge while she was eating so she didn't get bored so quickly
so she has a fork and i have a fork
and we both work on it
and she's good at using a fork
like she can get it the first try fork it get it right to her mouth
come here
we give her forks rather than spoons because it's easier for her to not make a mess with the fork
come here rose
come here
what's this
what's this
rosie
she keeps calling for her friend sasha
you want you want to read that
i don't know where sasha is
who's this
what's that
elephant
oh it's barney
right
that's baby bop
i remember that from my babysitting days
baby bop
see
baby bop
say hi baby bop
hi
she painting
puppet show
what are those
balloons
and a tree
welcome to our puppet show
what's that
balloons
you love balloons
do we get one every time we go to the grocery
do you get a balloon
yeah
can you go put that back
go put it away
please
don't knock anything down
come here
something
she's like say what
were there any um did we talk about foods that she may not know
come here rosie
no we didn't
um this i have no idea what this is
so spam speck
i don't know
um she she would probably
rosie
come here
sorry
i'm afraid i'll break the mic again
come here sweetie
yeah
you wanna sit on the chair
here you go
come sit on the chair
wanna sit
there's stickers
you see the doggy stickers
she probably doesn't know any of those mystery meats
and i bet i know one thing you know
can you sit
what's this rosie
can mommy show you
what's this
what is that
that's not pizza
what is it
it's a cookie
cookie
you don't get a lot of those but you know cookie monster likes cookies
okay but it's not real
it's just pretend
it's not real
watch
i'm gonna put it in your pocket
where'd it go
did you find it
i'm gonna hide it
where is it
aw are you hiding it
you found it
okay
you want down
you can get down
she's loving that
yeah
does she she's on to a cup now
well she yeah like we have a cup in the car but the bottle seems to be something she'll more consistently drink more out of it's like she associates that with finishing it
this all came on post bottle days
so it's weird it's like she'll still drink a whole bottle she knows to do that
so the doctor said go and stick with what she'll drink the stomach doesn't care how it comes in
so we do cups for water and milk sometimes but we tend to still use a bottle
and so she'll ask for a bottle and if we give her a cup she'll say okay i mean she'll still drink it but she'll ask for a bottle
woah
we do a lot of straws now that seems to be intriguing to her
oh no
i broke it off again
that seems to be intriguing for her so we'll do straws
we'll do smoothies
oh are you caught
there you go
all better
rosie do you see some stickers
where's your stickers
do you see boots
i see boots
i see doggies
i see butterfly
are those things she knows like um the different shoes
does she know shoes
yeah
yeah
she'll ask for boots versus her other shoes and so she knows the difference between that
right
we're big girl
are you big girl
oh my
she knows a lot of her body parts too which kind of always surprised me
i knew she knew like like head and ears and eyes
but then i started to realize that she knew shoulders knees fingers
and i was kind of like alright
mommy's gonna have to step up her game we're gonna have to do like shins and femurs and stuff
right
here you go baby
that's probably like i know one of the questions on there was what's her longest sentence or phrase or whatever it seems to be you know here you go baby
which is i think is what they say every morning when they feed the babies
that wasn't something we were saying
um it's funny like i asked her nanny one time like do you what do you say to them while you change their diaper because everytime i change rosie's diaper she keeps saying this same thing over and over and she goes is she saying i know i know i know and i'm like yeah and she said that's they get so they don't want to have their diaper changed and so she said i just sit there and say i know
i know you don't like it
i know
she's got this little southern accent
so they so the whole time they're changing their diaper i know
i know
it's hilarious
and it makes me laugh last year
last
sasha
last year i didn't know like you know little things like that
but now that her language is exploding she'll have these little phrases
and i'm i'll have to ask the nanny what is this all about
and she just laughs they don't do it for her
but they do it when no one's saying it
they they know that it's supposed to be said
so then they'll actually say it
right
and the other one was like um something like it's okay or it's okay
like when she'd bump her head she'd go it's okay
it's okay
sorry
sorry
and holly said that's because when they bump themselves you know we we sasha and i will say to rosie oh it's okay it's okay
we're sorry it hurts
and so she does that to herself
sorry
right
you really do love that
that's your favorite thing
feeding the baby
she's super cute
she is
she's so fun
she's a good girl
right rosie
you fun
are you fun
well i think that's all the questions i have for today
okay
um the next visit's gonna be in six months
and that'll be the speech eval
okay
um and do you want to be called for other studies in the mean time
sure that's fine
okay great
okay
okay
like i said this is our short visit
the key
blue key
um so what books were you reading to her
um we read goodnight moon on the and the foot book
and then do you think there's any words in i know that she really likes goodnight moon
um that she may recognize or
yeah
which ones did she say
uh i well she's got a really big vocabulary
um shh i mean i think she probably recognized pretty much all of them
she i mean we read this we don't have the counting book but we have goodnight moon and we read it a lot and she she knows most of the words
i mean especially the um the nouns you know
like i know when shh when i asked her what that is she said cow but she knows kitty
um she knows bear she knows chairs
um she knows all the numbers
she knows cow
and moon
and uh mush
and she knows phone she talks she loves phones
um and fox
i mean i don't know that she really remembers the last time she wore mittens so i maybe shh but she hears it in the book so
um and balloon definitely that was her favorite thing
and the houses
definitely knows stars is one of her favorite words
um well stars is one of her favorite things so she says stars all the time
um
night night
she says night night instead of good night but she likes night night a lot
what's that
that's called put me it's a book of colors
she really likes
sam
well that's the cat in
and all the ca all the doctor seuss characters she thinks are sam from uh green eggs
aw that's cute
um and then the other ones you said that or
um okay
well she definitely knows duckies
she knows the color words but she doesn't necessarily recognize what color is what
but she knows yellow and um mommy ducks
she knows splish splash from the bath
um she knows sheep
i don't think she knows a ewe and a ram but she knows sheep
and baby and coats
um horsie she knows
um brown eat stay
field
hay
cows definitely
um moo
she knows piggies and pink
funny
um she might not know what snout is
she nose sniffs sniffs around for food
i mean she mostly talks in sentences
those are peas
you know what that is
and then which of the stuffed animals do you think she was interested in
she likes pooh
we have um the classic pooh at home so he looks a little bit different
but she loves pooh
um and she i guess she liked this one when i told her it was pooh
um and she liked the doll
she loves dolls
um she didn't really pay much attention to the other ones
i saw she was interested in um the bandaid on the leg
yeah
well her big sister loves bandaids it's they're like her favorite thing
and she gets a bandaid as a as a prize at the end of the day if from when she started potty training
her if she has a dry day she gets a bandaid at the end of the day
so um i think that just because she knows emma's so into bandaids now she likes them too
so
you have to be when you're the younger sister
right
you have to follow the lead
right
um and do you have any similar toys to these at home
she has a bee but it's not like with the letters
i don't think she recognized what this was
um and like i said we have the pooh but it's a different version
um we don't have any plastic food
although we probably should get some because they really like that
were there any things that you think maybe she was more interested in previous visits
i don't remember
um i mean she do i think that last time we were here i think she played with the plastic food more
this time it seemed like she only played with the peas
but i don't know if she noticed it it was kind of behind me
oh now you notice it
that was it for us
that was great
great job sophia
you get a toy
oh boy
what's that
what's that
it's a waffle
i love waffles
daddy loves waffles
flat disk
yeah
he can keep playing i guess i just have a couple questions
oh sure bud
um so what do you
i don't know if he knows the cup doesn't work
yeah i know
um what what did he kinda start playing with first
well it looked like he started with the books but that was what i stopped with when i around and introduced all the things to him but he we read a lot of books
okay
yeah did
we have this one at this one at home
which oh okay
do you have any of the other ones at home
not these
okay
but last time we were here you had one that's like his favorite book at home
um the mister brown
oh
he really likes that one
yeah
what part do you like in mister brown
how does the thunder go
boom
he likes that
um what o what other books did you guys look at today
uh this one with the flaps
and this one with the the touch and feel things
and the foot
i'm surprised you didn't wanna look at this dan
what is it
he's very quiet today
he doesn't wanna say
yeah
um in any of the books did he seem to like any particular pages or pictures
um in the peekababy book he uh he really likes stars and he kinda sees a star
he points to it and says star
so there was one where there was a star on the hat
where's the star
there it is
this one you pull with the side
he always likes those
and so
and he likes the parts in the foot where i you know do the up and down
but we do that at home
well you definitely could tell he likes to look at books and
yeah
especially when he's feeling nervous
if if he can sit on someone's lap and be qu calm and quiet it helps settle him back down
yeah any time that we have to leave him with a babysitter we always tell her like as soon as we're out of the house pick up a book and he'll calm right down if you sit on if he sits on your lap and you read to him
oh that's nice that that works for him
yeah
so what else did you guys play with
he picked up almost every single animal
i think he was very curious about all of them
but most of them are animals he's never seen
oh yeah like what
like an otter and a deer
well i guess like he's seen pictures of zebras but we don't have any stuffed zebras
we have like you know a lot of kinds of bears
and dogs
but yeah i don't he didn't get to as far as the dogs even though you have three dogs
yeah
and we usually the animals that we i said this one other time when i was here but the animals that we have at home are usually ones that make noises so we can have a conversation with them but like an otter i don't know what noise an otter makes
i couldn't tell you
and like at home he really likes i mean i dunno maybe we give him stereotypically boy toys but he likes playing with trucks and balls and stuff
those are like his favorite things
we don't have any of those
i don't even think at the nursery at our church that there are any dolls
so he never sees dolls
he just doesn't
and we don't have they have play food at some of the places where he's like some uh friends' houses where he plays but it's not really like a big thing he doesn't play with it very often
so you said you don't really have play foods at home
are any of these things that he actually sees in you know real life
yeah
that he eats
our peas definitely
he never eats pizza he's never seen that food
and ice he wouldn't have ever seen in a cone
but all the fruits yeah some of them but not very many
peas definitely
yeah that one you could rip off with your teeth so stick with this one
yeah
and cheese
he certainly recognized the cheese
yeah
it looked like he was enjoying that
that's that's everyone's favorite
yeah
cheese
he's actually pretty close to saying that too
oh yeah
just then
that was the best i'd ever heard him say it
yeah
so is there is there anything here that um or that you usually play at home that we don't have here
yeah the his like a he he has a little truck and a little car and um
he at home he kind of wrestles with the stuffed animals
he's not gonna do that with animals he doesn't know
you know you gotta have a relationship with an animal before you can body slam it
but um and he likes puzzles you know the big chunky ones
um plays with those a lot
he likes uh to take a crayon and just draw on paper
well most of the time he'll draw a line and then he'll give me the crayon and tell me to draw something
then i have to draw stars that's his favorite thing
um and did you i guess notice anything about his play today that was different from at home
or was it pretty much
yeah he he was a little timid
but it's just he doesn't know the toys
and it's a different place
thank you
that's pretty normal
yeah
okay but i really think you could pull one off with your teeth
i'm gonna say no
you can stick with these squeezies
yeah um
what else was different daniel
i i i kind of rough house with him a little more at home than i would here
yeah
i like to pick him up and toss him
right
what is this
i don't understand this is like your first word
and you're not saying it
sometimes we'll like be anywhere
li anywhere we go he'll find the clocks and point to them
or he'll find the clock and say clock and then he'll kind of wait for me to find it
he really likes clocks
yeah
what else bud
anything else
what was your favorite thing daniel
do you like the numbers on the clock
oh you have blocks too he likes these blocks
really until about a month ago he really loved his shape sorting things but all the sudden he was done
but those were his favorite toys for like three or four maybe even more months than that
you know the things where it's holes and you put the circle in the circle
yeah
those are probably too noisy for a small area with a microphone
right yeah that would cause a lot of interference
the poor person who has to listen to it would probably blow their ears out
right sort out the
yeah
what's this daniel
what is that sound
that was a funny noise
did you like it
not so sure
beep beep
interference
alright well i think we got
what is that noise
it's okay
you all did a great job today
he he's so curious about everything
he's
he's like
he likes picking things up and examining them
yeah
and he's usually very independent about it
maybe a little less so just because i'm still here and he doesn't know you but
right
at home he'll he doesn't need me anymore
getting too big
did you have fun daniel
was that a yes or a no
yes
did you have fun
eh yeah
okay
alright
let me give you this back
alright so what was paul interested in
it appears the uh food toys
is that what he what did he go to first
that's what he went to first is the the toys that he recognized as like things that he knows at home
foods and stuff like that
things he knows words for
oh so you think he so he
he
recognized them all
yes
he came over and picked up the bread and said toast
so
so does he recognize them from do you have them at home
we don't have these toys at home
no
but he knows know what it is
i would think so
i mean he's seen it as you know breakfast you know toast for breakfast and stuff
please don't throw the toys
that's my guess
is that's why he
paul mommy asked you not to throw toys
do not throw toys
you can play but don't throw please
are these these seem um seem like good toys for his personality
is this the type of thing that he at home
um he mostly plays with cars and trains at home
those are his favorite
especially trains
so was anything here that he did not even look at was not
um today he did was not interested in books
he normally likes to read books but he was more focused on the food toys
so he he didn't have any interest in the books
and he didn't seem to have an interest in the doll until i brought it over and asked him to feed the doll food and then he lost interest that quick
sheep
look
what else were you doing with the doll
is that do you play with ever does he ever play with
no he doesn't have a doll at home
so that's why i was seeing what he would do with a doll
and he didn't seem to have very much of an interest
cookie
that's right
yeah he didn't seem to have much of an interest in the doll so
that didn't last long
watch out
now how would did you notice any changes with what he played with from the last visits
it's always he's played with the food the hard toys and food first
and then the stuffed animals second
um and then with books being read occasionally he'll flip through 
he probably played with more the books the last time then he did this time
at home do you read books
yes
yes uh
several a night and all throughout the day we read lots of books
yes cuckoo
do you have any of those
um we have a couple of the doctor seuss books like this
we have a couple of the feel books and then we have one or two of these uh peekaboo type the lift flap books
so yeah we have one or two
books
that's right
not the other ones
no i don't have goodnight moon and
no
we don't have
but we do have a couple of the small board doctor doctor suess type books
board books
so you said that he mostly plays with trains
trains and cars
he's obsessed with thomas the train
oh
yeah
thomas
are you giving her peas
are you throwing toys again
so he knows the names of most of those
a lot of 
yeah
i have he knows ice cookies uh toast
and then he'll repeat just about anything
if you ask him to say something he'll say just about anything
so he may not know the name of say like the hamburger
no sir don't touch please
oh yeah you're cute
but you could tell him to say burger and he'll say it
booger
no burger
what is that
cookie
yeah
you think it's real i know
so the stuffed animals do you have those
which of those do you have at home
we um
we don't really have any of the i mean probably don't have any of these stuffed animals at home
but he you know he knows the animals by name and um
like which ones
uh he knows bees from he's got a book that's got a bee in it
he knows that
he knows any of the you know just bird in general
he knows those
and then doggies
bees birds doggy
that's probably it
doggy
but yeah he's more identifying i would say just the things that he knows from books and stuff
thank you
oh it's not an apple that's a pear
pear
so he was able to identify a lot of the well a lot of the food
pear
oh how's that taste
not very good huh
where'd you put the ice
where'd you put it
can you find it
that's a cookie
can you
can you show me where the ice is
you must be gettin hungry
so was there anything else that you noticed that you thought was different
if anything like um surprised you
that he went for or surprised you that he didn't have an interest in
um the books i was surprised he didn't really have an interest in the books
i was was surprised though that when i told him to feed the baby her bottle he grabbed the bottle and gave it to her
that's not something we've done at home
he doesn't have a baby
and he surely doesn't give her her ba a bottle so
why are you throwing toys
that's not nice
thank you
burger
i don't know
my whole thing fell off
i don't know when
okay
i'm actually gonna ask you some questions now
oh okay
um so what did she go to first
what was the first thing
the food
the food
yeah pretty typical of her
she loves food
that was expected
yeah
she yeah she loves
does she have like play food like that at home
yeah
yeah we do
we have a play kitchen so
but she she doesn't have the pasta or the peas
she has the ice which she likes a lot so
but yeah she likes the play food
um yeah
and then she loved the ba the it was interesting because babies we have tons of babydolls at home everybody buys her babydolls and most of the time she doesn't bother with them
but here she did
she was giving him the juice and the bottle
it's interesting because i don't have a bottle for her at home
like none of her babies came with a bottle so i'm thinking maybe that's why she actually liked to play with it
i think she might have to go to technical school
she seems to love the equipment
she loves anything with buttons and
the v c and the cable box and the
no
no
yeah i know you're sleepy
i know
here read your book
do you wanna read your book
yeah
so she was looking at you read her some of the books
she loves to she loves books
that's her
you wan i don't think we're gonna color today
she likes to um read and
no
just look at the pictures and talk about them
she wants to know like like what everything is in them
like for me to label them
that's just the age she's at
oh she's very tired i'm sorry
oh no it's okay i just have a few more
it's her nap time
questions
okay
oh no
no
it's okay it's okay
come here
okay go 
it's alright
it's alright
um so the animals
was she interested in them at all
she was it's it's um i thought she might be we watch word she loves word world
her brother likes it so she watches this
so i thought i've never seen these before
these are really cool
i thought they might be int she might be interested in just because she watches the show
but she didn't care about today
so
yeah but normally she likes she likes little stuffed animals and stuff
but she never has a very long attention span for them
she'll just look at them and kiss them and hug them and then put them down
so that's about it
she really doesn't play play with them yet
does she have any of those same ones
she has she has this pooh bear
um i know she was pooh bear
she has a a poodle that looks exactly like this it's just a little bit bigger
so she saw that one and she liked it
but that's about it
she really doesn't have
she has some puppets at home that's why she was playing with the puppet
but otherwise she doesn't have them
did she have does she have any of those same books
we have goodnight moon
um but we don't have the counting one
um and we have we have put me
and we have a lot of the karen katz books but we don't have this one
but they're all kind of the same
they look the same
so she likes so she's ripped them all apart so
they all have flaps and it's like they
yeah
they get destroyed so
and then anything any other items
that she had
no
nothing el
well just well the kitchen stuff
but she doesn't have a clock yet
she doesn't have that
so no
well i think that's good
okay
first
um
he went right to the baby doll
okay
um
what what do you think interested him um with the baby doll
um he has a baby doll at home
and i think i guess he first like picked this up
i guess he thought is was something to drink out of
and so then we
does he still drink out of something like that
no he drinks out of like a sippy cup
but i guess it's like somewhat similar it has like a straw
okay
so
um what else do you think about the baby was interesting
that it might've interested him
um i think that he could pretend to feed it
he likes to pretend to do things
and he has there's a baby at the daycare where he goes
and so she probably he probably sees her feed the baby a lot
okay
so
um there's something about the baby's foot
oh yeah it has a booboo
okay
little band aid
um what did you play with afterwards
um then i think he picked up the books
but he didn't really wanna be read to
okay
he's been doing that lately where he just like brings us a book and then he won't even like sit still he just wants to flip all the pages and then put it down so
and then after that he went to the ah play food i think
okay
d you have play food at home
we don't
and every time we come like that's what he seems to be most interested in
and i don't know if they have play food at daycare
but i dunno if it's the texture or just he likes food a lot but
he he really likes to play with that
which food items did he did you play with
um the pizza
the bread
the peas
um the peanut butter like the soup containers he liked
he had the hamburger at one point
and the plates and he was like liked to bang things together
and then he was playing with the keys somewhere in there too that's his favorite thing is real keys
he always likes taking our keys
so
um d you think there are food items here that he might recognize from what he's had before
um yeah like the peas
the hamburger he's played with before
um
yeah i think i remember him playing with like the pizza and the hamburger before
um
um
okay what did you play with afterwards
um then i tried to get him to play with the soft toys a little bit
okay
um yeah he picked up like the deer
the groundhog
um this dog which i remember him playing with before
and then i picked up this dog and the frog
um back to the food
i know that you tried to to make a sandwich
yeah
um what kind of sandwiches does he have or has he had
oh yeah at home he usually has um a lot of peanut butter sandwiches
okay
and um like grilled cheese sandwiches
okay
um like um dessert items that he might've been interested in and picked up
um oh the ice cream
yeah but he doesn't really i don't think he's eaten ice cream on a cone before
so
um how breakfast foods
um
normally he eats cereal
okay
but i dunno did you have breakfast foods here
i didn't see oh yeah the waffle he was playing with the waffle a little bit
okay
um
i know he was um using the utensils to himself
oh yeah
ah what utensils has he been using
um he's using uh like a fork and a spoon at home
okay
not very well with either of them
but he tries and we help him a lot
so i think he likes to pretend to use them
okay
um i know that along with preparing a sandwich you were trying to prepare other things
um does he watch you in the kitchen prepare things
um yeah
he's often in the kitchen like when we're making dinner
and i know at daycare he goes to a home daycare
and so i think they help her make lunch
oh okay
so
i think he sees the food preparation a lot
um
back to the book
so what books did you pick up or try to read
um the on the book
he first picked up the the zoo book
okay
and then he went for the on the i think because it has the fuzzy duckling and we have a similar book at home
okay
and he likes to pet the animals
um were there any any play animals that he might've seen before
or does he have at home
um
animals
yeah he's played with this one before when we were here i know that
and then he has animals at home but not necessarily like the same ones
okay
um
yeah
i don't see any like the exact same ones
i'm tryin think what we have at home
we have like a orca that he plays with
and kangaroo
okay
but he doesn't he shows like less interest in the soft toys
than like just picking up books
not like reading them but just kind of like carrying them around and like opening them shutting them that's what he plays with a lot at home
do not put that in your mouth
can you just pretend
that's a hard concept isn't it
yeah
yeah it's not for putting in the mouth it's just pretend
we can pretend to eat
yeah
alrighty well we're all done
um
okay
stop
what ya think allison
what ya think
oh now she likes it
yeah now suddenly we want it
no
so what did she seem most interested in
i think the food
as always
i think she's always interested in the food
why why do you think that is
she has one thing on her mind apparently
i dunno
i think
you guys ask me this every time
i guess because we have so much of it at home
oh alison
not nice
not nice
no baby
no that's not nice
we don't wanna ruin the book okay
they gotta fix it
so do you have like a toy kitchen at home
yeah
and of course you know big sister's always makin food and wantin her to eat it you know
she but she we've been trying to teach her how to pretend eat and she's not gettin that as you can see
you know she puts it all in her mouth
i mean even amanda gets frustrated with it
she's like stop eating it for real
that's not the rules
you know they have it at her preschool
so amanda's a rule follower
and we can't put the food in our mouth at school it's against the rule
so the same rule applies at home and so it drives her crazy that she puts it in her mouth
i'm like she doesn't understand
you didn't understand when you were that age either
she'll get it you know
to her it's food so she just puts it all in
she does the same thing with the baby bottles at home
you know
tries to suck on 
see if she can get anything out
so she likes babydolls though she's a she's a babydoll so she she seemed to like that too
yeah i see you you put clothes on the doll
cookie
we put her shoes didn't we
shoes
yeah you see a cookie
she has lots of dolls at home too
yeah we have lots of dolls
yep
we have a girl we have a girly house
two girls
so yes
lots of dolls
yep
but as always my girls are just not into stuffed animals
we have tons of stuffed animals too and they never touch them
and it was the same thing here i really couldn't get her that interested in stuffed animals
i don't know why
which animals did you try to show her
oh we did the bee
and the frog
and the doggies
get her all the doggies that's her new one of her new words is doggy
doggy right
and we don't even have a doggy at our house
we have a cat but she hasn't said cat yet
yeah we have a kitty cat
and she say no
no
she didn't want any of those
oh i watched her do the beaver
and the zebra
she said no to the zebra
i showed her the zebra
no
what's the matter with the zebra
why don't you like the zebra
i think it's a nice zebra
i don't know
does she like it when you read to her
yeah she does
she likes books
she definitely likes books
we have a ton of those like little ones this size and she walks around with them all the time
pointin to things in and lookin at 
she normally does like when we read books
and you read her the
we read i started this one
and then we did the peekababy
ah
we did we did all of peekababy and we looked at a couple animals on on the
that one
yeah i knew with the touching she she was touching it
she liked how it felt
definitely
but she kept going back to the play food
the plastic food stuff
the plates and the spoons and all she liked right away
right
but it was like some of the words
i was trying to get her to talk some you know as much as i could so you guys could hear her talk
so i that like she knows pizza you know
but i don't know that she's completely made that connection that this is also pizza
you know i was trying to say get me the pizza and she wasn't getting it but the minute i held it pizza she knew it then but she wasn't grabbin it for me
it's a pretty small pizza
so i'm not sure
yeah and she doesn't eat pizza that looks like th with all that stuff on it either so i dunno
you know
i dunno what kind of
she does she won't eat any vegetables so she definitely
oh and she doesn't eat any meat either
she's my vegetarian
she eats like nothing
what kinds of food does she like to eat
junk
cucu cookies
crackers cake candy
all the c right
she don't wanna eat any fruits and vegetables
yogurt
and she's good at breakfast foods though
she'll eat pancakes and stuff
cereal but she uh
yeah and won't eat any meat
no regular fruits and vegetables except the banana
that's about it
and she'll the gerber ones but then
like gerber peaches
but she won't eat like little cans of peaches
i'm like they taste so much better
why do you want that gerber stuff
so how have you noticed her play changing since the last time that she came in here
yeah
yeah
so it's probably changed quite a bit since then
definitely
yeah i think it definitely has yeah
yeah she was more engaged on her own with this stuff
whereas before i was doing a lot of it and showin her and stuff but now she totally knows how to do it herself see
she's
yeah she can feed herself and stuff now i mean for real she even does it so
yeah you look like you're good at that
yeah
say oh yeah
i can eat i just don't eat healthy
nothing healthy
well
is that about all
yeah
yeah that's it
that was great
well that wasn't too bad huh
um so you know how you go over the questions
yeah
yeah
you can keep playin if you want
if you don't freak him out too much he can
yeah
okay i'm just talking to mommy okay
it's alright bud
alright so just kinda talk to me like what was kinda the first thing he played with today
um i think the the waffles
i think was the first thing he played with
he often eats waffles for breakfast and he likes waffles so um i dunno if that's why but that that was the first thing
and he really seemed to like all of the pretend play set
like the ea the foo the kitchen stuff the food stuff and the baby
he liked feeding the baby and um
he was crackin me up too he was wiping hi her mouth with the bib and ever
i mean so like clearly like stuff that he learned watching other people
um and he's definitely still teething so he puts everything in his mouth
huh
um and he liked you know when we sat down and read the books he always likes the books that have the flaps and the textures and everything like that but
um he's a very independent when he plays
so you know when i sit here and do these play sessions with him i feel kinda silly like he often plays by himself
you know and like i'll interact with him and stuff but um you know he does his own thing
so
uh one of the things i think that he probably would have done had there been the opportunity he was definitely playing with the spoons and stuff a lot is he loves having a spoon and a bowl and just stirring
so that was i think he wa he almost seemed like he was looking for a bowl that he could stir something in there were like a million spoons and no bowls
or pots or anything like that
right
hey
we're not leaving
come on
and you don't get to take that with you anyway
wanna come look at some of these toys
so um he was not at all interested in the stuffed animals
which is not surprising he never ever is
like he's never had like a lovey or a cuddly any nothing so
does he have any stuffed animals at home or
we have a couple but he doesn't play with them
like he has this one bunny that once in a while he'll hold onto
but like he's not attached to it you know
like some kids like have to have their whatever to go to bed like
his his is his pacifier
that's the only thing he can
which is he's getting out now
are you gonna get your pass
you can
go 
he can open himself
yep
yeah he di he really um i mean here and typically he really likes playing with stuff that's like what mom and dad use
that you know what i me like he watches adults like crazy
and um you know and he wants to play with the real pots and pans and the plastic containers and you know like forget this toy stuff
so
he's over that
yeah
but he ju i mean he really does
he like he wants to be like the grown ups
can you get it buddy
do you want mom to help
oh
i thought there was in there i don't know where it went
sorry
so
so with the books did he does he have any of those books at home or anything like that
yeah he has similar ones at home
the he has actually the rest of this series i think
this is like the only one i haven't ever that we don't have i think
that i've seen that we don't have
um and he's got lots of things with the touch and feel
he loves that
he loves um and any of the board books he likes to turn the pages
and sometimes he'll decide halfway through the book that he's done and he'll grab the back of the book and close it and say byebye
but not alwa i mean sometimes he likes to sit and listen to the whole book
but i mean some very frequently he'll byebye
and he closes the book
but the board books he likes turning the pages
okay so he'd never seen that book before
no
and there are other books in the series though
yeah there's a whole bun there's like peekaboo and where's_your_belly and i dunno
but it's the same author and it's the same kind of kid and the same kind of flaps
i mean as far as he's concerned it i don't know it might be the same book to him but
it's very similar to the ones we've got at home
okay
um so were there any toys you kinda talked about it a little bit but any toys that he usually plays with at home that you didn't see here
um yeah probably like a bowl
i mean just looking at like when he was playing with the spoons and stuff
and then he also loves to play with little people
the fisher price little people
and and um he's got cars
and like they're um like chuck the truck or something like plastic cars and he likes to zoom around once in a while
those would be the two big things i would say that he likes to play with at home that is not here
that are not here
um but yeah he's been especially he's really gotten into the little people lately
we just got a christmas set somebody gave to us and he's like going nuts over it
and he loves those things that um
there's no noisy toys here
he loves to push buttons and hear noises
like he loves those kind of toys
and he'll just push the same button over and over and over again
so
depending on if it's something he likes
huh
like part of the little people play set there's like a lamp post and there's a little platform and you push it down
the bell there's bells that ring and then it plays deck the halls
and he'll sit there and do it over and over again
and he'll dance and clap when deck the halls comes on and so
and then and i guess just music
i mean i guess that's not like a toy but he loves to dance and clap and
and um he's got you know like a magnet thing at home that he pushes the button and it plays a song and he'll dance in the kit dance around the kitchen you know so
um that's i think one of his other favorite things to play
so
i guess i mean you talked about how he doesn't really have animals were there any other toys here that he doesn't really have at home
he doesn't really have the kitchen stuff at ho
i mean at least the play kitchen stuff
like we've got i mean he'll play with our stuff in the kitchen like he'll pull out the pots and pans and the wooden spoons and whatever and he'll play with that
but he doesn't really have pretend food
and so i'm try i don't know if he does at daycare or not
but at home he doesn't
um and that that was one of the things we actually were talking about getting him for christmas so um he might soon but
he he that was all he was really interested in playing with before when we came and i think it was more because it was like plastic things he could chew on and now he's like actually interested in it um it seems
more as like oh this looks like food that i eat
you know and he actually wants to play with it like as a pretend food thing
right
instead of just like oh this is something i can chew on
so yeah you said he has waffles um any other foods that he actually eats that he may have saw here
well i was crackin up he was biting on the hamburger and he won't he's like suddenly a vegetarian recently
so i don't know what that was about
i mean he has eaten hamburgers
um pizza he'll eat pizza but he didn't really play with the pizza
i don't know that he saw that and recognized it as pizza
um and he loves cheese
but he didn't really play with that either
i mean some of it was that he just never really made it past the pile the first pile that he started playing with so
what no
we're not playing with that it's not a toy
but ice he loves ice
my gosh
i don't know how he didn't turn into ice this summer
mommy and daddy are suckers
and he loves to drink milk and juice
and i mean he loves to drink so
the sippy were like
and normally he's got real ones of those so he was probably a little bit frustrated
hey
no
no
yeah you wanna put hand sanitizer on don't you
here why don't you come over here
sit by mom
that's not a toy
not a toy
not a toy
he did a good job
he was you can definitely tell he likes to play pretty independently but
yeah
yeah and he'll well he'll play with if he loves other kids
it's so funny
he loves other kids and he'll play with other kids
but he's totally fine playing on his own too
i mean he's alway always has been
and like we'll i mean since he was little we would try to sit down and play with him and we always felt kinda useless he had his thing going on you know
and there were times that i would say like hey look at this or try it this way and he was completely oblivious to what i was saying he was focused
so um
me
no
you may not play with that
come here
get over here
we can turn this off
he did a great job today
he was really interested in a lot of different things
say thanks
say thanks
can you say thank you
not today
that's okay
are we done with this
yep
i have a couple questions for you
sure
and we're all set
so could you walk me through your play session as to what she played with
um i guess when we first sat down she kinda gravitated toward the baby
and then um i think she picked up the sheep too but she didn't really find that interesting
but she definitely liked the baby
we fed the baby a lot of pizza
and a lot of bottle or sippy and some ice
um she definitely liked you know using a spoon and like pretending to be a mommy and everything like that
we did read one book
um we have this book at home
so i think she recognized
we have the exact same book
which book was it
it this was the karen katz peekababy book
so i thought she would kinda like that that's why i kinda picked it out
i kinda encouraged her to use that one
um she looked at a few of the beanie babies like the zebra and the dog but then she went back to baby and we basically were just kinda playin with all the food and the baby
that's basically about it
what does she usually play with at home
um she does like babies
but i would have to say that she normally doesn't concentrate on them quite so exclusively
um she has an older brother and so she kinda does what he does
you know what i mean
so but she does like to push her stroller
she has a stroller and she likes to like feed the baby the bottle and push the stroller
um what kinda stuff was she not interested in
um well she wasn't i mean she didn't she played a little bit with the beanie babies but not too much
and then i mean really the book
i was the one who i mean i i basically picked out this book and kinda started reading it to her
so she wasn't really into the books
as much
but she loves books at home so
this is a dog
yeah like the difference
oh you like that baby
besides the pizza
she liked the ice
um she liked the ice and she seemed to be interested in the waffle
and she liked the box of taco shells
and of course
most kids actually don't like that box
really
i mean it doesn't look at all like what it is so
i could understand that
and then and the bottle itself
were you surprised by what she did
not really
um i was surprised that she didn't pick up more books i guess
but she does like to play with babies but not quite so long maybe
and i guess she played with the clock too
alright i think we're good then
alright great
let's see lexie
can you say thank you
thanks
now we have to go
there's just so many distractions here
she'll come back
come on
he's like the chair spins
um he played with the food
i don't remember which food he played with
he had the spoon
and he had i think one of the i think the bottle is what he had first
but yeah he was all about food this time
the spoon the peanut the pizzas the waffles the bread the bottle
the sippy
the hamburger
he's all about food this time
do you think recognizes these food items
i think so because those are what went in his mouth
so
waffles what are what he usually has for breakfast
and the peanut kinda surprises me because that is what he has for lunch
so
but then he walked around with the chicken for awhile
what other toys did you play with
well i tried to get him to play with the sheep and the zebra
um both of them and that didn't work
and the books and that he sat down and looked at the peekaboo one for a minute and then he didn't uh he put that down
and then he saw the c chairs and the computers
were there any other books that you tried to read to him
the uh on the and i i let him look at the books
i don't necessarily read because he gets really i dunno frustrated if i try to start reading
can i have it
ah joe
thank you joe
um but i usually just let him uh wa look at the books on his own especially if they're just board books
to kinda get used to the idea of looking
so
joseph
i know it spins and that's more fun
but come back over here
did you notice any um similarities or any difference between um toys he might be interested in from past visits or not interested in
no
i think the last time we were here it was food
the last time also
he doesn't it's funny though because he has at home um in his crib at least he plays with stuffed animals
that's usually what i leave in there
and so he plays with that
but he also has um musical toys
that he likes
he likes noise
so
he likes noise to make it and that's the beating of the spoon and the peanut
that was that's something he he has a drum at home
so
you're silly
um what did you think of these toys that you can sort of take apart the letters and
i love 
i love these toys
i think they're great
and he he sat and watched me take apart
but i don't think he quite understood that they would go back together
even though i showed him
so but yeah i love those
do you think he um recognizes these animals or the words specifically
um i don't
i don't think he does recognize 
we we we go online to starfall dot com and we go through all the letters periodically throughout week
and i think he's starting to kinda get it
um his vocabulary is a lo a lot wider than his uh talking
he knows a lot of words but he doesn't say much
so so we'll ask him to close things or go get something and usually he can do it pretty well
joe
the keyboard is not for you
it really
i know
that's what we do at home but it's really not for you
yes that's the mouse and that's not for you either
come on
he's like i'm a big kid i'm like my brothers
ice cones
has he had and ice cone
not on a cone
but he has had ice before
but he did pick up the ice cones too
is there anything here that you think he um might not have seen before
i don't think so
most of this is is here when we come
and so and then like the food
sorry every chair every computer
did you find it
whoops
did you fall off
that's normal too
um but no
i mean he's seen stuffed animals before
um not necessarily like otters and stuff but
he's seen frogs and birds and he now has a kangaroo at home
um so it's they're ones he's seen before
um what about the doll
the doll
just when we come here
since he only has brothers we don't have dolls in the house
huh
yes i see you found another one
have you practiced um telling time
no
but he likes to play with my watch
and he's seen clocks
around the house and stuff so
joe
i think we're all done
okay
um is this okay if i ask you a couple of questions about what you were playing with
sure
okay
so um well any toys that he played with this time more than he did last time or
um not really
he i mean he likes the we have the play food at home so he likes that and he likes the stuffed animals
it's okay i have my eye on him
okay
um he's not interes he wasn't really interested in the books sometimes he's a little more interested in the books
but he seemed to play he likes the uh like the baby bottle and the fake juice
what are you doing
yeah get out of there
oh peekaboo i see you
you get of there
silly you
so what sorts of things do you think were like his favorite
um he likes the animals
um but he also likes the play he likes the play foo
i don't know which one he likes better
probably the animals
okay
like he recognizes some of them does he have toys like that at home
um he has zebras at home like these little noah's ark set
and he recognizes pooh
um and then he knows dogs but he doesn't have any of those type of dogs at home
and the the geese we feed the geese
so he was trying to give the geese bread
where's the baby
so is he like learning the names of
um he more it's like the sounds he seems to be getting more
oh okay
like when he sees a cow he goes moo or a dog he well he says dog we have a dog so he says doggy he sa he barks too
but like a cat he'll meow
so it's more like he knows more of the sounds that the animals make as opposed to their names
okay
and are there any of the foods that he seemed interested in
uh he liked the spaghetti
and he likes the baby bottle and the sippy cup
does he eat things like that at home
yeah
yeah
okay
are there any foods that um he played with or does he have pretend food at home
yes
he has a gril he has like the burgers he has a grill with play food
so he doesn't have all the same play food but he does have play food
how do you guys play with the food at home
um he'll make us things on the grill and bring us like usually it's not like a complete bur it's just the burger and then maybe a bun later you know or the piece of lettuce
so he'll put them on the grill and then he'll he'll bring to you
he serves you
yes
was there a different way that he was a he used the food today in here
um feeding the baby was different
i mean he'll sometimes give it to his like he has the sesame street characters he'll give them stuff
we don't have like a baby doll
so that was differen that was different
how the uh food he was picking or even you were picking to play with
were they
they were different than what we have
okay
like the peas and the ice cone and the pizza we don't have that at home
okay
are those foods that he's familiar with uh hearing the names of or
yes
yes
no you're not going in there
come here look at all these toys
i know come here
look at this book
no
okay
do you have um books at home like these
yes
yes yes
we have something like this we have goodnight moon not this one but the original
we have a lot of board books
okay
did he play with the doll
baby
where's the baby
where's the baby
oh is that the baby's shoe
can you go give that to the baby
so you said he doesn't have a doll at home
so this is uh well i mean except for when he's played here
right
um how did was there anything that you thought that was like new on how he played with the doll or
um not really he'll do the same thing like to st to his sesame street characters
feed them and he doesn't dress them thought they don't have they don't have clothes
how different things that um how you played with him with the doll
um i guess having him try and put the shoe that would be different we haven't done that before
i mean we try and put our own shoes on
do you label do you use his body usually to label parts
yes
yeah
i mean sometimes i'll ask him like about like the sesame characters where's their nose and that kind of stuff
but usually it's either me or him that we label the nose and ears and that kind of stuff
and then um you said the books i know they're the same books but any that were you found more familiar or you were more drawn to or thought that he would like more
well he likes goodnight moon so that's why i i picked up that one
is that the baby's
is he getting into doctor seuss at all at home or
um not we haven't i mean we have some doctor seuss books and for doctor seuss' birthday we read doctor seuss books but he doesn't seem to pick those out
right now he his favorite is he likes um click clack and goodnight moon and then there's like these little sesame street ones he's really into sesame street so
um he picks those out right now as the ones we keep reading
does that go on her foot
ooh which one are you gonna put on
that one
so what toys do you think he was like the least interested in
the least interested in
i guess he played most with the baby and then the stuffed animals so
he really didn't interact with the books this time
and then i would say the books the least and then the play food
okay
so the play food was in the bottom
um i would say it was
i'm trying to think like time wise how much time we spent
probably s yeah
i mean the books i think were at the bottom and then the play food and then the baby and then the stuffed animals
were there foods that he was unfamiliar with
um no i think he knows i mean you know he wouldn't know what these these boxes
you know when i said tacos i mean he's seen these we've had those before but not as frequently as um maybe the peas or the spaghetti
she have a booboo
does he know what that is if you if you say that like bandaid and
no he's never had one be i mean he has them all over the place but he's never gotten a bandaid
okay
um i think he's seen them probably at daycare on people but we don't really talk about it
shoe
so do you find that he's rep
repeating a lot more or um or that he's like spontaneously labeling like the items in the room
um i he he likes to repeat like he'll bring things to you he wants you to tell him what they are say what they are
and then but he'll if you just like listen to him chatter he'll talk about what they are to himself
like if i'm doing the dishes or whatever and he's playing
so he labels but he also wants to know what the labels are
did he find was there anything that he brought to you in this group of toys that he uh wanted a label for
um the only thing i can think is this taco
yeah tacos
for me
oh thank you
do you think there are any new words that he was saying um or like the first time he kinda said them and you weren't sure what it was but he had maybe he had the object in his hand
you mean today or ever
today
today
um not really
yeah there wasn't anything really there wasn't anything new
okay and is he he's eating well he's probably eating like bits and pieces of everything
yeah
yes
is he feeding himself
yes
yes
he's using all utensils
yes
cool
not effectively but we're using 
is that how he was feeding the baby
yes
oh you gonna give her some spaghetti
or are you gonna eat it
is that for the baby
oh no
it fell
i think that's it for our questions
do you have any other ones
um
what happened
oh that's gonna be hard buddy i dunno how to te help you out with that one
um i think that's it with the questions
now the the questionnaire that was sent with it he he tore off some of the pages so i don't have the complete thing so i didn't do anything i don't know if you want me to give me a complete one i can fill out and mail back or do you need that
yeah we can give you a complete one with a self addressed and stamped envelope
yeah
yeah he got to it and just ripped apart like the back half of it
no problem just drop it in the mail as soon as you can
okay
okay yeah
if you can fill it out between like today and the next few days that'd be great
yeah that'd be fine
yeah
does it have to be in pencil it said in pencil
uh no it doesn't have to be in pencil
that's if we were using a scantron and we're not going to
okay no because i was saying i was like i don't think i've ever filled any of them in pencil
can i ask you some questions
um so ah tell me how you guys played today and what you played with
uh mostly with real things
well toy real things
the spoon
um one of the first things she picked up was a sippy cup
which is what she drinks with most of the time the time just a regular cup
um and then she's learning to feed herself so the spoon is what she played with the most
and then plates
and it seemed like everything that was food related she did
try to use the spoon to pick it up or she asked me to open a bottle
that was most of the stuff
i engaged with the book but she wasn't that interested today she had too many other competing toys
um
that was it mostly and then i initiated i think i initiated the thing with the doll
i'm oh no she found the baby's shoe was off
oh
so she tried to put the shoe on her foot i think
out ya mouth
uh yeah
um what about the does she read books at or do you read books to her at home
yeah
but usually um it's just a book and no other toys so we usually can go through
the entire book
but we had to stop a couple a times
and usually she'll want to read the book again after we read it
but it's not that's not happenin today
uh what made you think that the books that you picked up she would like
um these books um at first i thought the words would be big but when i opened it i saw it was really small
she got disengaged really quick
but usually the ones with like big words she'll usually follow along with those
but this one um she has one similar to it and it has the flip
parts to it
and so she's a little bit more engaged in these than the ones with the really small words
d you play um that game with her
the book yeah
yeah
it's it's a slightly different one
um it's by karen cassiswell
oh um one with potty training
and one is called um where's_baby's_belly_button
but you read one part and then they flip it open and see the answer or whatever
but yeah we do that one too
she enjoys that
yeah
okay
d you still play um d you still play like peek a with her at home like without a book
not as much anymore
we use to all the time
but and really if you say that p word she'll do it
oh
so you hafta react
like she'll close her eyes for you to say oh there you are
oh i thought i triggered the game
is she pretty incessant about it when she
yeah she likes it a lot
she likes it a lot
was she saying it with that
with that book
no because no
she just likes the reaction when she hides her face and shows it
she likes for you to act surprised like oh my gosh i was looking for you there you are
and d you think she likes the rhyming in either of the books
i don't even know if she notices the rhyming
i don't i think i go so slow or sporadically that you don't even realize i i've rhymed
usually i'm describing things in the book so i never end up rhyming
usually i don't
like usually if i were were to go through the book um i would read this side and then i'd ask you know what is this and then by the time we open it where are her eyes where's her mouth where's her nose etcetera
so i don't even know if she notices that
the book is rhyming
cause of all the extras i'm throwing in
so you ask her like a lot of questions when you're playing
yeah the picture
and then we also have the um your baby
so usually i show her the word
she only knows how read a few words but
um and then we open it
and then i ask her something about that question
and that doesn't rhyme at all
yeah
right
um
d you have other doctor seuss books at home
actually really i can not really i don't think we have any doctor seuss books
for her yet
um yeah
no doctor seuss books
i'm surprised now that you say that
that's the first one she got to read
right
um have you does she know her you were saying that you ask her questions like where's um the facial features but does she know her other body parts
michaela where's ya toes
watch it's not gonna oh okay
eh it's not gonna work cause i'm i'm tryin show her off
but yeah toes feet knees stomach arm hands
you're playing so nicely
uh hair
yeah
i see that i see that
what do ya gonna eat
what do ya gonna go eat
you gonna go eat a waffle
you're gonna play with me
are you gonna talk
you gon be shy
shy baby
she's a shy baby
you're just
just smiling huh
yeah
um so about does she play with dolls at home
not really
and it's actually because of this study that i actually got one
and she hardly plays with it
we i dunno
i guess we never thought to get one and i guess maybe by the time we thought to get one she wasn't interested or maybe she'll be interested later but not really
ooh gotta change your diaper honey
how did you play with the doll today
how did you guys interact with it
um kinda how when we did play with the one at home where's her eyes nose or something like that
the only thing different was that um she wanted to try to put the doll's shoe on
where as at home nothing comes off
okay
the doll so there's no you know parts she can put in her mouth
that's cool
uh and then what about the food what were what were how did you guys play with the food um
and like what foods did you find she was enjoying more were
the sippy cup and the bottle so the juice
the spoons for sure
like most of the dishes
um she had the applesauce but i'm not certain she knows what this is
i saw her pick up the pizza and try to eat it but we don't really eat pizza at home
uh i had the peas and spaghetti but i picked those up
um but it seems like she's mostly playing with things that she recognize
the juice spoon plate
mostly
okay now that i said that of course she picks up the ice cream
you're funny
did you play at all with any of the stuffed animals or any of the animals
she didn't pick any of up
and i didn't initiate it either
can you think of anything else that you may have like even if you you played with the food but you also um like elaborated and played with them in different ways than the traditional
um oh well there were three plates so um i just incor kinda incorporated numbers like one plate two plate three plate
um we haven't really taught her numbers
i haven't actually tried too much but
just as it randomly comes about
we'll we'll throw numbers into something
but not as intentional as it is that we try to um teach her words or you know use a book or something
but that's the only other other thing that i think i did
oh or the um feed the baby the bottle
out ya mouth
feed the baby the bottle
i think i didn't mention that
are there different ways that she knows that like um what she's doing when you're playing you know what she's doing like you approve of like yeah lets play this way lets change the way we're playing those different ways
um yeah like maybe with her puttin
i think she kinda knows they're toys but she kinda knows they're food so she keeps puttin it in her mouth so
that's the easy part i could say out your mouth and she'll know
um but usually if she's doing something the right way or well then i'll try to encourage her
and if she's not then you know then she can just play
opposed um i hardly have to tell her no or don't do that um with playing
and when she puts something in her mouth i can specifically say out ya mouth and she knows
um what we're doing but
that's it usually she's doing something well i encourage it
uhoh
and how like scripts like you know when you're playing you kind of like role play you kinda get like into the do find that you do that h here or in at home as well
um lets see
you kinda get into the pretend role so you like add not dialogue but like answer pretend pretend play you know
um maybe she has a pretend kitchen at home so sometimes i pretend like we're cooking
so um we might i dunno i need think
i guess i wouldn't really qualify
cause we pretend like we're cooking food and washin dishes and putting things in the fridge
so you know i'll tell h her where are the eggs we put in the refrigerator before they go bad
and she'll look for the eggs and then she knows and the egg is a circle so
she has to put the egg in a circular opening to put it in the 
um that might be the closest to a script um
yeah there's a play laptop that we have at but my husband plays more with her than i do what else do we have
yeah as far as something coming close to a script maybe the play kitchen
cause there cert you know there's certain things you hafta do so
you end up sayin the same thing
i think there's only so much you can say about a and an egg so
i guess that's the closest we have to a script
okay
okay cause you know today you're playing with like the plates and you're feeding each other so i thought maybe some
oh
oh i s well yeah um
and this is actually this is very recent where she'll usually have her sippy cup
and she'll pretend to feed me and i'll pretend like i'm drinkin then i'll say thank you
and then if i do the same thing she's supposed to say thank you if i pret you know feed her something
um yeah
i think the yeah
that and that's very recent like within the last couple of weeks where she'll pretend to feed us or you know food or something like that
okay
and so she'll feed us and she'll expect us to say thank you
and then we do the same thing in reverse
out ya mouth
out ya mouth
so um
i forgot what i was gonna ask i'm sorry
uh so these scripts that you were saying these scripts were new
out ya mouth
um and then you do oh i was gonna say so um when you ask her to say things does she repeat back usually
usually
yeah
and then that's how i figure out what words you know she can say cause otherwise sometimes i think it just won't even come up
and then we won't even know
so and i'll even pick random things like microphone
i think i tried to see if if she could try to say microphone
her mouth opened but it wasn't happenin
no
come back
is she um are you teaching her to potty train or just like
we're about yeah kinda sorta
i first have to figure out how to potty train and then we'll teach her how
um but i think i've stepped off cause usually she'll tell me when she hasta use the bathroom or something beforehand but then i realize she was doin it and i you know she didn't say it
i didn't wanna put it too much on the video
are you boobooing
but otherwise i wouldn't i would normally emphasize like while she's doing it
so that she'll you know start to tell me when she has to
and then maybe i can throw her on the potty beforehand
i'm not sure how i'm supposed to do it i'll figure it out sooner or later
she's only a year and a half so
exactly
from what i hear i have time
exactly
yeah
but um for a while she was really good at lettin us know when she had to do it just before she would do it
wow
yeah but i i guess i didn't stay on top of it because now sometimes it's only sometimes that it happens
well you know when things are new they're so excited to like tell you about it you know what i mean
that's probably what it is yeah
that's probably what it is
yeah
um can you tell me any differences that you noticed on how you played or what you played with from the last time when she was a lot younger
um last time i think i remember her playing with things that were brightly colored
if i remember right
it was like she would play with yellow stuff or orange stuff something really based on color more so
and then today it seems like she plays with things that she recognized
the shoes the plates the spoons the juice the juice in the bottle etcetera
she hardly played with any of the stuff animals but she doesn't really play with the stuff animals at home either
um what else do i remember last time
i think she played a little bit more with the doll last one of these visits
but today def uh i don't think she played with dishes at all last time
at all right
so to it seemed more like things she recognized and definitely towards what she's learning which is how to feed herself
it seems to be what she's playing with now
that's interesting
alright well i think that's all the questions i have unless you wanna add any other um differences or anything that was interesting that you saw in playing today
um not much usually if i'm playing with her we only have a few toys
that's the only thing different
when she's allowed to play with herself she can just go for it
it's only different it doesn't open it's a toy
that was her sayin help
aw
ooh gotta change your diaper honey
alright
stink
yes
yes
alright well lets get you outta here then
thank you for comin
say thank you
oh you're welcome
today
um anything he could teeth on
um the sippy the bottle the spoons
he was kind of interested in the baby and the animals but really and feeding the animals and the baby
no he actually
oh sorry
this is falling apart
um maybe he is hungry i dunno
he hasn't eaten in a few hours
so you've done a play session before right
did he play with anything different this time
um i recall that he was always teething on things so that hasn't changed
um but it was it was um encouraging for me to see him pretending to feed the baby and interacting more with in a pretend way with the stuffed animals and the baby
um before he kind of wasn't super interested in the animals or the baby so
it's nice to see that he's getting into that
i mean at home he's like all about balls and trucks
um and there aren't any of those here
so um
yeah there aren't any of those here
so uh it's nice to see him
we do have a few like stuffed animals that he'll rock or you know do that with but he's he always chooses the trucks and the balls at home even though we have a variety of toys so
um
did he like any of the animals in particular
um i dunno i was trying he we have a dog at home and he's kind obsessed with dogs so i thought he might take more interest than he did in the dogs
um i don't really think
um he liked the zebra
um which is funny sometimes i think he confuses zebras and horses so
um yeah i guess the zebra was one thing he did pick out
is there anything here that he might have something similar to
he has a bigger version of this winnie the at home
um in terms of stuffed animals
um we have a book that's sort of li i don't think it's it's baby animals
it's the same um thing in the series i guess it's different than this book
um and we have some karen katz but we don't have that one
um and we don't have any pretend food at home
does he like when you read to him
do you do that a lot or
yeah we do it a lot
we um we do it always before he sleeps bedtime and naptime but also throughout the day i have a bookcase that just has books so he will grab whatever he wants to read and bring it over and just plop
he'll sometimes he likes to throw the book in my lap
or in his dad's lap and then just like back into our laps like here i wanna read this and then he'll sit down and relax
so yeah he likes to read
does he have any food that her played with that he might have at home that you might eat or
no food is tricky with us because he has a lot of um food sensitivities or it's not allergies i guess there's they're they're just calling it a sensitivity that he might grow out of
so um like we don't have pizza at home because he can't eat it
um he has a lot of issues so
um he
yeah
he probably wouldn't really recognize a lot of the stuff
unfortunately
does he hold like utensils at home
yeah
like that
um mainl we don't give him forks a lot of the time but it's spoons and bowls yeah
does he have anything like stuff over there
the baby dolls
um he doesn't have a baby doll like this he has some um stuffed animal like um uh he has stuffed animals and then like a stuffed doll like a little um race driver race car driver kind of thing
um and like i said i'm always trying to get him to play with
i don't want him to be like stereotypically boy car ball obsessed but that is kind of the way it's happening
um so yeah i'll try to like okay rock the baby burp the baby feed the baby and that kind of thing but he's kind of a little bit more interested in other things
he has
oh the other things he has that are kind of like um babies are little sesame street characters that i like wrap up in blankets and you know show him like that how to nurture a baby
does he have maybe like a favorite color that he kind of seemed to find some stuff that was the same color or anything like that
i hadn't thought of that
um no i um
no that didn't really occur to me
um favorite colors at this age
yeah
just a thought
um yeah i don't i don't think so
i wasn't necessarily paying attention to that
um i have started to um
bless you
um he'll i'll give him crayons now and again and i'll try to you know this is red blue green whatever
and point out like on his trucks which color you know the different trucks are
um but i don't think that he has a favorite color yet
we're gonna have to have some trucks next time
yeah
yeah
alright well i think that's all the questions we have
thank you for playing so well with him today we appreciate it
sure
sure
i'm glad we didn't mess your schedule up being late
sorry about that
no no we're all here
you guys did a great job
okay
to see this like dialogue between like an eighteen month old and the mother
never
not usually it's pretty rare
more so with like a twenty four month old and the mother
um but you guys did a great job that's why i was like giggling
she's wild
um because like you could understand exactly what she was saying and you were like talking back and forth it was like a real conversation going on
so whoever is like transcribing this is gonna like be thrilled
i just have a few questions
no she's hilarious
um what did you all play with first
um she played with the food
the pizza and um mainly the pizza and the um what she calls an ice
they eat ice more than ice michael's allergic to ice
okay
so most of the time when she sees she now calls it a ice
she used to call it ice but they eat ice or popsicles so much now hat she just refers to it all as one thing now
thanks i'll hold on to that
kayla you stinky stink
um what else did she play with after that
um she played with this she thought it was a dragon which in all reality it does look like a dragon
it definitely doesn't look like a sheep now that i think about it
she played with the baby
okay
um she played with most of the food um
what other food items
the bread
okay
the spoons
that was it for the food this time
oh the spaghetti
okay
the bee
and i think the dog there was some dog over here
okay
i don't even see it
oh
um were there other items that she was playing with that she didn't play with before
um i think she played with i think she's more active this time around
she used to she would play you know she'd just pick up something if she knew what it was but
she played with mostly the food
pizza for some reason they love i don't know why
um i can't remember it's been so while since i've been here
i think the last time we were here i read her a book
a story
okay
did you try reading her a book this time
yeah she wasn't interested she was interested in putting the shoes on the baby
okay
by herself
um
which is hilarious
i think we played with the zebras and the otters and the
okay
that's what we played with last time
this time she wasn't so much interested in the stuffed animals except for the baby and her ice and spoon
that's what she interested now
see
besides the ice and pizza are there items that you think she she does recognize
she recognizes mostly like she knows what a teddy bear is she knows what a dog is she knows what a bird is
um i don't even know what half of these animals are so
she knows this is probably a horse i know it's a donkey
yeah
um she knows what a frog is
she knows most of the food items
um she probably don't know what corn is i don't cook it that much
but she know what peas are
i cook it but i always mix it with mixed vegetables so
if she don't know what corn is that's her problem
and let's see that's about it i don't know what this other stuff is
she thought this was um oh she played with the waffles thinkin it was something
she knows what a cookie is
okay
and what else
i think that's it
okay awesome thank you so much
she knows a lot of things
oh am i done
can i ask a couple of questions about your
sure
um so do you mind just like walking me through the session and what he played with and everything
he mostly gravitated towards the food items
um we have that stuff at home so i think maybe he's familiar with it and maybe that's why
um him and his brother play with kitchen and food items a lot
yeah
um do you think he knows any of these foods or
he may
um i talk i try to talk to him as i give him new items and try to explain what they are
so it's hard to say
you know if he's
i know that they comprehend it but i don't you know i don't know to what extent he can put the two together yet
which of these foods do you have at home
spaghetti pizza peas ice waffles so i'm sure those were familiar to him
yeah
i was surprised he was able to figure out to put the waffle on the plate
that's funny
does he eat anything or
you mean
like eat any of these like does he try them at the table or
yes
he has had them all at one point or another
yes
yeah
that's cool
um do we what about any of the other toys that captured his interest or that he might know the name for or
um he didn't seem to be interested at all in the babydoll stuff and that's probably because with two boys at home we don't have any of that at our house
yeah
um so he didn't even gravitate towards that
he seemed interested in the book but you know that didn't last but a couple seconds
um does he eat um do you read to him at home or anything
yes we do read at home
okay
so
his attention span doesn't last
luke
sorry it's the light
come here buddy
he's very uh inquisitive
come here
do you think he knows the names for any of these animals or
he may
um he hasn't actually verbally said a lot of them but we sing songs like um that have this the animal sounds in them so
he may but he didn't seem too interested i was surprised before he seemed to gravitate towards some of the animals but this time he didn't
do you think he sees any of them on tv or
he should notice these we watch this show all the time
word world so
um he just didn't i'm surprised he didn't notice them this time he didn't last time we were here but
yeah
um do you think there's any toy that
i dunno like what are other differences you noticed between like this session and previous sessions with what he's been interested in or
this time i didn't have to en get him engaged as much he was able to just reach and play for things i think it's just at that he's at that age now where he's not afraid to go explore on his own
before he was v and he now he's more mobile which is a lot different too
yeah
um before he didn't get up and walk around so he was very limited to what he did
do does him does he and his brother play at home a lot too
yes
what kinda toys do they play with
um they have kitchen stuff they have cars um they have um tons of books um
they have other toys that you know you can engage where they talk when you put a ball in
you know all those kinda toys so
there ve definitely not limited in their toy selection
yeah
that's cool though
um is there anything else you think we should know or
luke can you leave that there
no there's nothing um he's just starting to babble more so i'm sure he's gonna start spitting out words soon so
that's probably the only difference recently too
cool
well that's all i have for you
sorry about the the uh the older brother today
oh no it's no problem
okay good job
um just have a few questions for you all
sure
um what did you guys play with first
she went right for the pizza
the food
okay
um what did you all play with after that
after all the food in general or just after the pizza
or after what ever items
she went pizza i think cookie
pizza cookie
then what we do
spoons
and we did some music
right
did you make music
make mommy copy you
be careful
be come here samantha
come sit with mommy
let's not climb on that chair
so we did some music
and some books
you gonna climb up gently
there you go
almost
oh she'll get it
it just makes everybody very nervous
yay
yay now what
what else did we play with
we played with the dolly
right
did you put her shoes on
dolly
and a little bit of the stuffed animals
but mostly a lot of food
we kept coming back to the food again
okay
which is her pattern
were these items um that she played with before
yes
the food has always been a fascination of hers here
do you have food objects at home
we do now
for her first birthday we bought 
yay
yay
but they're different
they're different than your food
um but yes we mommy said after all the playing here she does we had to get her some food
so
what about the stuffed animals
does she have any of these at home
none of these
other stuffed animals but none similar to the ones that are here
which ones do you think she recognizes
um i would ha said the winnie the
we have him but she didn't grab it
and looked like she knew what the sheep was but i think i was just making up my own little interpretation
other than that i think that's it
do you think there's stuffed animals that she doesn't know yet
absolutely
the fox like recognize what the animals are
probably the majority of them
okay
i think maybe has seen a zebra
don't know if she places it
um in terms of the books um did you all read those last time
uh no
i don't think we did
i think i tried to but she was having none of it last time if i remember correctly
okay
um do you have similar books at home
yes
yes
which ones
um well she didn't play with that one but we do have put me in the
but the bigger version
goodnight moon but i don't think we read it at home
we have another karen katz book but not that one
so she's similar to finding things
do you think she knows that game have you played that with her before
the peekaboo baby books
yeah
she definitely we have a lot of books at home that have flaps and
um so opening and closing
i think there was like one other one
the foot
that is not one we have
okay
um were you surprised by anything this time
um i was surprise well was i surprised
by anything that she might have picked up
i was gonna say the books but i mean then not really we she reads them at home a lot with her brothers
it's a nightly routine
so i'm not so surprised that she did go to them
um no
i expected her to go to the food first and she did
okay
yeah
great
and you all did a great job
yay
yay you
can mommy take off the mic
yeah
see
now would you like to see what it is
i'm gonna talk to miss jennifer
do you wanna play with the baby or animals
you're cookin
alright
so what did she go for first
uh she went for the animals
does she like playing with animals
yeah
yeah she likes she likes lots of animal i mean she likes animals in general
but then when we go at home she li she always goes for one of her animal toys we have and
at the um store she likes finding like all the little animal figures a lot so
um so which which of these do you think she's seen before
um she's actually probably seen a lot of them before
um we have a lot of we have a lot of these little books um that have a really big variety of animals in them
so she's seen a lot of them in books
um in real life
not that many so
but um but like the moose like we were just at my husband's cousin's house and his house is decorated with moose
so she was sayin moose all weekend so um
and she sees like zebra and like the lemur she saw like it was in one of the books she's been seeing lately
so the particular book it's like it's by uh natural wildlife federation so it's like all about like wild animals so it's it comes in the mail so it's like a series of books so she sees lots of different animals
baby
ice
so yeah
she always likes her she likes playing with the animals usually a lot so
she was very excited to see
which ones did you show her
um i showed her i showed her the lemur
i was curious if she'd remember what it was called from from the book
um and i pulled out the moose which she recognized she recognized it
um and i showed her the anteater
because that's another one i was like i don't know if she'd remember it or not
but um
but she seemed to pull out like she pulled out like the like the hooved animals
and the bears and the sea animals a lot on her own
yeah i noticed that she lik she likes
why do you think that is
um i don't know
um i'm trying to think what did we just go to we went to something not that long ago
where did we go
where did we go
we went to somewhere where we were lookin at sea animals
i can't even remember it
um i feel really badly now i can't remember
natural history museum
no we do go to the natural history museum a lot
but there was a museum we went to that had all kinds of sea animals at it
it was like um i don't know i'm gonna hav now it's going to bother me
i'm gonna have to call my husband and ask 
anyways they had tanks of like animals like all different kinds of sea animals and they had lobsters and octopus and and stuff but
um so we do take the kids to a lot of museums and things like that
um my older son really likes dinosaurs
so we go to the natural history museum so she's been going to the natural history museum for a long time
so but i dunno
so what are her favorite animals
her favorite animal
like today or just in general
in general
in general um her favorite animals are probably cats and horses
um cats we have two cats
so
um but she's always liked horses for some reason i don't know why
so she if we go to the library she'll she always ends up pulling a book about a horse
um or we got her like she likes like little horse animals and
um if we see horses she's very excited so
for some reason she likes horses a lot
um and then she likes she does like sea animals for some reason
yeah
so i don't
and none of those in particular that i can think of so
maybe 
i dunno
we do have an aquarium at home
but it's like a small rectangular one that just has little tropical fish so
lucy how would you like to go outside with elise
you wanna go for a walk
go for a walk with elise
for a little bit while i keep talking to your mom
you'll find some other toys down the hall
can you take a wal you wanna show her where you where the potties were
show her
maybe she needs help
yeah
and you can show her what else you found
can you show her and then come back
lucy you wanna come with me real quick
take a walk
you wanna go outside
you wanna go for a walk
yeah
okay
right back
i think the baby's gonna stay here
can you take her for a walk
we can take the baby
show her
do you wanna take the baby
there you go
sorry we just like to have a little quiet when
that's alright
that's alright
she was getting a little excited about the
she wa i know
um what of the foods did she i see there was some cooking going on
she decided to cook yeah
she um i dunno she decided well she decided this was a pot of something
i don't know wha she thought it was water at first but she was cooking that as a pot
and um she liked the peas and the cheese
and the pizza
yeah that was a that was a popular one
and she was very excited about this because she never gets to use this at home so
understandable
yeah so she go she could use it all she wanted so
in real life she actually does like pizza and she likes peas and she likes beans
an mashed potatoes
um she likes cheese a lot
um this she thought was a waffle
so she was cutting up a waffle we cut up her waffles so she was cutting up a waffle for the baby
um but there's other foods she likes that she didn't get to but yeah
the pizza and the cheese and the beans
she's she likes vegetables a lot
so yeah she likes vegetables and she does not like fruit
so her brother's the opposite he always
it's we have one one kid who we're always tryin trying to get to eat more fruit and one we're gettin tryin trying to get to eat more vegetables so
you know
but she's always liked vegetables a lot
so peas and beans she was happy with
do you have play food at home
we do
we do so
play food and pot little pots and stuff and there's a little kitchen so
um does she have a sweet tooth
she does
she does
um but she didn't really the the pie she thought was a waffle though
yeah
and she didn't see the cookie this time but she was very interested in it earlier when you were showin the cookie with some of the other stuff so
yeah
she does like cookies a lot
but we don't have pie very often at our house so that might be why she didn't even
she did like cupcakes
were there any foods that you showed her that you think she's probably not familiar with
um i don't know if i showed her well no the ki i didn't show her i we she looked at this one
she'd never probably seen this before
the kiwi
and she probably wouldn't she's seen these rarely
mushroo she's probably seen them a couple times at our house but by the time they get to the dinner table they don't look like this
so
i know all about that
so
um most of the things i think most of the things she would've seen at our house
somewhere or the other so
she seemed to be interested in the dolls
she does
she does
she likes her baby dolls a lot
so um but she doesn't she's she actually just got a couple of new ones it was her birthday and then a neighbor gave us some
excuse me
um but she doesn't usually try to dress up very often
so she usually just um she actually likes to take all the clothes off of them most of the time
and occasionally if she wants them dressed she comes and is like mom help and she'll have me try to put on whatever it is
but she usually tries to get all the clothes off of the baby dolls
and then she does other stuff with them like she likes to push them in a stroller or she has a little doll carrier to put them in
or she'll give bottles like she does other stuff but she doesn't like getting them dressed
so i
she seemed particularly interested in the feet
yeah i don i don't well she does like shoes a lot so
we always have laughed she's liked shoes since she was really little
and my husband's always like ah she's such a girl
it's like i dunno
she likes shoes more than i do so
is there anything you thought she'd be interested in that she wasn't and you were surprised
um i dunno
i thought she might like the puzzle a little bit more but i think she was just she likes the other stuff so um
it seemed like she looked at a lot of things
yeah
there was a lot of things she was really interested in
so um
i guess at our house we have we're ve my husband and i are very um organized people for the most part
he's a engineer and i used to work for i wasn't an engineer but i worked for engineering companies so both of us tend to be very organized
so all of our toys at home are like there's a bin of animals there's a bin of trains there's a bin of doll things
so everything's in it's own space so she doesn't usually get like a whole array of um intermixed toys um to look at
usually if she's playing animals then we say when you're done with the animals you pick up the animals and put them away and then you can move on to something else so
um we try to get
it doesn't work all that often but sometimes it does
we try to get her and my son to learn to pick up um what they finish with cause i get tired of picking up toys all all the time
so um we keep we always try to get them to pick pick up their toys and if there's a bin it's easier for them they just okay all the dolls go in there all the animals go in there and then it's done and it gets put off to the side till they can play with something else
so they don't usually get a whole array of a mix of toys
unless the house is really messy
so this is unusual for her
this is unusual for her to have this arrangement of toys
um the toys themselves
but yeah even like in our house our food toys are in our in our basement
um we have like a a finished basement she has all her food toys are downstairs but her dolls are upstairs
um she has a couple of things like a couple of small things that came with the baby dolls like uh spoons and bowls and some baby food jars and bottles that stay with the baby dolls but the actual food stuff is downstairs and the dolls are upstairs
um an like they're in her room and a lot of the animals are either in my son's room or out in the general area
so none of these toys are in the same place in our house
so she's just she was very excited
okay
just one more question
sure
um have you how have you noticed her play changing since the last time you came in
um let's see
how old was was it eighteen months
eighteen months
let's see um
it's a ways back
yeah i know i'm tryin trying to to think like what was she doing then
um probably one big thing i've noticed is she is she started doing um more of the make up play
like if she would take like like two of these animals and say like this one goes that goes there and she would bring this one and he goes next to it and she might bring up another one and stick it like they pretend they're talking
so she's starting to do more of imaginative play with whatever toy whether it's this or my son's cars or whatever
you know she's starting to um do that kind of play
you know it used to be just she'd pick it up and look at it and might talk to it but not actually have the toys interact
so so she is doing that now
um and i dunno
baby dolls she's probably she's liked her baby dolls since she was about a year
but she probably she's a little more possessive about her baby dolls now
um she gets a little bit more attached to them if somebody tries to take one she gets more um attached like she's the mommy and that's her baby and you don't take the baby from the mommy
so she does that
um and i dunno i think she's doing a little more imitation of me lately
um you know i notice things like even in the car how she's trying to get into her carseat and things like
i noticed um just the way cause i noticed she was trying to sit with her buckles the way that i sit with my seatbelt on
and i was like you're really watchin
so but i think i noticed at the house she tries i think she's tryin trying to do a little bit more i think she's tryin trying to copy me a little bit more
it used to be i think she'd copy she copied her brother a lot
and she still does
and um she would copy dad also but i think she's starting to realize that mom does some things and dad and brother do other things and she's starting to copy more of what mom does
so
and my son kinda did the same thing i think when he was he copy started at some point copying more of dad
but see if that carries on or not
okay so that is the end of the study
wow
yep
so we have cooler toys than the
than the prior visits
yeah oh i like these little
my daughter would like this
animal thing
she likes dollhouses and
so which um
which of our foods did he seem particularly interested in
uh
well the fuzzy peach and the fuzzy kiwi
and he liked the corn
the chicken
yeah
and he seemed to like the sort of
formed rubbery
food
which
i have to say it does a fun
kind of interesting texture to it
are any of these things that you have um
in toy form at home
you know we
we bought a house
since we were last here
and because we have no playhou
playroom in our house we don't have a toy kitchen up
so he doesn't play with toy food at home
he only plays with it when he goes to friend's houses or
when he's out and about
how about in real life are y are any of these
oh yeah in real haha
in real
yeah
i mean he eats a banana almost everyday
he
he
yeah he loves green beans
he likes cookies
though he doesn't eat that many of them
he certainly
they're certainly memorable when he does i guess
i know
cookies are something
you like them
they're a bit more memorable than green beans aren't they
huh
yeah i mean a lot of these pizza obviously
he has cheeseburgers when we go out
corn on the cob he has
um
not too many beets
not too much pie
yeah were there any that you figured were unfamilar foods for him
yeah these like this would probably mean nothing to him
and
actually this would probably mean nothing to him
uh
wow that's really smart
it fits
heehee
that's neat
look at this
this is a book with a bunch of animals in it
here you go
oh
well gentle with mommy
uhoh
and he sees me use the pizza knife
on quesadillas
all the time
so that's why he's
very found of that
ah
how the animals
um
well you know he has a good
he uh well let's see which ones did he like
i dunno he liked the penguin
i think because
we like penguins in our house
for some reason
and he liked the panda
and there oh the duck
he liked the duck
he really likes ducks
ducks were the first animal he really sort of took a thing
a liking to
really ah
saying quack and
all that kind of stuff
and he still likes ducks
he loves to see them in person in real life
he absolutely loves ducks
oh that's nice
were there any that were new
for him
that you tr
well yeah i mean i didn't even go into them too much
but i would say that like a beaver would be new to him
and
you know ostriches
they're in books
but again because he doesn't really sit and look at books that much
that one
uh yeah the ostrich
probably this anteater
that's what that is right
he probably wouldn't be familiar with that
the eel
so some of them have a cheat
i'd like to
no this one is just says made in china
yeah hah
i think that's an anteater
right yeah i think so
yeah i think so
it looks like yeah
but that would be new
we just saw a peacock at the zoo last week
although he did not ever fan out quite like that
but we enjoyed the peacock when we saw him at the zoo
did um does he play or help you in the kitchen
well he's usually more of hindrance
but he loves being in the kitchen
and he likes to
i mean to his own detriment
he we have an island and he tries to get up and
cook and he
felt heat one time and so now he's truly understands hot
um he didn't hurt himself or anything but he
he's very
he's very self sufficient in going and getting a chair
i mean he's chronically
in the last week and a half up on the kitchen counter
you know rummaging through the snack cabinets and
you know he's really not to be trusted very much and so
he does like to be in the kitchen
and he does like to cook
he seemed to have good play routines that involve um
well i didn't see chopping but
cooking
yeah yeah he he likes
routines
he likes to watch
op op
woop careful bud
that moves huh
he likes to
i think he should come out
yeah
he likes to watch me cook
do you need something to go under
here
yeah
here try this one
you don't like it
okay well you don't have to go under anything bud
um
but i'll put a real pot on the floor
or a real frying pan and give him a real spoon and just like him
do that when i'm cooking
so he knows mixing
yeah
and stirring and
yes
he does know that
cause yeah it seemed like
a routine he knew
yes
and i noticed he found our junk food
heehee you know what yes
exactly
and i try to limit
i mean we eat a fairly good diet in our house but
like i said i think a cookie is pretty memorable once you've had one
you remember the cookbook you remember the cookies
yeah
so
you know you rock the line between
and it's one per school
yeah
well he'll
yeah
he seemed interested in the tools at least the beginning
he absolutely loves toy tools
he loves
eh you know it's definitely something
imprinted on the d n
because all those boyish things
the trucks
the tools
he's
you know
was
the trains he completely love
oh there it is
wes she found the rest of the screwdriver
he really loves
he really loves those things
here
oh
you made a poop
um is there anything that he really loves to play that we didn't have today
you know he loves toy cars and trucks
that's probably his favorite thing right now
just like a you know like a like a he's got a dumptruck this big at home
normally a
and he fills up the bed with
anything like we have little pompoms in the house right now
from a craft project
and he will
he'll spend a half hour
just filling it with pompoms
dumping it out
driving it around
filling it up dumping it out
he loves
small things that he can
carry around with his fingers
and put places and he also likes to
i was surprised he didn't do it cause he loves to make choo
like he'll take
a bunch of his little matchbox cars and line them up and say choo
push his choo and
um he
that's so i would say vehicles are a
favorite thing of his right now
i think um languages wise
you get a lot of room and
so we have
we notably don't have a lot of vehicles
yeah
yeah
because you don't always get as much language
yeah
in that kind of play
yeah
that um
but a a lot of people have missed them
oh where did it go
it's in your hand you've got the screwdriver
ha your like your mommy
there you go you got it
is there anything he really wasn't interested in
well i guess the dolls didn't get much of a
he actually he likes his sister's barbies
they're small they
you know
he'll grab one and carry it around with a death grip and
it's pretty cute
he likes the barbies at home
and you know he'll look at a babydoll now and again
but nothing i mean i remember
my daughter at this age at two was just
enthralled with baby dolls and
pushing them and feeding them and all that and that's not
a great interest for him
watch your head please
he also quite liked our little family
yes he did
that was just warm up
actually yeah i
yeah
didn't expect him to get ha
yeah
yeah
but he really likes
um
yeah and i think those are more barbie like
you know like the little small things
and again he just
he loves the little things he can clutch in his hands and grab and carry around on his very own
oh you're fixing it
thank you
it isn't very sturdy
it could use some fixing
ha heehee
he's also he has a real ear
doesn't he for sounds
he does his replication of the sounds
i think
obviously is still coming along
but when he's in the moo
i mean it's funny cause when he first started saying anything at all
lauren got a real kick out of sitting at the dinner table or the lunch table
and just being
you know wes say spoon
spoon and
a i mean
he will do a lot that she does
he'll do a lot for her
he really kind of looks up to her
and so that was sort of a game that they did for a while
and
um
you know i try as much as i can in everyday life just to talk
clearly with him and speak with him
and uh
you know i don't make it to monotonous in terms of repeating
the bluh
but i'll always try to label things
i also meant that a everything that he picked up
he discovered
oh that kind of sound yes
what qualities he had
yes
he does like to do that
he was he was
he was really
y
you know interested
i got him a really nice drum for his second birthday actually
like a really nice floor drum and
yeah
cause he does he likes that kind of thing
that sounds like a really
appropriate present for him because i thought he
yeah
you know pays attention what kinds of different sounds he can make
yeah
he likes actually
that's another thing he likes the toy musical instruments at home
he likes the maracas and
he got a really cool toy for his second birthday called a saxoflute
which you can build out
of flute it's a really cool thing it's
o
sixteen different tubular pieces that depending on how you configure them make different sounds and a couple of them have ho so you can actually
oh wow
play it a little bit
it's a really great toy
i actually think it's pretty fun so
my son does that with his trumpet
when he's twelve
also it involves things he puts in there haha
yeah yeah yeah
it's a good thing
but that is fun to see i wonder um
uhoh
and we didn't you know i didn't
go to look so i'm just gonna ask you
if he were turning pages in a book
is he meticulous about one at a time or does he miss
he's not very meticulous
he'll still turn it hold it upside down and look at it
you know he's just
so he's more of a multiple
yeah
turner
i would say he's more
i mean we'll
i'll say this when he's interested in reading
like when i kept he in those moments and he's interested in reading
he will be very particular about wanting to see each page
and he'll
you know especially with the board books they're so thick and sometimes he'll feel like there should be another page but it's just one page
yeah yeah
but
if he were to
just kind of have that in his hand to look at
he wouldn't be very particular about that
hi bunzers
well that makes sense
it's hard to fix things
well then
that's all she wrote for today
okay
let me just get out i have
a few more
permission slips
and then he can pick out a toy i think i have some um
t r u c k
oh okay
and then really all i want to see him do um
so what kinds of things did he like playing with today
um well good night
that's his favorite book
yeah
we read it every day for nap time and bed time
so i'm not surprised he grabbed it
lots of times he'll sit and read it to try to go to sleep himself but
and he has favorite things in it
um it depends on the day
it seems like some days he really likes the good night page and other days he likes the good night good night
ah
today i think he was a little i do tired
and him being a little spazzy
it's a long day for them huh
yeah
yeah um were there any toys that um he's had experience before being here
the kitchen
we have a play kitchen at home
uh so he really likes
it's not exactly like this
it's a big one
but um he likes to make things in the kitchen
mostly he makes coffee
oh yeah
yeah
and what was uh what does he like to do
was he stirring or
he's mixing
ah
he likes to mix
he makes cookies
oh that's neat
and what about we have uh a lot of animals here
were there any that h he liked to play with
he didn't really seem into those
were there any that that you tried to show him that he just
i tried to show him the pig and the sheep and some of the ocean animals
how cute
um is there anything about how he usually plays that we didn't really see today of
um well he's not usually like crazy with the book
he usually will sit and actually read it
um but that may have just been today
as you notice when he's tired he does get a little more um unfocused
um well i asked him to do a lot of things and some were easy and some were not
yeah
so that
yeah he used up a lot of brain power
yeah
had you seen this one before
no that was a new one
this is also by the good night fame person
yeah
which is interesting
yeah and here again another version of corn
yeah
so do you think that that was that popped out was that do you think he got corn or no
uh he knows corn
we have fake corn at home but it's just yellow
i wonder if the green
kinda kind of threw him off a little bit
well that could be easy huh
so he knows if it's corn on the cob
good night
your favorite book right
no
does he usually take a nap
yeah yeah he does
and you got fishies
by usually by twelve thirty
but he was up early this morning
aw poor bunny
i'm thinking 
i noticed that he um is really interested in letters
um his current obsession is numbers
but previously it was letters
everywhere we went he would just shout letters
everywhere that he saw them
so yeah he kinda kind of switched from letters to numbers
and he seems to um identify them
all of them yeah
wow
yeah it surprised me
is his sister also interested
i wonder if it's a if it's a joint
yeah yeah they play together all the time so
an she knows all her letters s
so he's just gonna going to do it too
yeah i guess whatever she does he does
that's great
oh that's really neat
what does he like to play with at home that we didn't have here
um he loves to climb stuff
so we have like a little play climber that he can climb on
and he loves that
um he likes he kinda likes to do whatever she's doing
he really likes to draw
an color
um he likes to throw anything everything
um he'll he will play with balls for hours
he likes to draw with chalk outside
we do that a lot
um and sometimes he'll do he'll do puzzles
depends on if he's in the mood for it
well he was really ready to do ours
they're they are pretty straightforward but
yeah
yeah
that was neat
well we basically are done
okay
wow
so gee you guys
you know what
you can show lauren the food
show
make something with
this is miss lauren
hi will
just like laura
she looks hungry
miss laura
it's laura not lauren
okay
okay
did you want to talk with me now
okay
okay
yeah
so he was here a year ago
twelve months
plus two
yeah
he didn't have an eighteen month one
it's just a twelve month one
um he did
well i think he did
okay
we have just now recently added an eighteen month visit
okay
eighteen
he was too old by the time
got it
okay
if they would like to have one
so we are now having kids come in for eighteen monthers months
okay
so it's just a play session at that
but we want to kind of hear the play
um was there anything he was especially interested in playing with today
he loves to play with food
he loves to make things
and he loves animals
so he doesn't really care about
apple
that's not an apple
did you say that so did you say he got a stove
we gave him a kitchen
a little ikea kitchen
for his birthday last week
so he got a little
and last yes this last night actually my husband put away put together the microwave part of the kitchen
stir
yeah
to make things he loves to make things with me in the kitchen
so that's very fun for him
he loves to play things with the make things in the mixer
aw that sounds like fun
is there anything that um
are these foods that you think he recognizes
that he eats
which ones
um
probably ice cream for sure
ice cream cones
ah maybe peas
although he didn't seem to say what they were
ah corn on the cob for sure
maybe some of the fruits
um yeah i mean mushrooms
were there any that um he hadn't seen before
probably
i don't think he recognized tuna
probably didn't recognize he recognize cheese and cupcakes
i don't know if he would have recognized i doubt he would have recognized the kiwi
maybe he would've
pepper
it doesn't matter
he makes things whatever they want
does he have some food does he make food with it
we um he has a birthday cake
that's all we have
it's like um a little melissa and douglas wooden birthday cake that he puts together
and he likes to do
but he makes birthdays are very special for him
he makes birthday cakes out of legos
out of whatever
and he'll come and sing happy birthday
oo
so
good
but yeah that's the only food play food that he has
i used to have a big candle in with my playdough just for that
to put the birthday
yeah they love they play with playdough um probably three or four times a day they wanna ask to play with playdough so
playdough
he also seemed interested in animal toys
yeah he really likes animals
yeah
i mean and he has he has some of these same kind of animals
he has the farm ones
ah
but i didn't recognize any of
um he doesn't seem to have any of these
he has like a cow
maybe he has a pig
a dog and a
were there any a couple you introduced him to today
oh yeah
i mean ones i don't know if he wouldn't like
for example
um i don't know what he would've read
maybe he would've remembered the leopard from like richard scary books
but i don't think the sea otter
don't have a sea otter
or i guess this is a baboon
i dunno what kinda animal it is
um the swan
i mean he the words are familiar to him
the swan
but he still calls most birds that look kinda like ducks ducks
and then i don't know
he's familiar with these
oh okay
we went to a farm and saw pheasants and turkeys
but i don't know if he would've been able to identify he doesn't know how to identify all of these
yes yeah
i can't wait to take him to the zoo this summer again
it's been a while since we've been
yeah
maybe not when it's ninety six
maybe not when it's ninety six degrees exactly
feeling
does he have so you say he has some animals
he has um he has some stuffed animals
and he has um he loves richard scary books
so we go to the zoo page
you know
and he points to the animals
um
turn it over
turn it upside down
yeah and i mean he has he has a horse and a cult
and a cow and a calf
and a pig and a dog
yeah so some of these exact same kind of animals
the same brand
boy they are nice
yeah
is there anything that he really loves to play at home that we really didn't see today
he loves legos
he loves to play with legos
but it's the not the it's the
the blocks
my blocks i guess
and um he plays with the kitchen
and
he's an accomplished block builder
yes he loves to play with you know blocks
but he's he has a younger brother
so he plays with his younger brother all day long
so it's his older brother is interested in legos
you know
and they play outside in the sandbox also
a lot
and making
he making oatmeal
probably oatmeal yeah
we have oatmeal in the morning a lot
he likes oatmeal right
yeah
um flat
is there anything else you've noticed like recently
about
two year old play
what he likes to play
um well he um i mean um his really his favorite thing to do is to be outside
playing in the mulch or the dirt or the sandbox
that's what he would and he would play there with his trucks
or making oatmeal
or making things
what do you play what do you like to play with in the mulch or the sandbox
daddy says no more mulch right
but you play in the sandbox
what do you do in the sandbox
play with your brothers in the sandbox
oh
he loves um construction trucks
he loves construction sites
he loves planes
building trucks
so actually yeah that's true they didn't have a lot of them
no
trucks
i didn't even think about but i didn't think about it cause it's not like
you know he plays with other stuff too
um i'm not always good for language
so i get a lot of vroom vroom
sure that's right vroom vroom
exactly
it's true
that's a good that's right right right yeah what you're looking for
and then we don't always get what we from them
yeah that makes sense
do you want to show him the book
just hand it to him see if he'll turn pages
hey what's this
i think that is about it
i um i missed two tests
okay
i'm like three items shy of this kind of visual is this the same or different test
okay
and um
do you wanna try it now
i mean after that okay
i might yeah
he's probably he's actually been diverted
he seems like he's gotten himself a
i dunno
you can try anyway
um and then it's the shape
okay
and there also things that if you could do with him that would be fine
okay
aw
uhoh
look
here
it seems far from him
what's that
the penguin is here with your dolls
so we have cooler toys
yes
oh yah
yah
he's doesn't
have any of the food stuff
oh no
um no
he has um
for his birthday his
his grandmother just got him like a cupcake
you make happy birthday cupcake
you know the melissa and doug type wooden
oh yah
things
and then
um
he has some vegetables but
otherwise it's all like puzzles
and animals and
tools so he
doesn't have anything like this yet so
it's cool
yah he seemed to
know what that was
oh yah
yah
that's a dolphin
does he have a tool belt at home
like tools
he well he has a ton of tools
like toys
uh everything i mean he got hand me downs
and he got his uncle got him a whole
shark

oh here's the doctor
ah uhoh
he'll make it better
yah
he does a he has a little doctor's kit
he loves that
he had a lot of um cooking play routines though
oh i cook all the time
so i don't know if it's just watching me
or what but
yah because uh what did i see
i saw that he could
stir and
what else
does he do
um
i don't know
he kept wanting to put everything in the pot
and know he knew everything was hot
and everything like that so
that's that's for sure
um
that's true
that was neat
are there any foods here that he would um
eat actually in real life
oh yah
yah definitely um
the cupcakes
the banana the corn
the peas
hotdog
ice cream
those all pretty familiar
we really try get a good
it's a good
mix although it's hard
you were able
to find all those things
to put on a sandwich
huh
oh yah
what do you like cheese
or what
tuna cheese and uh pickles
oh perfect
i just do we have bread
or does it matter
yah
oh okay
a hamburger roll
that's good
we also have some sweets over here

we also have some
of the some sweets
oh yah
that's in there
yah he
saw the ice cream and the cupcakes
you like the cupcakes
you want me to take that off
okay
okay
turn around
you wanna play with the animals
sure
well he um
he really likes those animals huh
he does
he does
now uh they like it
do you have stuffed animals at home
he has he has a combination of stuff
because it's
stuck
cause it's a combination of um
things
of hand me downs
and some new things
so he has a lot of um
you can just
oh ouch
oh he'll help you
oh here
what happened
he's a doctor
he'll fix it
ah is that better
good
its the dolphin shark bit him
oh no is he all better

oh it was right here
on his tummy
uhoh
here
i know
and does he know some of these animals
put some new shoes
yah he definitely knew most of them
i mean he doesn't have the style
he has like the fisher price
um
the ones that have a circle on the bottom
so they're more
cartoonish almost
i don't know
but um
he knows most of em
cause he has a noah's ark
so he's got a good variety of
ah
of the animals
um
so yah like
zebra
shark
penguin
bear
right there
and the lobster
i don't think he knew the lobster
alex do what's this
i don't know that he knew the lobster
he knows crab
well i don't know about the lob but i don't know about the lobster
put the socks on
do you need oh shoe on
where's another shoe
there's another
you need another one
good genesia will help
let's put his socks on
and um is there anything that
he usually likes to play
that we didn't see
um
he does a lot with like cars
and trucks
and trains
it's vocabulary limited we just give room
sure sure
i can understand that
yup um
otherwise
we do we do a lot of outside
especially now
so he has a lawn mower
like his you know miniature one
which he'll push for hours
and um
any kind of ball or
bat or
do you have
golf he's got this little golf thing
he's got a ton of
he got spoiled
on his second birthday
from all the family
yah
um i noticed
he's got good play routines
for the animals though
too he um
you know
he feeds them and
what other kinds
of things does he do
um i would say
feeding them
and sleeping
that's the biggest thing
um and then he'll do stuff
like doctor
type things
so if one gets hurt
he'll give it a kiss
yah so he does that
um
and they were swimming
right at the very beginning
yah
i said
should they go swimming but
i don't know
he wasn't quite uh
he wanted to throw
the mud in the water
oh the mud
he said he said ew
he said
i think it's a burger right
i was wondering
it does look like mud huh
that's perfect
uh and most kids
don't actually have an eel
no he's no he's never seen
that before
so that was neat
he's got a lot of i think
i guess he also has a vocabulary
for the animals
from the books
that he reads
cause he's really
he's a
book kid yah
yah
we read books all the time
he likes that
that's a
lobster yah
well that was really fun to see
well he was
you know
he was good with the kitchen
that was
interesting
i
that is something i like i'd like to have
he does he has a
wheels
that's true
that's true
we actually just finished
renovating uh our kitchen
it took about seven months
we just finished it
in february
um so
yah yah
we don't have we don't do much
with um ani uh dolls
oh no
he doesn't really have any dolls
he has like animals and
like a baby
i don't think
he has any baby dolls
he has bears
his he's been really into that lately
like this morning
when i picked him up
out of bed
um his he wanted me to bring
all of his animals
all his bears
and his donald duck
and everything
and everything
and bring it with us
and last
night when read our books
we read our books
with donald
and your bears
and your monkey

doesn't have any dolls
so
these are big kid dolls
well whenever he sees um
someone else with a doll
he always wants it
so
this is cute
yah
he loves dress up
yah
yah
he definitely likes dress up
anything that's a hat
or a helmet
and um
capes
oh
we'll use blankets or towels or
something you know
he loves that
so
oh that's great

parent's because um we have a lot to do
yah you have a lot to do no
no i think that's great

okay
that's i wanted to ask you a couple things about you know our new toys
sure haha
what um what kinds of foods did she like to play with
um i can't decide if she liked or didn't like the the squishy ones
um i think she did
um but definitely the cupcakes were her favorite
and the fact that they fit so easily in a um real looking pan
yes
was good
what kinds of food here does she eat
um she eats cupcakes
she has seen all these vegetables but does not eat them
she eats oh no she has seen peas and green beans
she eats ice
she eats pizza
um tuna she seemed to like but doesn't eat
um and she eats pears but not in this form
she knows this form
yeah yeah
she might have that at school
and then she kept saying i guess this was a pear or an apple
so i i know she knows it's a fruit
but she hasn't seen that form of peach in a long time either
yeah
were there any other things that you had told her what were
um i guess the beets
she calls bananas nani
i think i told her cheese
and i know i didn't know if this was an onion or a beet
or i don't know what it is
she seems to really like cooking
what kinds of cooking routines
she seems to have a number of she knows to

um she does bo she do
she bothers me haha
she bothers me in the kitchen a lot haha when i cook dinner
my husband isn't home yet

um
she also seems to know to mix and
yes

and she likes to like briefly feed them briefly pat them
oh they look so good
but not you know do any like long scenes with 
but she'll watch me do it
you know for a long time pretend
she seems pretty interested in their clothes
she um is very interested in everybody's clothes
like when my husband and i wake up early in the morning she immediately tells us what to put on
like she makes my husband put a shirt on right away and pants
and his tie
and then when he gets home in the afternoon she immediately wants his tie off
like she associates a lot of parts of the day with clothes
so um so i think that's that's you know part of her thing
and she's picky about her own clothes as well
you're so silly
and shoes and socks are important
shoes and socks yes
yes i think that's the um that was the first thing she learned to take off herself so
yes honey
and she's very aware of her all nighttime routine
so like we sing to her
we read to her
and she sleeps with her cup and her foxy
and she's a good sleeper
and good to go down
so i think she's um it's easy for her to pretend that routine too
she likes to play that
and also birthday has made a big impression
yes for sure yeah
she just had a birthday this month or ah april
is there anything that you tried to get her interested in that she just didn't want
um yeah i wanted
i think that haha that this toy is cool
i always think those kind of toys are cool
but they're never neither of my daughters are ever too interested in like those little play scene things
they'd much rather do pretend play
which is fine with me too
i understand
so silly
cupcake there they go
what are they really
she's also more of a destructive player than my older daughter
like she you know will do this
throw stuff
knock down towers immediately haha
um but i think it's just part of her personality
she's like
and her number two status
always
yeah yeah
true
what you can do when you participate and you're the little one is sometimes more on that end
and she thinks lots of things are hilarious
oh that is hard
gentle
gentle yeah
cupcakes
go find them
is there anything she loves to play with at home that we really didn't have here today
she um because of her sister is very into princesses
like the disney princesses
and she um pretends to like she'll hold them and sing like them
that's that's like i would say what shh how she plays ninety percent of the time haha
it's lovely to hear her sing
yeah haha
she w she was interested in the backpack huh
she likes wearing backpacks herself
she um she always has us put a backpack on for her
and she watches dora the and they have a backpack
and the backpack sings
so she knows that song too
where is it
can you walk around and look for it
hah i see it
what do ya say
delicious
delicious
did you have good night moon out at all
i'm sorry
did you have good night moon out
yes
um she we have that we have like four copies of that book
but she's not interested in that particular story
she reads princess stories
um but um shh again with stories she understands the end
she understands the last page
we can tell if she's tired or not because she'll say
the end
or she'll be
again again
and open to the beginning so
um she does like books
it took a really long time for her to like books
but now she likes them
she can sit for them haha
right
yeah
good
is it yummy
cheese and peas
is that silly
you wanna cook some peas
i think that's a good idea
excuse you
we're all done
okay
i'm gonna have you wear that for a couple more minutes
okay
while i ask you a few questions
okay
and chelsea will play with katarina
can we clean up
katarina do you wanna eat more cheese
so what did you all play with first
um we played with the shoes the baby doll shoes first
okay
what did you play with after that
after that we played with the uh food
okay
does she have pretend food at home
yeah
yes we do now
we just got them for her birthday
okay great
so what objects um does she recognize
or that she may have at home
well as far as pretend food i mean she has mostly pretend fruits and vegetables
i dunno if there's like apple would be the same
but i mean she recognizes from real food
she recognizes the cheese and the ice cream and cookies and cupcakes
um and the juice
okay um what other items did she play with
um mostly just the toy foods and the baby dolls
okay um
oh and she also played with that beaver
okay
what foods did she put in her soup
um the she put cheese and um tuna and peaches and
cupcakes
and ice cream i think
um okay
can you name the other ingredients in there
sorry you can go ahead and look in there
i can look
um a cookie and the peanut
okay
and yeah i think did i say the peach already
okay
oh and then i guess there were the beets but we called them chocolate cookies
okay um okay
what is she holding now did she play with those
the peas
yeah
um were there other other animals besides the beaver that she may have interested in
uh the z the zeb oh that she's interested in
or that she played with
oh the zebra yeah the zebra
you havin fun
and then you were playing with utensils a little bit
yeah the spoon and the bowl and plate
okay
um and the pot
for cooking the soup
okay um there were some fruits she was mistaking for an apple
oh the beet or the or the uh the fruit oh the kiwi and the peach i think maybe
and do you regularly have um soup
we have soup in the house a lot
well not so much now that it's summer but in the winter we did yeah
okay
what was she not interested in
she didn't really i mean for the most part she didn't interact with most of the toy animals or the uh the play i dunno what you call that but
the wooden playset i guess
um yeah
i think and the books
i didn't know that there was books out there but yeah
okay
he can play and we can talk
okay alright
tell me about the kinds of things
you need a diaper
um i have rarely seen him play pretend like that
so that was new
that was neat
yeah
which food did he play with
um he played with mostly everything on top
and even if it was un ow unidentifiable he'd play with it
where you going buddy
so he got what he got donuts and
donuts
and apparently i've learned this is tuna
haha it's questionable
and cheese
and cookies
but he didn't know what this one was either
and he played with it
mostly because
what is it
i'm guessing it's beets
that's cheese yeah
and corn
and peas
okay
what's that
kiwi
yum
yeah that's something we had to tell a lot
yummy
yeah what what happened with the pie again
oh he thought it was pizza
so i told him it was pie
thank you
and then he played a whole bunch with the sea creatures
yup
which um
thank you
is that ice cone
hah wow look at this
and and now which of these did he know the names for
i thought
um he knows dolphin very well
and he thought everything that was kind of dolphin related was a dolphin
but we
but you
but we told him what the what the names were
he knew crab
he know turtle
he knows duck
he did not know lobster
but he knew the others
and fish
that was funny
yeah
that was really funny
um and then he played i guess
kitchen stuff
um he played with the cups
he played with the different foods
i took the pan out for him
but he played a lot with this
and going and going off and on
i'm always tempted to get rid of it
because
sometimes just dinging
for a long time
and then he came over here
and he really gravitated toward the tool and the plastic thing
do you think he knows
he's got a set that's got a tool thing like that at home
so he's got something similar to that at home
so you think he knows screwdriver and
sometimes
i mean
i heard it buddy good job
and this also during the test i wasn't sure
sometimes he answered yes and sometimes
he knew what it was after i asked him a couple times
but
but he did come up with corn i thought
yup
mushroom
yeah
sure enough
and he usually asks if he doesn't know something
oh that's great
are there any toys that he had experience with before the session
we've got this at home
and we've got something like this
but not exactly this at home
but everything else
i mean he's played with like figurines
but not very often
on the edge probably of what's safe too
yeah
um is there anything else that he didn't do here that's really big in his play at home
um no
he's actually really into like cars and trucks and things
and we don't have any cars and trucks so
that's true
this is mostly new newer stuff for him
because then people say vroom vroom and then pretty much
yeah
but he was really interested in everything that's great
it's for pizza
a pizza cutter
or playdough
it's a pizza cutter
haha yeah we'll go with the tshirt because we like the tshirts
yeah that's fine because the last one we had shrunk pretty well so
alden do you want a tshirt
mommy likes the tshirts
i wanted to talk to you about um the kind of things he played with today
and um our toys are a little bit different then the then the little littler kid ones
ours are cooler
yeah
of course
yeah what things did he seem to enjoy playing with
today
well um i was um surprised we don't really have this stuff at home but all the food stuff
yeah
um right now we are living with my mom
and she is super cook
so i think that he has really noticed all of that
yeah
and i mean at home he has different kinds of toys
but this is something i mean i would have thought i would have picked the animals
yeah
uh but the food stuff he really seemed to take a shine to
oh that's neat and he's been over there working on it
for a long time
yeah
you know putting things places and kind of organizing it
usually he just throws things around so this is interesting it's kind of a new new thing
he seems very busy are there any food items that he plays with that you think he recognizes
that he knows from
oh yeah
i mean right he said that lump of something i think he called it cheese
the pizza
peas and juice and fruit
so
are there any of them that you think were new
that you
um
i don't think he knows what this is
and there's some that i think are deconstructed like you know the hamburger thing i don't think he necessarily knows what that is cause
we don't really give him sandwiches so much
yeah
so but he might know what it is because we eat it
um recognize things were dessert
versus regular food
which is interesting because we don't give him all that many sweets
yeah
so oh cookie
or that he picked those little cupcakes
yeah that was interesting huh
um how about with the animals are there any that are favorites of his
um well the kangaroo
um he has a stuffed kangaroo so he really likes the i think it's one of his favorites
ah
and um and the panda bear he really liked but i think that moose was pretty new
and the warthog but we didn't really play with him
play with him
a lot of these would be new to him
but we didn't really go go to them but some of them were pretty familiar
so
which ones of them did you play with
um i think all the ones that are up there
and i don't we really didn't do much playing
i just kinda showed them to him
he was really interested in the food
um but the turkey and the beaver we've just been reading a story about a beaver
so that was that that's a relatively new one
and um what else is up there
oh the he loves monkeys
oh
so that's it is bad that we were but
i'll let that slide
well you know it has been really a pleasure he has really lovely symbolic play
oh great
where he um he's able to put them they're all on a trip they're all in a party
not not because i thought he would but he was clearly interested
and able to play symbolically and very funny with my shapes
um i'm actually that's one thing that i have noticed
about him developmentally is that his he actually has a quite sophisticated for you know for a two year old
um sense of humor
yes
like he knows when things are funny we went to a story hour the other day at the library and
there was this whole story about a chicken
and it was just kept eating and getting fatter and fatter and this fox was watching him
the fox i'm just gonna wait one more day because that chickens just gonna get even bigger
and finally he couldn't take it anymore and he ran down the hill and uh
and he busted into the hen house
and the chicken ate him
he
he
was laughing
and remember that about the chicken when the chicken ate the fox
that was funny
and then he was laughing
and then he turned around to all the other kids and was like did you see that wasn't that funny
and he was laughing
and
oh that's great
are you eating that cheese
ah so do you have any similar toys to these at home
um we have we have some animals
uh we have we have puggles
um we i i've learned that his fine motor skills are a lot more advanced then i i think i gave him credit for
um so i mean we don't have any of these kinds of tools or twisting things i mean
we we give him like bottles and let him turn the caps on and off
but i don't i wouldn't say they're actually toys
um and he has a doll but i mean he didn't he doesn't really he's not very interested in people dolls
our doogie howser
yeah
or i mean we have a baby doll that you know opens and shuts his eyes and a cradle
and occasionally he'll be go over and pat him on the head and say oh oh
but that's about it but you liked your stuffed animals right your friends in your crib
and he has um he has a horse
like a stick
a horse um stick that he uses as a horse
and as a guitar
and as a golf club
he has many uses for it
yes that's
that was also fun
that the um little tiny piece screw driver bubble wand it could be many things for him
and that's that's a lovely thing to see in a two year old it's really great
that's good that's
are there any um is there anything that he really likes to play at home that we didn't really see today
oh oh
are you are you finished with your shopping
did you make me dinner i'm hungry
um well you have a lot of hats at home don't you joey
do you like to where hats
he does
he's got a cow hat that's also a farmer hat
and he has a fire hat and
uh marching band hat and
it's also it's my fathers navy hat
oh
but he uses it mostly for marching band
um and
he's this is um the more cerebral play that i've seen him engage in in in such a in such a long period of time
he usually is much more physical and
i feel like given the choice he usually would start running and
throwing a ball
like to run
or kicking
kicking a ball yeah
and a lot of tumbling
yes
um so that so this this is interesting
that he's so occupied
i'm i'm really at this point
yeah
and he's got really good um he knows what to do actions
with the tools
for cooking a saw him stirring and
he seems to be um generally pretty observant like if you show him how to do things a few times the thing with the penny was pretty interesting
that he couldn't get it in that other way yeah
yeah
that's
and um
i always feel mean
well i mean but it's interesting and he i could tell that he wanted to turn the thing but he that was his only solution to the problem
so it was interesting to watch that
yeah
but he's he is pretty determined and he he finds solutions to things
solutions
or he'll just go uh uh
we'll he's got good language for for help and stuck and i've have a problem come on
so that's good problem solving too
that's great did you play with our puzzles
oh a little bit yeah these are cool
and the poor animals
but he didn't really he didn't really he's not really interested
in them
i think they're neat
but um this wasn't really his did you see this
his thing today
what are you looking for the horse
what's that
what is this
that's not a horse is it
what is it
a zebra
right
and then we have our other creepy pull apart ones
i know they're but i kinda like them
yeah mister zebra
they're fun
i know i also feel like why
yeah yeah that i don't really understand that
there's a a lady who lives up the street that has um some like creatures in her garden
and most of them are kitties
right sue doesn't sue have them in her garden
ah
and then she also has a crab
and it's ginormous
he really doesn't like it
no he doesn't like the crab
we're in a little bit funny order but that's gonna be okay
okay
um i want to know um what she liked playing with today
well the food and the baby
those are her two main things at home
also yes
which of these foods does she have at home
ah let's see the corn
the cookies
the ice
ah let's see the peas
i think that the cheese and the pickles
yeah in terms of her play food
yeah
yeah
and what um in here is something that she would eat
in real life
oh
probably everything
she is not picky
haha she is not a picky eater
all her vegetables
yeah she's pretty good with the vegetables
if we put it out for her she's gonna eat it
oh that's great
yep
yep
even some of the weird ones i saw
beets
well
ah you know i think she would eat she would eat she'll eat anything
she will
i don't think we've given her i don't think we've given her beets
or mushrooms
but i know she would eat 
she's a yeah
adventurous
yeah
haha she likes to eat
good for her
i noticed she has nice play routines with food too
she's developed it
oh yeah especially with the baby
she likes to feed feed her baby at home
and she um she prepares the food too
yes
yes
yes
that's one of her big games at home
was she mixing or stirring
yes she was
yeah
well she was feeding the baby with a spoon
out of the pan
wow
yeah
that makes sense too
she seems to have a well developed sense off yummy
yes
haha yep
that is great
um and with the baby too she was interested in their wardrobe
yeah well we actually we don't have this many clothes at home for them to change them up
so i think she was excited to see that
where she could change their clothes
so
does do your girls dance
yes
yes they both take ballet
ah
so but they they dance around at home too
we'll put the music on and dance
so and then isabell especially loves to change her clothes during like throughout the day
she'll go up to her room and pick out new dresses and tutus especially
and bring them down
and want to wear them
not sophia but isabell somehow has this love of clothing
and is able to get in and out of it
that's interesting
well she'll come down and ask for some help
but yeah she just you know probably five outfits a day
and she was very clear about the tap shoes
yes
yeah exactly
that was really great
yep
yep
um was there anything that she didn't really want to play with
yeah
she wasn't really interested in the book
or this puzzle
although she likes puzzles at home
um or the the animals over here
but i think she just she saw the baby dolls and it was all over
yeah
haha
does she like good night moon at home
um we haven't read it to her too too often
but she's definitely heard it before
um but she likes books where she can pick out objects
yeah a lot of kids have favorite things
yeah
um i don't know about in this
probably the balloon
or the moon
she has a good night mister moon song that she sings
so yeah anything to do with the moon
were there any of these toys that you had to tell her what they were this time
um yeah i think there's a few things she said what's this
like this
and there were some foods
that like i i think she didn't know the beets
she was calling the turnip an apple
i think she pretty much knew oh well maybe with the donut
she didn't know what the donut was
but
that makes sense
and what about the animals
she oh she the octopus she thought was a spider
well
but yeah
its yeah she's yeah
she she loves the bugs
so that makes sense then
and um is there anything that she usually plays a lot or that we didn't see represented here
um no
she has some musical instruments at home that she plays with
um and we have these like toy houses
that she plays in
and she loves hide and seek
um so that's yeah i think that's that's pretty much it
yeah
so now we have only a little bit left
all you have to do is get her to say twenty seven words
okay haha
right see how well well she's cooperating
d you want me to keep this
yeah
um so we need to kinda talk about this play session like we talked about the other ones
sure
why don't you scoot ahead stevie
so what did he enjoy most
ah the kitchen
the the kitchen and food stuff
and ah looking at the animals
is um does he have kitchen kind of toys at home
we do
we have a play kitchen
and he spends a lot of time playing with it
and he also enjoyed the screwdriver and um screw set
he has um a handful of pretend toys at home that he also plays with a lot
yes
and um are there any of these foods here that you also have a play version of
um the some of the play ice and play cans
ah we have
and the play cookie we have a similar set
and the ah the hot and hot bun we have a similar set
but the realistic looking food we don't
and stuff with textures um we don't
yeah it seemed like he was really interested in the textures
it did
so i'm gonna have to
he likes those
but he comes over and
he does
he has a couple of um of books that have different pages
fuzzy fuzzy fuzzy
and you know feel the soft belly
and a curious george that he feels bumpy services
and smooth surfaces
two cakes
two cakes
are there any of these that he eats at home
ah the vegetables the peas and the beans are
um and he's had ice
rarely but it makes an impression
and cookies
um and hot
yeah
does he recognize peanut
he might have
um when he has peanut it's always in sandwich form
so um i handed it to him and he pretended to eat it
so um
so he seems also to be interested in the kitchen implements
yes he spends a lot of time at home also standing at our little at the little stove
and he and sometimes both he and his sister
sometimes it's just him
he'll go over and play
and pretend to cook food and open and close cupboards and move things around
and um they also both like helping me in the kitchen
also noticed he's a tool guy
he liked the tools
liked the wheel
yup
what do you think his favorite food to eat is
right nowadays it's
could be
his his favorite if i would let him would probably be any type of dessert food
cake or cookies
but as far as regular food goes he
would either be scrambled eggs or fruit
like he he'll eat a pile of grapes or um you know chow through two bananas and
he really yeah he really likes fruits
and he really likes scrambled eggs
those are the two things i can always always get him to eat
was there anything here that you tried to get him to play with that he wasn't really interested in
um he wasn't really interested in the dolls
um
we
he sort of liked the stuff
he liked the stuff
we have dolls at home and he will go and rock them
and and take care of them and stuff
um he likes taking the clothes off of them
ah and then he can't figure out how to get back on
and walks away
but he wasn't he wasn't really interested in playing with the dolls
but he does
he likes the animals
the show of choice in our house right now is either dora the or diego
and diego deals with a lot of animal rescue animal this animal that
and so they've been you know we've talked a lot about zebras and dolphins
and you know like we talk about what the animal is that he's rescuing
and so
has he gotten to visit
we've been to the zoo a handful of times it's been since the beginning of summer
and it's it's hard because the times that we've been there have been so many other kids
and so many other things to look at
that the animals back behind you know walls and glass are sort of secondary
um but now that he's recognizing more of them we should probably try and go again
um but he likes animals
a lot of our books also have animals
and he seemed to know what a farm was
knows what a farm is
um we have a farm playset
we have little people
and um we actually we have and then somebody else gave us another far
so we have two farm sets that the kids play with
and so they know their farm animals pretty well
ah
were there any do you have similar you said you have the farm animals
we have ah little people larger plastic farm animals
we don't have um like these are denser and more realistic looking
a little bit smaller
um so we don't we don't have ones like this
but we have version of farm animals
does he have favorite animals
um he likes going roar
so generally any type of lion or bear
um he likes
um he likes going roar
are there any here that you think you named for him the first time for him today
um yeah he took a lot of the birds and gave it
like this one it's a i don't know cockatoo i guess
um but it's a white bird with a large wingspan and he said
oh it's a hawk
it's an eagle
it's an eagle he said
um and the toucan he didn't know
so the specific birds
but i mean he knows birds in general
um the we talked about the the leopard or the cheetah
um with it having spots
he recognized it as a big cat but he called it a lion
um but it's still you know same same genre
yeah that makes sense
let's see if i got what i was supposed to get
is there anything he likes to play at home that we really didn't see today
um trucks and cars and things that go
um he really likes those
um lots of either driving them around
um we have one of those like little rugs from ikea that has the roads on it
and um little play areas
and he'll drive his cars around that a lot
we also have a set um it's just they're just sticks
and balls
but they're magnetic
and so you can connect them together
and you can go around and stick to everything that's metal
and build shapes out of it
he hasn't really gotten into building the three d shapes
but he likes sticking them together
likes how they work
and train sets
he likes his train set at home
yeah that just reminded me
hey buddy hey stevie
what's that
what is it
what do ya think this is is it a pickle
what is it
oh i know it's an elephant
is that an elephant
what is it
yeah
it was cracking me up that she was whispering
i know i know
but i i tried everything i could think of
she knows
and we weren't ready to get that today
what did she um what did she like playing with here
um she seemed to like those screws
i mean that that sorta grabbed her interest right away
oh yeah
and then she s kinda moved on to the the animals
were there any animals that she
the doll a little bit
oh yeah
a little bit with the doll
what's that elle
what ya doing
look at you cooking
that's okay you can do that
you gonna you gonna make us some lunch
yeah
you hungry
haha
now did she notice anything in particular about our dolls
just just this one
she was pointing out the hat and the shoes the black shoes
right
and the hair
are you feeding the dolly lunch
that's so nice
she's probably pretty hungry
what's she eating
haha
are there any of the animals that um you think were new to her
um i think a lot of them were new
i don't know if she's i don't know that she's ever seen an eel before
haha and this one she called a whale
which um i don't know that she knows really the difference between all the different you know dolphins and whales and sharks and
and she called this one a bug
ah well
it does kinda look like a bug
it's in the tree of life
little little buglike
does it say what it is
no
no i would guess lobster
but
it's almost the size
but that would be really obscure i guess
yeah
haha
and she really likes um good night moon
she likes she loves books
and she likes she likes books that are familiar
but she also will bring new books over
we have tons of books at home
and so she'll say she'll bring a book over and say
read this one
or she'll say
read it
she likes the mouse
she usually points out the full moon
and the stars and the mouse
and ah and there are most of the time now she knows the book well enough she'll finish the she'll finish the phrases
oh that's neat
yeah
sometimes
does she have
she points to different things in the pictures
i like these pictures there's a lot to look at
yeah
so she'll find different things sometimes
sometimes we'll kind of just stay on a page for a while
and she'll look at it and find different things
are there words that um you're sure that she would say everytime pretty much
which are the ones that you know
mush
haha
and are there any
usually she'll say mush just about every time and
mittens
are there any of the other ones that you're still working on you think
um i don't know that we're really working on any of them
i just kind of i don't always pause in the same places i guess
so i just like to see which which ones she remembers
ah or which ones she'll say if i point to the picture
so
are any of these toys like toys you've got at home
there are no particular ones
we have a big play kitchen at home
with lots of pots and pans and utensils and play food and stuff so
just that
and we do have some dolls
um we don't have anything like this
these are great
haha these are really cool
yeah doctor ratner really worked
and um and actually my older daughters have a couple of the word world
one has dog
and one has cat
so she ah she sees those
i was surprised that she didn't pick up sheep and and bee she knows how they come apart
ah kids are a little older
haha
yeah well there's it's the show on p b s that my four year olds like to watch
i bet
so
and she watches it sometimes right
ellie is eating pizza
donna do you have four year old twins
yeah
they they came to one study
um it wasn't here
it was in a a different department i think
ah and i don't remember which department it was in
yeah it might have been psychology
i remember shh she had them look at pictures of things
like um you know a picture of like five small ducks
and then one big duck
and asked them which one was more
oh interesting
and ah i remember that one
and there were a few other things that they had them do
it it was a really interesting one actually
cool
yeah i thought it was kind of cool
is there anything else that ellianna likes to play that we didn't really
see today
it really depends so much on her mood
you wanna he do you wanna read some more books ellie
yeah
ah we have a we have a couple books in our bag
i don't know if that if they need to be your books
do you wanna
here you go honey
do you wanna look at those
do you wanna read the barn book
oh don't worry we do that
in tranquility later it's fine
um what kinds of things did he enjoy playing with today
um he li well the animals
the shoes
um this little the word world
sheep that came apart
i think he was a little confused
he was like
oh
yeah i i guess they are related to a show huh
and also for me slightly creepy
on p b
yeah it's called word world
on p b
and we have a couple of those
oh hey show vidda the bubbles
that's new today
and it's a good time for bubbles in the spring
yeah um are there toys here that he had had experience with before
yeah the play food
blow
and here the pot
and and the spoon
are there foods that you played with that he was likely to recognize
um oh you mean from here or
yeah
um recognize eating or from pl
either or
um he would recognize the pizza
and the banana
the cheese
the cookies
not the jalapeno peppers haha
um the bread
yeah recognize those
the green beans
and so that's he has food toys that he plays with at home
and the basket
sometimes kids have the exact sets
yeah it's funny it's not the exact it's like
oh this is kind of weird i guess this is tuna
it feels ah
don't touch
it feels a little weird
i don't know what this blob is
peanut
they usually say on the bottom so
oh the peanut
he did
here's a few animals
i um you know i noticed he's really into shoes
yes he's into shoes
when i say it's time to go bye byes he usually goes to get his shoes
is there anything that he usually does when he's playing that we didn't really see today
i don't think so
i mean he did his eye you know his eye stimming whatever it's called
oh you didn't see him with the cars
he has he plays with cars a lot
and he mostly pushes them behind
he's not so good at pushing forward
he pushes things behind
you try
oh
oh okay gotcha
so it's not a vocabulary expanding experience usually
right
yeah so that yeah he would definitely play with the cars at home that's one of his top choice
and the balls
so is there anything else that you wanted to tell me about his play
um just that well it has really improved over the past couple months
since o t has been doing sensory integration
and the joint compressions
i don't know if you're familiar with those
so that has really helped he was really stuck in his play
he would just push cars back and forth
and things behind him
and he wasn't really interactive with the toys
like he wasn't opening the doors or putting people in
he's he's getting better at that now
oh you popped them all
well putting in and dumping out that seems to be something that he's really interested in
and the stacking
he did well on that with you know the original assessment
so we're pleased that he's more interested in he's he has more of a variety of play now
repertoire yeah
now did you say that he had a speech therapist yet
yes yeah
she um she hasn't she's coming out more now
she she's going over the hanen hanen program
i wasn't sure how to spell it
h a n e n
are you familiar with that
no
the boo that's called
it takes two to talk
yes
and how follow their lead
with the play
and their sounds
now he's um and often kids are specialist with shh
yeah he likes that shh
and words that's often true that they will learn words that have the phonemes that they can do
and he really enjoys the shh
so he does shh sheep
yeah that's right and fish
and fish
and there's another one that starts with that
shh not ship
but you might try to give him more of those
that would be the easy way
and if there are other
does he do duck
just a little bit
he's just starting that one duck
have a sound that he has in another word it doesn't it doesn't hurt to help him
okay
because they may it naturally happens that way
yeah and he's good with the phoneme the b
b
you know yeah the baby
birdie
yeah bus
yeah and he says bah
ball balloon
yes we just like to ask parents questions about what they played with
right
things of that so um what did you play with first
so what did you show him
the cooking stuff i think
which kind of food
do you remember which kind of food he liked in particular
um he liked the he seemed to go for the textures so
the peas and
the tuna
all have that squishy kinda texture
yeah
tuna i didn't know what it was
um and like the oh he was using the spoons the the pots obviously
and the little stove top
does he have toy food at home
yeah
and that's his favorite
yeah he has li he has like a little play kitchen
yeah what kind of play foods does he have at home
um
things that we have here or
yeah
yeah similar
he has like little um fruits
and little meat things
um
he has a lot of utensils
so usually he'll just play with the utensils and the pots
and like have imaginary food in them
so yeah
um and i noticed he was cooking you a casserole
what all did he put in the casserole
he put cheese
tuna peas
pizza
and a peach i think
sounds yummy
yeah delightful
did he give you anything to drink with the casserole
yeah
he made me some tea
and when i told him it was too hot he added some cold water
that was nice of him
yes it was very nice of him
uh does he have any play animals at home
yeah that actually i'm surprised that he wasn't more into these
cause this is what his current like big hit
at the moment he's got probably two dozen of these little figurine
animals and he'll play with them forever
line them up
and but he he didn't even play here today like normally does
and i think it's just the timing
like cause is usually around twelve thirty
and he's just fading so
um
which animals did you show him
um
well i showed him the domestic ones the dog and cat
and the i tried to stick with the ones that he knew
like the monkey
the penguin the goat
um the pig
he likes farm animals
yeah that's mostly what he has is far well he has a combination of farm animals and wild animals
which is interesting when he puts them together
cause he's got like an elephant a tiger and a lion
but then cows and horses and sheep and that kinda thing
cow
yeah oh yeah he loves c he's really into cows right now
did you show him any of the dolls
i tried
but he he kinda backed away so i don't know if he was afra i don't i don't really know what was going on with that
but i didn't push it
um and he does have dolls at home
but they're like small baby dolls
that are don't look kind of as real
or if they look real they're they're different they're babies so
yeah he was showing no interest
so i didn't want to push it with him
were you surprised by any of the things he was interested in
um the i wasn't surprised that he was interested
surprised that i couldn't interest him in something i cou i was really surprised that he wasn't more into these
um
but you know i wasn't as surprised that he i mean
he plays with his baby doll at home o occasionaly
but for the most he ju he does his cooking and his and reading
um i was surprised that he didn't check out i mean good night moon is like one of his favorites but
so many things since he was sitting there
yeah or he like knows what that is already cause we have it but
this is all kind of new stuff
yeah
okay well let's find lisa and i think we just have a few more things to talk to you about
okay
my kids used to eat them frozen
i never enjoyed it
i have a video of my husband and i shooting peas across the table to to her oldest brother when he was one and hanging on the table in one of those chassi seats
and he was like stopping and smashing 
and we were having the best time and i look at that and i'm like
we were teaching him to play with food what were we thinking
oh
have a little fun
he loved those peas
i don't think he ate a single one
look at that cookie
look who's here woof-woof-woof
i see those
look here's a puppy
a puppy is a little dog
yeah
peas
very good
they're stuck together good job
say puppy
thank you
think she earned herself another one
hey look
oh you're take your shoes off
look
what i have
these are pajamas
yeah say pajamas
you've got your shoe
do you want some help
you do it yourself
you did it
good job
you took your shoe off
excellent job
look pajamas
wish you showed this much interest in at night
we've been fighting over pajamas lately
she used to wear blanket sleepers no problem
and now that its not really cold enough for that the other pajamas keep getting taken off or refused to be put on
ah
yeah its a problem that we need to solve
wow your tights are dirty
well it may be
um those are yesterday's tights cause we got we got up kinda early this morning for an oil change before coming here
so
okay i'm one thing shy of finished
okay
but there's your toe huh
did you tell me tree
say tree
i don't think you're gonna say tree for me
how house
where's you leg
i think you're busy with your legs
i think its easier if you put one leg in each pajama pant instead of both in the same one
yeah you're stuck
take it off you're stuck we need to try
here i got an idea
leave that one there and put this one in there
yeah good
push your leg in
yes
very very good
these are very cute pajamas
thank you doctor newman will be very pleased
my professors have been very excited about all of the toys
they spent a lot of time discussing which ones were ideal and
you completely want to get near pajamas
is that cause you're getting tired
yeah i'm kinda i'm kinda getting tired too
could you answer a couple more questions
and then um and then we can go take a nap
you and me both
life is good
oh here's a telephone
say telephone
yeah
here's a cup
say cup
say cup
do you know what
you know what
do you want help or do you want to do it yourself
you almost got it off
i bet those are hot
they could very well be which of course the problem with the blanket sleepers too
well we can just let her play whatever she wants to right now and just let me ask about the toys
okay sure
what things did she enjoy playing with today
well she obviously stayed with the food and the ice particularly long
and she got pretty excited about the tutu outfit
oh yeah
although she was attracted to this doll right away
i mean she started undressing her
but she played with her
i think she liked this doll
i mean that one obviously too
do you think she recognize it as a kid doll
not sure
not sure
what foods do you think she had seen before
oh um cheese pizza tunafish but come on
um ice corn on the cob this is definitely familiar
want me to try again
um let's see
and she'd seen peas before but again not often and peanut butter
this is the pan
and banana
and kiwi
no you do it
so she'd seen all those before
are there any that she likes to eat
um she likes she likes cheese we give it to her grated a lot though
so its not surprising that the cheese slice wouldn't look as appealing although she has had cheese slices too
um oh its plastic
um what else does she like in real life
well she does like ice
i'm not sure she's had an ice cone though
and she knew exactly what to do with one
yeah that's interesting
yeah maybe i've given her an ice cream cone before
you probably remember because the the
because the be mess
i've certainly let her eat mine so that's sort of the same thing
how about chili peppers
yeah she seemed very interested the chili peppers
i don't think she's ever seen them whole
i don't think she's ever seen whole even though they've been in food
yeah that's not real
and she didn't seem to recognize these which she likes more we have to hide those
oh thank you those aren't real
were there any things that you named for her
oh um that she didn't know before
let's see she knew t well the pepper
the pepper i named for her
and the beet
she's never heard of a beet before
that's a beet
cool huh
yeah but the rest of the stuff i did she knew before
does she have toys like these at home
she doesn't
but we shh we have a bible study friday nights where she plays in the um the toy kitchen there
so she has played with play food before even though she hasn't had it at home
it's be kind of fun to have at home
oh isn't that cute
we keep trying to rearranging the house trying to make a little more space
and well when our german foreign exchange student leaves there might be room for a toy kitchen
ah
she said yeah for awhile it was really really cute
you'd ask her a question she'd say yeah
what does she like to do with dolls
um dress and undress them
i mean i did this one just it was so tight
but um yeah she likes taking clothes on and off
i think that's the main thing
i've never seen her rock
or even try to feed
yeah the main thing is dressing and undressing
is there anything else she really likes to play with that we didn't see
she loves basketball
um basically anything you can push or pull
oh she just got a pink roller bag for her second birthday from grandma and grandpa and she pulls it with her everywhere
so she really liked that but even before the pulling was the pushing
she liked pushing her little tigger plane um and her s
its empty there's nothing in there
her scooter
she would push it when she wasn't riding it she'd just like push it around the living
um and of course she had one of those push toys to help learn how to walk that she was doing at six months was really outrageous
and she's continued to play with that as she got bigger but obviously not as much
um what else do you really like doing
trying to think going to the park but you're asking about toys
toys
was there anything here that you tried to get her interested in that didn't like
she didn't seem that interested in the farm animals at all
um the other thing she does a lot at home is um talk on the telephone which is frequently a calculator sometimes a cellphone occasionally a blush or an eyeshadow compact
she talks on the phone quites quite a bit
and she loves dancing
the questionaire asked um what her favorite video and its absolutely without a doubt sesame street dance along
oh wow
which is how she got herself signed up for a ballet because a lot of the songs on sesame street dance along have a good beat which she's loved forever
but there's one that's more elegant and she started doing this stuff completely unprompted
well i can't say completely unprompted obviously there's kids on the video doing slower moves too but she just caught on so fast
so she does she does like watching um watching and doing dancing
what about good night moon
good night moon was a favorite too yeah
she likes good night moon
she especially likes the three bears and their three chairs
ah
i'm not quite sure why that's a favorite page but it
honey
it isn't everybody who knows our farm book that was a terrific guess
yeah
yeah she i its funny i don't actually personally like margaret weiss brown stuff
but she does so there's obviously something about the rhythm that works
and it actually annoys my husband too he's like a quiet egg
and he hates reading her that book and he does it all the time its so funny when she brings it to him he's like
oh big red barn
he just doesn't like that book but he's really really good about it
well that's funny
by heart oh yeah
yeah with my second son it was um choochoo
the um ah see i can't believe its not playing in my head when i say that
oh my goodness i can't remember the author right now i can't tell you how many times i read that book
oh he loved that book
oh yeah
are you going on a trip
have a good time
she likes purses and she especially likes pink purses so i'm afraid she's a bit of a girly girl which i think we can handle
but she's a funny combination of very athletic
yeah
oh there are those babies
sure enough
here i can take this from you
okay
just a sec
okay
so what i wanna do is ask you some things about the toys
okay
here lets get you a
you can have a real chair
it's
and um
let me see
um which of these toys are kind of like things he has at home
ah
the animals
thus these like zoo
and the type to the little fake animals
um
and then pots and pans
we don't have toy ones
i just let him play with the the stuff that we have
i don't have special small
yeah
pots and pans
does he um
it seems like he enjoys cooking
yeah
we cook a lot
i mean he sometimes stirs
but i think most of the time it turns into a musical thing
cause he starts to he takes all the different pans
and he knows the different sounds each one makes
he likes the sounds
yeah
i noticed yeah
yeah
um
and then book and then books
but i don't have i don't have like fake food
i just
we play with food at home
food food
yeah
yeah we don't have any
the fake stuff
yeah
are there any of the things here that he eats in real life
um
i mean we've got i mean the bread
and the banana
the pizza
the green beans
the juice
anything that's a drink
um
cookies
cupcakes
birthday
yeah
the birthday
um
he might recognize peas
but he never eats them
i mean they just sit on his plate
um
ah what else do i see over there
soup
like the can
and things like that
we have that at home
he seems to really like to know good night moon
yeah
well we have the it's a different it's they're very similar
it's called good night moon one two three
and it's a counting book
so there's numbers
and it says like one whispering
whatever old lady whispering hush
so it's not the same book but her recognized the illustrations
yeah
does he um
does he have particular favorite things to look for in there
um
oh he looks at the balloon's probably his favorite
so the balloons
ah but he can he loves every to just pick out the things
i'd say all of them
the balloons though
he always goes to the balloons
is there anything here that you tried to get him interested in today that he just wasn't
um
i mean i would say normally
again he's just like at his breaking point
but i think normally i would've had a hard time with the babies
yeah
like he'll play with them for a little bit
and he's just sort of not interested
um
and i could see
the
i mean we didn't really get to all of it
like the
those stuffed animals like the zebra
and the sheep
i don't think he would really be
those are from a show that that i don't know
but i think it's a little creepy
when the legs come apart
yeah it's a little creepy
yeah
yeah
and he um
oh
careful
whoops
it's a slip
more goldfish thank you
that is fine jack
were there any animals here that you told him the names too
that were kinda new
new
um
i mean the peacock and the beaver
we have a couple at home
oh wow
and they have the ones that
yeah but they they're like more cartoonish
so i don't know if he
that was something i didn't think he was gonna know
if i yeah
cause it's not exactly the same
yeah
yeah
yeah
i mean like the zebra's something that i think you know he would know
it did
and the horse
but yeah the peacock and the beaver
um
even the fox
and the fox that was new
ah
um
and is there anything that he really likes to play that we really didn't have today
ah eh
period
in just in here or in general
in general i guess
um
i mean the the
i guess you had cars
he loves anything you can sit on and push
right
oh
that sorta thing
yeah
and he's getting in the whole bike thing
yeah
it's yeah
no we we don't have a lot of cars
it tends to be limited in verbal output
oh
it's more vroom vroom
oh okay okay
so
so
yeah but like car like things and different types of cars
like whether it's a police car
a firetruck
or a pick up truck
or a tractor
those are big
those are different yeah
and that's something we have a lot of at home
so he can
he knows like what each one does
and the sounds
that's what we think
i still can be driving all by myself
and go
look a back hoe
right right right
car transporter
my son is twelve
oh
i learned all those words
so
at when he was this age
yeah
yup
that's funny
um
i have
um
so we have got
a couple things we didn't do
okay
that i'd really like to do
okay
if you could come in again
it would be a quickie
um
okay
ah
we yeah we'd do that
as lon as it's pretty quick
cause i think at like in that first i dunno half an hour
i felt like he was really concentrating
he was more engaged yeah
yeah
and that that is true
well they're also a lower load
i have two things where i say
say dog
and um
they're probably about five minutes each
okay
and then i have then we'd i like to get another go at the story
which he might i think he would probably enjoy
if he were not at the end of his rope
yeah yeah no
he read we read a lot he likes me to read to him a lot
yeah
he says read read
he would do it a lot
so
it just wasn't good
you know
it wasn't the moment for it
he was already past
yeah
i think so
i think you're right
um
i also wanna ask what you think about um
when we go look at the mcdi
do you think that i was getting answers to thinks he really knew
that he wouldn't answer
or do you think i got about right
um
i think i'm sorry um
well i guess
do i think it was a basically a proper assessment of what he actually does
yeah
or do do you think that he's
i think it was less
i think it was a lot less than he would normally do
okay yes
cause like i said he was tired
so
when he would
you know when you were saying point at the ear
or point at the mouth
like
that's stuff he's known for a long time
yeah
so
well that's we have the mcdi as well
yeah
and there's a reason
cause they don't always
do the things they do at home with a strange lady in a strange room
yeah
yeah
so i think there was i think he didn't show as much
that he knows
yeah
so
ah
okay then
i have real quick
two permission slips
for the end of the study
and that's all i have for today
okay
um
you've been coming for over a year
to us
so he's really changed a lot
i know
in the
i think i noticed it the most with this
cause
with each questionnaire i felt like he wasn't
i mean he was changing
but
i think physically he was really changing but
yeah
the talking just flourished between eighteen and twenty four months
the language
yeah
in in fact
we're we're we're working on putting an another visit in
for later kids at eighteen months
oh okay
because it's such a change
yeah
and um about twelve
was it was it a year that we came the last oh
um twelve yeah
oh okay yeah
yeah so it's a
so it's been yeah
yup
even the
yeah i would say the eighteen to twenty four months
was like so much different
you know it it is
and the data points are so much like this
we'd like to see where
something in the middle is um
but all the time that you've been coming in
we've been recording him
and we've also been recording you
okay
and we don't talk about this at the beginning of the study
because sometimes people change what they're doing
but our study is looking at also how people speak to their young children
okay
and um
in particular we see interesting things with how well they enunciate a word
oh okay
you know so
and whether that tracks with exactly how old people start to do that
okay
because your seven month old
want some peas
and cheese sandwich
yeah
peas on your sandwich
wow look at that beautiful sandwich
yeah it's gonna be yummy
i wonder if the time that we do this
influences what they play with
if they what
oh time
the time thing
hey
not for not for actual eating
what
well he he enjoys playing
um
in his kitchen
yeah
what kinds of things does he like to do
i noticed that he's a got a lot of
cooking
ach actions
yeah
yeah so we play
we gotta gotta like
kuh
kid kraft kitchen set for
for christmas
so he likes to likes ta
do that
um
he cooks eggs
and he gets water out of the faucet
and brings me things and stirs things and
um
brings me more
he says more please
so i say more please
and um
jumping lots of jumping
lots of climbing
climbing climbing climbing
oh yeah yeah
just pretend please
yeah that makes
what um
what foods do you think that he knew
um
the cheese he definitely was like cheese
and the kiwi he knew
um
if he had played with the banana he would have known them
banana
um
peas he probably i mean he knows what peas are i
don't think he's a huge fan of them
um
and were there any ones you needed to tell him
the um
the peach
we haven't really
had peaches very much
so i don't think he knew much about the peach
and i'm i'm not really sure what that oniony thing is myself
haha
i think it's an oniony thing
haha
i think it's a beet
oh a beet
it could definitely be a beet
uh not alright
i don't think so
no
these
yes yes yes that's that was the those were main beets that we were
that we were playing with
i have pictures of him with
beet juice all down his
but it was like in his playroom for tomorrow he makes recipes with it
sure
and brings and brings things
and only he
yeah
oh that's our
woah
oh
what's she eating bobby
what's she got
oh dumping them out
oh my goodness
cool
are there any
things that you tried to get him interested in that he wasn't that he didn't like
well a well i mostly let him play with that one you saw with the
farm he wasn't so into the
into the farm thing
right now
i had i brought that out
i think i stopped at which of the animals did you play with
um
oh these
he got he he looked in the animals
and he pulled out the dolphin
he knows about dolphin
and then he pulled out the moose
an and i couldn't come up with noise a moose
makes
ha
so then
he didn't
pick out any other animals
haha
um so
it's peanut
o for pretend
it's not milk

um yes those are the only animals
and he didn't
he didn't play with the dolls
he does have
um
a couple babies at home
that um
that he'll
put to bed and
tuck in

no
no we di we didn't play with the dolls
um
are there any of these toys that look like something he'd have at home
well we have good night moon
we have some
kitcheny things
we don't have those soft things but we have
pots and pans and whisks and
some pla a little bit of mostly of play fruit
um
you've got a fruit and veggie
you're hungry
do you need some more um
crackers
i think we i think there's some more crackers
are they all gone
or are they here
is there anything else that he really likes to play at home that
we didn't see here
um
he just got for his birthday
and he lo it
i forget what they're called
they're these coo stacking
blocks they're
kind of like square
shaped things
twit
twiglets twig
tw
i don't remember
but they're they're stalking things to make towers
he likes to make towers
um
but they're cooler than blocks because they
sit
law sit on each other if you use the right shape on top of the other one
because it's
you know
graduated
sizes
just pretend please
um he got a camera for his birthday
he lo to press buttons
anything with buttons
press press press
ah
that's the other thing he loves
his buttons
but that sounds really cool
um if he can if he'll play
you wanna play with some animals
a little bit that's um that's fine
he can play
he can play with them but we cannot over talk each other
show sabrina that food
cool
what toys did he seem most interested in
um i mean the kitchen and the food probably
does he have that kind of toy at home
that that i that is a familiar toy for him
so that he has at home
and um i noticed he's got a lot of food playing routines
do you start cooking
yeah he has a kitchen at home so he knows
he starts with the food
and the
what kinds of things do you do
i mean he'll make i mean when we play with the kitchen usually it's him making food for me
so he'll put stuff in the pot and then give it to me to eat
and then put something else in the pot and give it to me to eat so
and he knows about the utensils too
i mean he has forks and knives and spoons in his kitchen at home so
he'll put it on a plate and give it to me
not usually he doesn't give me utensils to eat with but
ah well
um are there any foods here that are things that he actually eats at home
things he likes
i mean he eats peas
i he he definitely picked up things he's familiar with
he picked up the cupcake
he picked up cheese
um he wouldn't necessarily know what this was
oh and he called this melon
which he eats more than kiwi
so he would he wouldn't recognize a kiwi in it's whole state
yeah
uh
were there any other ones that you named that you um gave the name for
um
that were new
that were new
yeah
beets beets were pro new for him
but he wasn't that interested in them
mushroom he didn't know
ah
yeah i don't think he's seen whole mushrooms either
so
i don't think he's i don't know if he's ever eaten mushrooms
i don't know if we've given that to him
and he doesn't have a play mushroom or a play kiwi or
he has play peas
ah
but a lot of those things aren't necessarily in his food set at home
ah
he has a lot of fruits and vegetables spaghetti pizza
that kind of stuff
does he have any dolls to play with at home
he does not have dolls at home
cause he seemed interested in this one
and what did you decide it was
was it a baby or a
well i was calling it a boy
so he started calling it a boy
he was definitely following my lead on that one
ah
i just i always kinda wondered they work really hard to androgynous dolls
when you put the tutu on all bets are off
yeah
i should probably not start her out that way
it's a tutu you wanna put it on her
but he'll say like a little girl or a little boy
but for this one i think i named it before he did
so
and he was really interested in that mechanism
how the eyes opened and closed
yeah
that is cool
though when i layed him down and the the eyes were closed he didn't say he was sleeping
no he didn't want him to be sleeping
unhunh didn't want him to be sleeping
take it you know
well and he doesn't wanna be sleeping so
but like when we leave day
and if he's playing with something we'll very often put whatever it is to sleep to say good night to it
okay so he knows that one too
so he knows about putting things to sleep for pretend
ah
so
he he was just a champ about handing over those bubbles to the new kid
he's he's pretty good
the one like yesterday was his birthday
so we had um balloons
and the balloons star he was running around with them before the party and they started popping so i took them away from him and
he was not okay with that
when it's very highly preferred um he has a hard time letting go
but he was okay with the bubbles
saying goodbye to them so
it also seems like he's pretty interested in animals
he is he's interested in animals we do we have a lot of books with animals in them
yeah so we do a lot of you know animal sounds
he has all those like brown bear books and
you know that have different animals sounds
we definitely do animals a lot
yeah it seemed like owl was familiar
owl is um outside his day lady's house is a like a little owl statue so that is familiar
oh okay
um and the ele he definitely knew the elephant very quickly
i think he just kinda learned giraffe
he was wearing a shirt with a giraffe on it the other day
oh neat
um and monkey he knows but he didn't label it when i showed it to him
yeah
were there any of our other animals that you played with
i was pull i was pulling them up but he wasn't
you know we put a coup
like the zebra and he said for the zebra cause that what it happens in the book
aw
and the panda bear
but besides that he wasn't really into the animals
sabrina can you pass me the eel
and i pulled the i was looking for a fish cause he pulled this guy out
yeah
and that was the first one that i found
i think that it's just behind
no it's empty
there's just the one dolphin
and then we have the giant
the giant lobster crab thing
um is there anything that he really likes to to play with at home that we didn't really have a good representative of here
i mean at home he plays with the kitchen a lot
he's into like big play things right now
like ride on toys and trucks and things like that
what is that
it's a tree you're right
or we're playing outside a lot now that the weather's nice
so balls and
wow it's so pretty
at home he goes toward the like larger gross motor things
though i think at day he does a lot more like letter puzzles and things like that
oh he really likes the um that little stove
the stove
he likes he he's very into clocks
so he likes you know turning clocks around and making them like them ding or something like that
like he pointed at the clock when we
oo sorry
when we came in
are the eyes opening and closing
that's neat how they work huh
what does he what else does he do at home
the big trucks
blocks
a lot of the like big interlocking block type things
that makes perfect sense
and he he plays
like he likes to sweep and vacu
like he likes to play he likes to do the things that i'm doing at home so
ah
if i'm sweeping he has a little sweeper that he uses
he likes to vacuum
are you cutting that tree
wow
that is cool
his play
at this stage
he um came in he was so cute with the cups
and really the whole tea party
yeah
you can have it
yeah eat it up
that was fun
i guess when he first started he was tired huh
with with all this
yeah
yeah just wanted to sit
yeah
and you um were tired to get him interested in the book
does he like um books at home and reading
he generally likes to read them by himself
and in his crib
um he he doesn't like to hear all the words in the story
if it's more extensive than he has the patience for you know
so
go get it
so he'll uh he'll want to go at his own pace
so wi sometimes i just you know point out things and don't try to read it
that goes better and yeah
yeah that makes sense
so
yeah but he loves to si i mean he has he's go bo you know like board books in his crib that he sits and reads and reads
that that's doctor newman's we can't touch that
put the cracker here
or here charlie
okay
and then he got really interested in the tools huh
he just had his birthday
and he got tools for his birthday
and his brothers' are all into tools
oh does he have an older brother
yes
and he seemed to um he seemed to know his way around the screwdriver
to know what to do with it
he's been practicing with that
what um what else did he get for his birthday
um yeah
um he got a a birthday cake
like a wooden birthday cake set
with velcro he can put pieces together and cut it up
um
what else did you get for your birthday
his brother picked out a cars uh truck and s like truck and cars set
um
got some trains
what else did you get for your birthday
tend to get a lot of not a lot of
yes
yeah
and then um what else did you play with
he didn't really like the animals all that much
but you played with the puzzle for a while huh
it's not a a typical puzzle so i was wondering if he would be interested at all
you know there's no specific place to put the pieces
and whatever
but he didn't seem to want to do anything with that
they all had to go
nothing could stay
were those animals that you thought were familiar to him
no
no we haven't done much with ocean stuff
so i thought maybe that would make it more interesting
but not really
at least not right now
so which ones do you think you named for him for the first time
um i don't know that he's seen a shark
i think he's seen an octopus before
a tu a turtle would be uh one he would know
so i guess the shark would be a new one
these are the animals
yeah
we've been to the zoo yep
some his favorite videos have you know different animals that aren't you know wild animals
cool animals
but yeah
how about the um the more conventional ones
would he have see has he seen a real barn before or
yeah
yeah
yeah we just took a trip up to um lancaster county
and he learned horse and cow
he learned how to say them
while we were there and
lots of barns and trains and
oh that's nice
the trains are a huge draw huh
um and then he also um he has really lovely um cooking routines huh
yeah he has a he has a toy kitchen with food and cooking u utensils
and what not
and he loves to cook it's about most of um i'd say eighty percent of what he plays with
is the kitchen and cooking
and taking my pots and pans out and trying cook
all over the kitchen floor with
um does he ha so he has does he have a toy
he's got and he has toy utensils
yes
yes he does
so he must have tops on it
yes
it has to it has to go all together
it has to stack up and yeah
to blow when it's hot
yes
and what was he he had the spoon for a while
yep he likes to stir
cook it up
and also cut
yes
yeah but that's new with the toy he just got for his birthday
with the cutting the pieces of birthday cake
had the like a
a some kind of serving cutting thing
okay trash
how about toy food
oh yeah he has a whole bucket of a lot of them are similar
he has the pizza and the corn on the cob and
those are some of his favorite things to cook
oh thank you for putting the trash away
oh and the the vegetables did they come back from the bathroom
yes i put them in the basket
which are these things that he eats in real life
um well he doesn't have pizza because of the cheese
um so but he he cooks that
he loves corn on the cob
he eats peas
so he does he loves he does like to cook with those
of course banana
oh yeah
oh you're going to cook some more excuse me let me get out of the way
what kind of meat does he like
he likes chicken
every once in a while he'll ground beef sometimes you know a hamburger other times he can care less
would he recognize this
um he doesn't like it in the bun so he might he might not
i mean he might just pull it out
yeah
yeah he knows that
careful
and is there anything that he loves to play that we really didn't do
he he loves being outside and digging in the dirt
not one of my favorite activities but it's a big hit with them
um and climbing
you know climbing on chairs or playground equipment or whatever steps
oh the cars you found them
and is there anything here that you didn't play with
uh
i guess we didn't really play with the clothes but
does he have dolls
he has one
but it doesn't have multiple outfits
so he doesn't try and take it off
is it a big kid like ours
um it's not quite that big
it's more of a baby
yeah
but he likes to carry it around and strangle it by the neck
lovingly
yes of course
lovingly
yes
and he's been a really good also picker upper for us huh
yes we've been working hard on cleaning up
he falls and trips on toys a lot when they're just out
then he gets really upset
so we've we've trying to convince him that if he put them away he wouldn't trip
so we've been working on that
cause that was a motif all the way through our session
he did a lot of good cleaning up
oh tuna look
cut it that's good you can cut it
um do you have any questions for me about the stuff we've been doing
no
so what did what did she play with first
i think
and the food
yeah
and um does she have toys like this at home
she does we actually just got our kitchen the other day
so she's into that and my mom has this exact toy
um and we were there for two weeks over the summer
and she played with it a lot
and you know
would pots on it and put food in it and cook pasta and you know i don't know what she would she would make up when she was cooking but
um yes so she likes to play with those
were there any foods that shh were her special favorites
um i mean she went for the cupcakes
but no i mean at home she kinda goes for everything she goes for
we have some fake pancakes she goes for those a lot
um but here i wouldn't say anything in particular
and were there any foods that um she didn't know but you told her
uh she didn't know a kiwi
she's had kiwi but she doesn't really
eat it very much
not in the full way
i mean she's had it like that but she just we don't have it often
so i don't think she remembered it
and i didn't tell her what the beads were because i
she didn't seem to care so
ah
and then you played with the animals for awhile
yeah
um
she um
she knows some of the animals she was more interested in zipping these
she really liked zipping
these up and down
does she have um favorite animals
um
she likes to talk about goats we went to a farm over the summer and she got to hold a baby goat
ooh
so she likes to talk about that
i like that too
and we we have a picture and so sometimes she sees it and she says
i hold goat
so
aw
yeah she likes she likes to talk about goats
but um she knows a a lot of the you know the basic farm animals
she knows all of them
and um
were there any of our um our exotic animals that you played with today
um
we played with a octopus she knows what an octopus is
but she didn't recognize it she recognizes it in books
she thought this was a spider
well yeah
i mean eight you know eight legs so
yeah
um she called it a spider
and i told her it was an octopus but then she kind of ignored it
and what about these other guys
um i told her what they were but she like i said she was more interested in zipping
ah
than she was in playing with the animals
and did she like um like water animals and
um yeah
yeah we have books about under the sea and she likes to talk about you know the fish and the
shark she loves she watches nemo sometimes and her favorite part is this part the sharks
ooh
that's not what i would put on and you know but she likes the shark parts so
ah
she thinks bruce is funny
have you been to the aquarium yet
yes
we went to the um
one in georgia
ooh
the the one in atlanta is
amazing and she likes that
um i'm trying to think i don't think we've
brian took her to one my husband took her to one and
i think in the
early part of the summer
d you think there's a chance she's seen an eel then
sometimes they have
i don't know
she wouldn't remember it i don't think
although who knows she remembers things that i don't expect her to remember
so
and then um
and then you also played a little bit with the dolls
yeah
um
does she um does she have dolls at home
she does she likes to feed them and push them around in the stroller
and um she actually just got a changing set for one of them to out on new diapers and things like that
so she likes to help me do that
she cant quite get the clothes off yet and all
that but she likes to help with that
and yeah baby stella so
oh
that's a good name
yeah
but um does she like to dress and undress herself
um yeah she likes to be naked a lot of the t she doesn't take her clothes off a lot i mean she does it
she helps at night but
she kinda she likes to pick out her clothes but she doesn't always do the best job at pulling her pants up or you know pulling her shirt on and
she can go do her socks but
um and she likes to put shoes on
yes
those are very important
yeah so
and that was cute with the dance
oh she loves music
the we have raffi and i wrote on the thing that's what her favorite thing to listen to is but
a lot of his songs he has them participating so
that's the one that she likes to you know dance too
and its always mommy dance
daddy dance
you know she makes everybody dance with her
oo
and so
and there's a bunch of songs where they have motion so
oh that's neat
yeah
um is there anything she really loves to play at home that we didn't have at all here
um she really likes beads
which we already played with
um she's always asking to do her bead necklace
um and then we have a toy that's kind of like a light bright thing
if you remember the light brights and
i do but bigger
yeah yeah i mean they're they're like this you know they're about this size
and um you can do pictures from it but she usually just likes to use them plain but i mean its basically like popping them into a thing kind of like this
and it has four different colors
um there's three different colors i cant i cant remember and she likes
she will all the time just make lines of the different colors
and you know
now does she ask for it huh
um yes she's sort of picking up the tools yeah cause she likes
she does have a tool set she likes to put things in
um and like i said this was kind of reminiscent of that
that toy that she has
that she likes to play with
and yeah i thought that these were screws
that we're screwing but apparently there's no telling
yeah
and she'll have like a knot i think
yeah
yeah
that's what i was looking for but i didn't see them
so
cause i think these are just the bolts
and then the screw driver doesn't
i guess i could've turned that i didn't even test it
but if it won't stay in
yeah yeah
its kind of not as exciting is it
um
let me see uh is there anything that you wanna ask me
about what you've seen today
food back over there
hey guys
hi
wow
look at all that food
yum yum yum
wow you're really
beets
wow
thank you
too hot
that would be hot the stove
yeah
jennifer he can keep playing for a little bit
okay
yeah
we're gonna try to talk
we'll see how that goes
yeah
um
so what kinds of things did he like to play with today
um
the food stuff
he's he didn't really
i would say the food
that was really what got him kind of in involved
well that's interesting
um
yeah we have a play kitchen at home so i don't
sometimes it's like the novelty thing is the big thing and sometimes its the toys that what their familar with
but um
i couldn't really get him into the puzzles
he liked this
he didn't like putting on this apron
i mean or the uh t tool belt
put that on and he's like uh no
he didn't i mean it's not it's hardly restricting
he played with this a little bit
the tools with the screws
did ya
what were there any um foods that were particular favorites
um
the foods and stuff
no
well i don't know he just liked kind of exploring a little bit and
i think he likes the rubbery feel of these just that's something that we don't have
i don't know
i mean i think that was a texture thing it's not like he was drawn to green beans necessarily
ha
um
are are there any of those things that he eats
uh he eats the vegetables once in awhile but not as much as i'd like
um he liked the cupcakes
he seemed interested in this i don't know if it's because it's got the spiky
ya know
it's the radish or whatever
i don't know why that seemed to interest him
a little bit right there
i think it might be a beet
oh that is a beet
yeah
and he likes the spoons
he likes stirring stuff
does he cook at home
just pretend cook he's not really
can't quite figure out how to get him engaged
those are okay you can have those now lucas
are you serious
aren't you going to use them for another
no that's okay
okay
this is my main sticky
okay
turns out to be a stunningly successful technique
okay
um
love those things huh
so he likes to mix
and what kinds of cooking
what kinds of things does he do
um well i mean w what i do at home is i pretend ya know i say okay w here's what i want to eat like my daughter plays restaurant so then they both cook
and i'll say i'm really hungry for a juicy steak and mash potatoes and a salad and so they run over and bring me s stuff that looks nothing like ya know
i mean they might bring me and hammer and say here's your here's your steak
um um um
yeah
but um
now what do we have that's an omelette
i thought it was a skillet thing
or would you call that a pot
i don't know
i was thinking omelette
maybe that's what i'm hungry for
i don't know
i lets see it
oh this one doesn't have a cheat sheet on the bottom
oh
like a lot of em do
yeah
and
well unless you pop it out maybe
yeah
what kinds of food does he like to eat
he eats just about everything
i mean h he really eats
you like cheese
you like crackers
meat
um
right
peas
look what you did
it's the sticky thing
you took them off one by one
that was cool
did you play with our our dolls
he didn't
i tried to say that this was a doctor and he didn't really come over
to do a whole lot with that
although sometime
he really liked this purse
that little pink um that thing
that
it has a little
yeah
i think he saw that it was pink and he lo ya know
everything is really about his sister he's
i don't know why
yeah
and do you have any similar toys at home
we have a lot of pretend food
um we have some barnyard animals
lots of dolls
um
puzzles
yeah we have a little work bench
um
yeah i mean we have a ya know more of a kid sized pretend kitchen but
yeah
we don't have yeah
in word world i think is cool
he um
were there any things that he didn't that you had to tell him the names of
i guess i didn't really get into anything that i showed him some of the animals
like that he would know
i didn't really
like which ones
he didn't ask
ya know like i said this is a beaver
and
but he didn't really ask ya know what's this
i just i tend to tell him
what
what the objects are
and this is a book he knows
he does know that one yeah
we have it in spanish at home but it's pretty
how much spanish does he hear
my husband speaks only spanish to them
ah
so they understand it very well
um his pronunciation is pretty good
when you ask him to repeat something
um i e i you'll hea i mean when you know him you'll he'll he'll say un for a instead of like
he'll say un apple
so he'll use he'll mix the spanish article with the english word
has he um has your husband spoke spanish with them since th since he was born
yeah with both yeah
they've always like
they understand it but now my daughter is much more exposed to english because she's in kindergarten
so she's gone ya know eighty percent of the day or whatever
that figures out to
when he comes home
like sometimes she's getting a little frustrated at this point so we have to keep pushing it
cause if
you don't want to give up now
cause you really want them to know the language you gotta give it another two or three years and kinda get passed this point where she's saying i don't understand and she looks at me and says ya know what's he saying
and instead of me saying what he's saying he finds another word to explain what ya know what he's trying to get across what his point is
awesome
so at this point he understands i think
i think it is fifty fifty what he hears at home
um but with her now it's gone
much more english because she's not ya know she's gone for most of the day
well that's great though
they're getting it and it's and they're her pronunciation is still better than mine because i didn't start until i was in eighth grade
so you know they get it they hear it
it's amazing
so
right lucas
what
rug
i don't think so
but i do wanna ask you some quick questions
okay
about her playing
what of these toys does she have at home
lots of babydolls
she's pretty obsessed with babydolls in general
um dressing them doing everything with them every day
um food we have some food but she does a lot of my husband cooks a lot so she's usually in the kitchen with him cooking
so i thinks she likes that whole cooking part of it um
we don't have any of these at home but she did kind of like the animals
we don't really have a lot of little animals
kinda thing
but she goes to daycare during the week so i'm sure they have some of those things also at daycare
yeah that makes sense
so i'm sure they have a lot of the same kinda similar similar stuff
i thought the book she was gonna grab
is usually her favorite book at home to read
ah
she likes the kittycats in that book
oh yeah
and the mouse
she likes to find what page has the two kittycats and the mouse on it
but um she's usually pretty content with playing the same thing for a pretty long attention span wise
she's focused
yeah i mean she can do the same usually activity for a pretty long time
she seems pretty interested in um the dolls dressing
dressing babies and shoes and
other than talking a lot about babies lately
oh i would guess
so
so that might play a part on it but
and the do her own dolls have clothes
yeah they all have clothes and she likes to change their diapers
and put their clothes on
and she knew this huh
she has one of those
well one for her not a baby size one but
she likes to play dressup at home
that's one
dresses and tutus
cool
that is neat
but yeah babydolls i'd say is probably her favorite activity
she recognized this too right away huh
the purse
oh that she usually take my purses and she'll put on her arm and say byebye
like she's walkin out
you know i think it's a little
a li backpack
yeah
kind of
not very ergonomic
but she usually associates with going byebye
if she ever sees a bag or a purse
yeah
she thinks she's leaving the house
yeah
does she have any animals or particular favorites of hers
um
i mean babies are definitely her favorite
she has a couple stuffed animals and stuff but
not as much as i'd say babydolls
is is she like into cows or
um more doggies
oh yeah
a lot of doggies
um
we have elephant doggie
which of ours
what did she particularly play with
she had one way over there
and here was the duck
the duck and the pig
ah
and the bears
bears she's
big on bears lately
i think they've been doing some bear talk in school
ah
it's been a bear week this week
yeah
and i noticed too that she knows she knows a lot of things to do
in the kitchen
yeah i think she does watch a lot like my husband usually puts her up on the counter with him as he cooks kind of shows her
she's she's got techniques too
yeah and he likes to talk her through all the cooking
you and daddy cook
i don't really cook much so
it's a nice um it's a nice play repertoire that she can put it in the pot
stir it up
yeah
take it out
and then finish it and then go
oh yeah you blow on it s when it's hot
and then
and then after that eat
so that ends up you know like long
and complicated
yeah
it's just interesting to see
were there any of these f
don't eat it
that was just pretend
just pretend
um
i don't know if she liked the squishy ones just because of the feeling of 
but she really does like a lot of green vegetables
she likes peas and beans
and all that but i don't know if it was just
and cheese
but i don't know if it's squishy or just because she recognized it
ah
and what about the sweet stuff like that
um she doesn't eat too many sweet things to be honest but like the juice
she recognized that as a
like she was she thought she was getting a cup of juice
options
she thought it might have been real at first but
but even like all the cans at home she'll take out of the pantry and line cans up and stack cans and
she does like playing with cans she and her cousins
especially in my parent's pantry they they line all up in the pantry
oh that's neat
right megan
what about like what else
what else do you have over here the pizza
tryin pick out of there
oh don't eat it
that's pretend honey
ah you like stir
was there anything that you tried to get her interested in playing with but she just wasn't gonna go for it
guess i didn't really get too much to this stuff
um
no i mean most of these we've kind of show to her she kinda takes interest
at first
and then i know she definitely want it at all
yeah
she didn't want that on
not really sure why i guess she just wanted to see everything in there
oh that makes sense
just pretend
that's not real cheese
is there anything that she usually plays that we didn't really see today
um we do a lot of puzzles at home
but i know she did some puzzles that one earlier but she does
so she likes puzzles
she does a lot of puzzles and a lot of
my mom her grandmother has like a lot of flashcards that she likes to match the flashcards
yeah just the little things we used to do one at a time
yeah
yeah she does a lot of puzzles
she looked ready to though
take it right then
yeah
yeah she's really she's pretty good at puzzles i'd say
um
yeah and i know at i mean at school they do a lot of like song playing and group activities and that kinda stuff
this is true
as far as like lining up and you know sitting at a table and doing different activities together
well she seems very susceptible to big girl at the table position
i think they must a lot of sitting in chairs and doing table work at school
yeah
she seems to always want to sit
that yeah
and she'll tell us at home mommy's chair daddy's chair megan's chair
oh really
tell us where to sit
you need order in your world
yeah
she's very orderly
yeah
yeah she does like to clean up which is nice
sometimes
some things she likes to clean right megan
pretty far actually almost done
what do you say megan
you say please
and she does like to i noticed that she was tryin to put she likes to do things herself but then she gets she does get frustrated and she'll say help a lot she's kind of learned the whole help mommy help
yeah
but i think she tries to do little thing that she does get frustrated easily at times
wanna put your shoe
she knows exactly how to ask
this one
good job
that's right
sometimes she has that little she's in that stranger anxiety
right now a little bit when when go places
that two year old age
that's why we have a she has a cousin who's three weeks younger
and we always noted my sister and i that she he's not very verbal at all
so we always talk about if wonder it's like boys or girls or if one sex is more verbal than the others
she has a lot of words
vocabulary
to play with huh
yeah well you know who you know what
let's see
i take it that jennifer is hungry
can you get her some food
yeah here get some food for jennifer
are you hungry jennifer
oh good
she's hungry
good here
see if she likes these
yeah
cut a piece of banana
so as long as you don't overtalk you can play with her
yes
she's fast
i mean she's delightful
what
and um such a good cooperator
she is she's pretty good yeah
um and she well you guys played with a lot of things too
yeah
now what did you play with first
we played with the um animals first
and then we kinda went over to the doll lost interest in the doll real fast
you had a lot of different animals out huh
yeah
now were there any that um you feel like she saw for the first time today
maybe like the warthog
yeah that one was a new one i was like
but uh she's she's a huge fan of zebras right now zebras are she likes zebras
yeah i see he remained part of the play
yeah
yeah that was a little weird because i know i was like where's so she was not as interested in this one as the other zebra
yeah his his other i guess it all connects the right way
yeah and then the tail is at the very end
yeah it's kind of a weird looking zebra
yeah
also not right
yeah
oh well
it's a little bizarre
but um we have kids who go like oh yes the word zebra
you cooking for us
it seemed also like she had a pretty good idea of where different animals go
yeah she she likes animals i mean she's always been a huge fan of animals more than like dolls or other things
and you started with what you're kind of all messed up huh
yeah
what did you find that were was wrong
she um she wasn't a huge fan of the octopus
yeah
octopus
they are interesting
yeah
she didn't really like the octopus too much
and then yeah she went to the dolls a little bit
tried to put shoes on the doll and she didn't she decided she was too big yeah
but she recognized that dance outfit huh
yeah she likes tutus we have uh two tutus
sometimes we have to just say the tutu just is inside she can't wear the tutu outside
yeah yeah
yeah
there are certain things that she loves so much like that that's for inside
like her whale pajamas they they stay inside
if she had her way they would go outside a lot
yeah
and my guess is that she has this at home
yeah yeah she likes she likes good night moon
she said she wasn't she was like reading it today
and what kind of food was he gonna get
oh was getting just about anything in there you got some peas i think we were just going through the top of like whatever was there pulling things out one at a time
were there any foods that you thought were like foods she eats at home
um i mean she eats bananas and she eats pizza she thought this was pizza she eats pizza what else
the on the pear yeah
that was one she wanted to cut up for the zebra
and the spoon and the yogurt been a big deal recently as she's gettin better with the spoon she's kinda again yeah so i think that's why she's been on that spoon
not lettin go of the spoon
well that makes sense
does she have play food at home
she doesn't really have play food at home
but at daycare i think she no wait she does have some some fruit yeah she does have fruit play fruit at home
yeah yes we do have some play fruit forgot about that
i think at her day they have more food
it was nice to see too she has a lot of cooking routines
toys
she knows what she's going to do with it
that it isn't just food eat that it has to be cut and cooked and that you need tools so that was fun to see
was there anything you tried to play with and she was just like eh i'm not interested in it
well i mean she really wasn't interested in good night moon she wasn't interested in the the zebra parts
she liked the she liked the front of it the the other parts of the zebra not not a fan of
not so much
not so much
and the magnets not really
is there anything that she usually plays a lot at home that we didn't really see today
um she ha loves letters like we have these little letter alphabet things and she loves playing with them just
magnets
magnets
everywhere yeah
and then they they you know she'll put in a bag and she'll carry them around then she'll take out and then she'll put back in and and she does like to draw with crayons we've already kind of done that
yeah
she likes she likes crayons a lot
yeah the letters she loves letters
neat
yeah
there was an o
an o yeah anything that's circle is an o
you know i wanted to ask too i had a question about the computer
on the test did you i my ear i didn't think she said it but i wasn't sure
i don't think she said it and when she says computer it's more like like when she says it at home it sounds almost like pear
that makes sense
yeah
and i'm like is it why does she think it's like a i don't know
it's well you know it's three syllables it's hard
yeah
i don't think she i don't think she said computer
i would be surprised if she said
okay i just wanted to check because with the two year olds the articulation it's hard to quickly enough sometimes
well let me see
are you going around
she just she how does she feel about the playground
oh she likes she likes the playground she loves playground down the slide slide down
she gets a quite upset if we're walking around the neighborhood and we don't go towards the park
there'll be a minor meltdown then we have to convince her that we can work we'll go later
yeah
she she'll go down the swing but she's not as she likes to climb up things and she recently fell off the slide so she'll want so she'll want to slide down with you now she you know she fell off she hit her head
yeah exactly
but she does like to climb up stuff
and she'll go on the swing for a little bit but she doesn't like she likes more just you know the going up things and sticking her head in things
and is it true that she likes to swim
like she swim she likes the bath i mean i don't maybe she thinks that's what it is
ah
she really hasn't i wouldn't say she's actually really done any swimming yet
swimming but we do splash you in the bathtub
yeah
ooh yeah no be careful
can you take off
yeah we're going to clean up in an little
don't you love that
that's like when he falls asleep and i'm like okay you know i'm going to go to sleep boom
wakes up
instantly
i think he'll be pretty quiet for you
i think he will
after that nice nap
what do you see up there you lookin at the plant
okay
um
so can you tell me about some of the um what you played with today
um
played a lot with the food
um a lot with the food
um
a little bit with animals
but uh
did he seem to have any favorites with the food
um cooking
on the stove
anything he can cook
do you ever let him help you out at home
yes
he cooks at home
he even actually on the hot stove he turns pancakes and everything
and he has his own kitchen in the basement and uh
he cooks and cooks and brings you things
brings you hotdogs and
picks it up with the tongs
real stuff
he likes
no
just like uh
that's in the play kitchen
what like this
yeah
okay
and then he is allowed to he does help in the kitchen actually
supervised
yeah
did you see any favorite um foods here
uh
for some reason he liked the sushi
which he has no clue what sushi is
he liked the sushi and
the burger
and using the spoon to move things
around
um and of course the ice
yep
very popular is ice
he did look a little bit at the animals
um he thought the one thing was a puzzle the magnet board was a puzzle and when he found out it wasn't he didn't care
yeah
and he named the he liked the fish on the fish little box he likes nemo
it's his favorite movie
yeah he seemed to know a lot of the underwater animals
yeah
so has he seen any of those in real life
like
yes
we um
not the aquarium around here but them um maryland zoo
they have a little aquarium he goes to and when we're in florida we go to moat marine
um he's been to sea world twice
so he's fed dolphins and stuff so yeah
wow
he likes sea life
yeah he seemed to know the names of all of them
yeah
he actually knows seahorse and starfish
and all that stuff so
poor thing probably getting so bored
i know he's like same beige walls
um
were there any animals he hadn't seen before do you think
there were lots of those animals he hadn't seen when i surprise he wasn't interested in like
at least i mean he's never seen a wildebeest before
he's probably seen a peacock on tv but
but there's lots of animals in there that we don't have ones at home or anything but he still
he was really into cooking
this time
is that something different from past
you know i think last time he was in we there wasn't the little stove last time but i think he predominantly played with the food last time as well
and
it's really i think almost all the times he's been very interested in food and little bit
an like there were stuffed animals before that he would look at too but
he's very into food
maybe he'll be a little chef
i know maybe my little le cordon
um were there any foods that maybe like you've eaten before that he knew the names of
um
well he's had the pizza the burger
hotdog
kiwi i've eaten and he thought that was fu he kept saying that over and over again i think he liked to say it
and the ice
greenbeans
i can't get him to eat 
oh yeah you said he doesn't like vegetables
none of them do
all of my boys
eventually
yeah
when he grows up
he liked the uh
the cheese he said cheese
when he saw the cheese
this is gonna be a great recording with the baby crying over it
tryin to think if there's anything different there he has
the biggest thing was the kiwi he's never seen or heard me say before i don't think and he thought was fun
so i'll have to go buy him some kiwi
yeah i think they're fuzzy it's kinda like what is this
sometimes the peach too they're like
yeah he picked it up right at the end he just called it a ball
yup
i think they usually go yeah call it a ball or a apple
yeah apple
um
what about
i don't think
he didn't go anywhere near the doll
yeah
and he never goes near dolls
uh we go down to friend's house it has a bunch of girls and
he they does not play with dolls
nope
and there was one time we were down here he was interested and he wanted to pretend to feed the doll but this time he could care less
yeah
he had no interest in the dolls or the clothes
or the book
which at homes he does like books a lot i read lots of books
but
the kitchen was way too much fun
yes
yeah i think since it's new
and you said he does have a stove like this at home
he does have a stove at home
yeah
yeah maybe he just
it's familiar
it's his
yeah
he's used to it
um
lemme see
was there anything um
else that you tried to get him to do that he didn't seem interested in
i tried to get him to play with the animals
yeah
and he just
and to do the magnet board
and he wasn't interested at all in either
oh he did like playing with the um
like with the belt like the toolbelt and all that stuff
oh that's right
duh completely forgot about that yeah the tool stuff
he just got a tool bench for christmas
but he's always loved
uh like playing with screwdrivers and hammers and stuff like that
that's why i had to buy him fake ones
yeah definitely
does he see his dad do
yeah
he sees my dad his grandpa do it all the time and he is forever in there
so he likes that
he likes to play with screwdrivers and
and try to turn he'll shove a screwdriver into everything
yeah he was pretty good at it
yeah
you can tell he's done that before
yeah some of them don't really know what to do and he i think he was trying to put um what was it the cupcakes or whatever
oh yeah he did the muffins
he called them muffins which i've never heard him say muffin before
really
that's so funny
they're cupcakes at home
so it was inter i thought it was really interesting he called muffins
and he wanted to put in the muffin tin
yeah
and then he tried
then he tried to put it in the wood board
hole won't fit
i'll stand up
maybe if i stand up he'll shush
yeah i forgot yeah he liked the muffin tin that was fun
and he liked
putting the juice little plastic containers of juice lining those up on the
top of the stove
yup
yeah he seemed to like these
what else
i think a lot of kids like these more you know the other toys are more soft and kind of for more babies i think yeah these are the cool new
yeah new thing
new toys
and he's always been
i call him a process child he likes doing processes of doing things
like he likes to put stuff on the stove
pretend to cook it take it off
likes the screwdrivers turning
likes actions
yeah he really liked those blocks today
yeah he liked he loved putting those beads on like i couldn't get away from him after
oh gosh
but that was good yeah he he has good fine motor skills
yeah because of doin that he loves to do that
yeah
that was really good
kinda tell me like what did you see her playing with first really
um she started playing with the animals until you brought out the kitchen stuff
yeah she really seemed to like that
yeah
um we have play kitchen stuff at home
and whenever she goes to other kids' houses the minute she sees like play food and like a kitchen set she goes nuts
so
are does um any of the food here does she have that at home as well
um she has like corn
like the plastic fruits and vegetables and
um she has like some of the little pots and pans and stuff like that
okay
um was there any food that she like maybe had never seen before
or don't have at home that she seemed to like
um probably like the little cupcakes
she was playin with those at first
and the little pizza
um we don't have anything like that at home
okay
so
and she really seemed to like to make the cupcakes
yeah
does she watch you in the kitchen at all or
yeah
yeah
yeah
she like kinda like play along
yeah
she definitely likes likes the kitchen
um were any of the foods uh things that she actually eats in real life
i mean
um yeah like
we have um
i mean she's pretty had pretty much all of it
um lot of the fruits and vegetables
she has had cupcakes and cake
and um cookies and pizza and stuff like that
okay
um and so what el what else does she seem to like to play with
um she liked to feed the babies too
she was giving them juice and stuff
um but
does she does she have some of those babies at home
um yeah she does
she uh has
uhoh
are you
goodness
too many toys
oh you got juice yeah
um she has like similar baby dolls at home that
she'll put to sleep and rock and feed them too so
does she ever do any like the dress up like you guys were doing
um she does with her barbies
or she tries and then when it fails she asks me to
yeah
but um she tries to dress as much as she can
yeah does she have anything she likes to dress as
um she just has regular old barbie dresses
yeah
alright
um what about the animals
so shh she played with them a little bit right
yeah
yeah
um like the ones she recognized she was namin
like the peacock
she calls it a peapock though
and um like the pig
she didn't really play with the pig as much but
i mean i don know
yeah
um so were there any animals she didn't really recognize that you know maybe she saw for the first time
there are a few in here that i don't think i've ever mentioned or she's never really come in contact with so
okay
um but she either skipped over them or
i didn't
the zebra she's kinda seen like maybe once or twice and i tried to get her to say it or look at it and she wasn't really havin it
she was playing with the kitchen stuff
yeah she definitely really liked the kitchen stuff
yeah
we do have some strange animals here and
um did you notice i mea anything about her play today that was kinda typical or different from what she does or
um it's pretty much typical
yeah
um she usually either plays with barbie or kitchen stuff at home when she's playing
yeah
and um she with the kitchen stuff she'll put stuff in her pots and pans and mix it up and she'll say she's makin me breakfast or lunch or dinner
um and then she usually has me pretend to eat it or she'll feed it to like one of her baby dolls
yeah
so
okay
um anything is anything he uh that you usually play at home that we didn't have here
um she
or is it mostly
it's mostly here um
um she has like a doll house that she usually plays with um
her barbies have like cars and stuff like that
um like baby strollers
like some of the bigger stuff
um but she usually plays with that kinda stuff at home
okay
good yeah
she uh like i said she loves that kitchen stuff doesn't she
i can tell she plays with that a lot
yeah
yeah
alright well we can start uh start putting this stuff away
where do you want me to set this
oh you can just put it down on the ground is fine
you can eat whenever you like
yeah i guess we'd like to um
look at what they enjoyed playing with now that they're almost two
oh goodness
do you want to show
go show her
can i see
what's that
can you bring it over here
can you show her
um so what did he enjoy playing with
today
he still loves to cook
we've been enjoying cooking for a very long time
yes
so um that seems to always captivate him
did he have any does he have any favorite food items
everything is in storage
oh
food items here
yeah
oh you know
i was thinking anything that fit in the pot um
and didn't seem to be limited as long as it would fit with something else so
i can't say that we have a favorite
what are the things that he has copies of himself
we have a donut and a piece of pizza and green beans
and a hot dog
cheese
yes
look she's got eyes
um and of course the cups and pans and
a little oven
which of these does he eat in real life
cheese
he loves cheese
and green beans
and um i am told that he eats hot dogs at the day care
and um that's probably about it
some some ice cream
but for the most part it's noodles and uh nothing is you know looking like the noodles he eats anyway
yeah
he has nice cooking play routines
he knows he knows what to do with the food and he knows that it's hot
yes
and that was neat
he spends a lot of time in the kitchen watching
yeah and i see that he knows about pouring and
yes he helps
i am he has his own i take a set or he takes things out of the cupboards and does it as i'm doing it and i talk with him and sometimes i'll let him stir it
so
he's good at mixing too
yes he's a very good stirrer
and he seems to have a really healthy respect for hot
he does
um and it didn't take much
um it was just overly warm food
that's all it took
and he has a deep respect
my husband's very sensitive to heat and i think he must have gotten that too
so
ah that makes sense
and then um he seemed to really like the animals
we're big animal fans
um anything that's an animal is fascinating to him and so the zoo before we melted down was fun
um of course the dog and the cat and all the ducks on the pond and the bunnies in the backyard he just absolutely has a
oh it is
it's her shoe
her shoe
very good
yeah just like that one
um so animals have been i i can't even say that i encourage anything
he has discovered his own likes and dislikes and then we pursue it from there
and he really seemed interested in all the birds
he really enjoys the um the ducks in the pond across the street and i think has developed a fascination from there
um so yeah it does seem to come from his environment
that piece at least i assume
are any of these names new to him
um
that you told him in this play session
yes
lemur um
where adult birdies kind of disappeared
oh from the birds
yeah
let's see
from the birds
the birds he's all heard before
it was the other animals that he hadn't
there was a couple of african ones that we haven't gone across before
yeah all the birds he's encountered
and is there anything that you kind of tried to get him interested in here but he didn't really want to do
no he seemed to even if i didn't um even if i brought it out and he turned his attention away he came back to it
i think like the animals
so yeah eveything he seemed to and i was surprised that he was interested i was just curious to see if he would dress a doll
um and i was surprised to see that he did so
and again at day care there are girls and boys and i think that they obviously interplay and um he's not
i guess we just he's never we've had dolls in the house he's just never gleamed onto them and tried to do anything with them before so
and then did he i'm looking for did he play with our our letter
animals
we've got a bee and what else
yeah the the zebra
um very briefly but it was after i think you and i cut off and he started to show me part of the zebra
i think they're creepy
really
i do
i don't like that their body parts come off
you're right segmented is a little weird
that's funny
but you know
i guess that's what we've got
oh and it took us a while but we did get some
yeah the
yeah
which is you know
good job
he can just stay there or leave the room
oh
i don't know
if you can see doesn't matter
well you know what
he probably wants to be with me
yeah
he good where he is
so let's just we'll just leave him here and i'll talk a little about um
do you still want me to wear this
yeah
okay
okay you guys pretty much started with the book huh
yes
um
i think he was playing with that first maybe but
oh
we quickly went to the book
i think
uh not a scone
that was a donut
yeah um and so is this a book that you have at home
we do yes
um we haven't read it in quite awhile it was my other son's favorite book but um
they've moved on since my son is older
yeah
he usually gets the choice
you know he has a book he just really wants read
so asher's sorta just along for the ride
ah
um but he seems like he really knows it
yeah i mean he knows it uh
not as i mean yeah
we don't read it a lot but he does
does he have favorite pictures
yeah um in certain books
no i meant in good night actually
oh
the moon and the stars are his favorite
the moon mostly
he's really into the moon
ah
in every way
yeah i noticed that's one of the things he picked out in the other book too
oh okay yeah he
he's a fanatic about the moon
we have lots of books on the universe and that's what he likes to point out in all the books
ah
that makes sense
and then um
he also um did a little bit of cooking
he seems tired
yeah he you know he woke up early this morning
uh he usually sleeps in two to three more hours but he actually got up at seven fifteen as opposed to ten
we're sorry
oh no that's fine my other son wakes up at that time so
daddy five ten
was there anything that you tried to get him interested in playing with but he didn't want to
uh the dolls i guess
well he wanted a baby
there's a babydoll he likes to play with
at a place that i sometimes work at
and um he likes to change it's clothes and stuff but
oh that's nice
he wasn't interested in the older ones
and that's interesting we have a number of them who just decide these are babies
because they would like to play with them
are there any toys here that are similar to what you have
at home
melissa and doug stuff
we have a lot of
stuff similar to that
um
and the book and then he plays with this stuff um where i work occasionally
i work at truxton park uh rec center
if you're familiar
uh i'm not
in annapolis actually i'm sorry i'm like thinking this is annapolis
okay
um
and i i work in the kids' zone
it's like where the kids play while the parents are working out
oh
and it's a really big room
and it has a kitchen area to it and he likes to play in that
so that's it going with mom a really good thing
yeah he loves it
so i bet you don't have so many um you don't have kitchen toys at home
no no we don't uh have any
actually we don't have a lot of this stuff at the place i work
this is all pretty much different
kinds of foods and stuff i mean we have this you know
and this
were there um other foods which ones does he eat
um he eats hotdogs he usually eats tofu or turkey dogs
um
corn
um
bananas
a pizza
um
greenbeans
peas
kiwi
um
lots of fruits uh
i mean pear when they were in season
cupcakes i mean
orange juice
yeah
since they just had birthdays a lot of the twos have very vivid cupcake
he um
he played with this
yeah he thought the uh donut was a scone because when mommy goes to starbucks i get him a little scone
ah
you know he did start out with these didn't he
and he seemed real interested
i was i don't think i was really paying attention when he was doing that
um i was trying to get him into it
and he wasn't he was already he had already moved onto the dolls
i don't know was he playing with that at sometime
i thought he put them all in
he may have i just wasn't payin attention
and he was sure interested in the nut and bolts that was fun to see
oh yeah yeah
where did it go i don't know i see it
ooh
it's hiding
in the basket
it's in the basket
he did you know what he didn't play with the animals at all
yeah he wasn't really interested in those
no does he have any favorites
in animals
uh
no
really no
i'm trying to think
stuffed toys
turtles
he likes turtles
um
does he
crabs
um
well that's very cuddly
well maryland crabs everywhere we go
yeah
but we live on the bay so we go and look at crabs in the water all the time
so
um not really he's really into pumpkins
so
oh
oh thank you
oh that's somethin yucky
thanks
they look delicious
i make him um from the sneaky chef
cupcake brownies that have spinach and blueberries in them
ah
and they look really dark like this
and it seems like you have really nice healthy food
um we try you know
my not always successful
my older one he eats really well
he you know he's not picky like my older one is so
it's harder to get my older one to eat well
thank you baby
aw
uh he really likes dogs and cats
yeah
yeah yeah
if he hears a dog he gets really excited you know he'll say doggie you know
um
cats you know he'll be like kitty cat you know and he'll try to run up to it
so i'd say dogs and cats are his favorite
does he have a teddybear
no neither of my kids have been into stuffed animals at all

uh
uhoh elise can you come here and give him a hand
asher the baby

maybe get out one of the bins since he likes to dump the babies in there
honey hey asher
can you please help clean up sweetie
thank you good job
uh blocks he likes to play with blocks um he likes to uh put the shapes in the places they belong
shape sorters
yeah
um
and then are there any questions you have about the things we've done today
no
um he's developmentally he um he seems to me like he's normal but um
i think because he's so attached to me i'm a stay at home mom
um that he doesn't quite have the social skills as much as the next kid who's in a daycare setting
but he is very he is actually very social
but um
i've seen other kids that can just their parents can leave and they're fine with it you know at his age but he's not he i have to be with him
kids are different
yeah
and i don't know if that's a developmental thing
well yeah
i think that that's that could be a temperament or
that's true
it could be love or it could be
yeah
i mean i don't mean it to say that he i don't think he's slow or anything i just think that um
yeah
because he has the advantage of having mommy around he
i don't know if um
a lot of the questions on the questionnaire are like does he talk like everyone else you know and i don't really have much to compare it by
well i think that you know multiple families are in the same boat you know they'll be like my sister's kid and when they were one
well you look at girls and they're like worlds apart
always
i had my boy first which i think was a great advantage
because my parenting improved
and my friend who did the other was like well this one's clearly broken
yeah i have heard that
i've had friends they're like my daughter was already potty trained and this and that i'm like there's a two year difference okay
girls are very much more mature
it comes out in wash too
yeah
well you know gross motor skills with boys come first and then girls are more verbal
oh
you know what let's go get your brother
asher what do you think of that
it's time to get your brother

as far as manipulatives go he has farm animal
so he's he's got a pig and a

but he recognized
which one was it

um
was it the shh
i know he said the sheep he said the pig
um he called something an eagle but it wasn't an eagle
ah
um

he he does like ta look at pictures of animals and name animals and play with animals
he's a good age for the zoo
yeah yes and he loves um he's been to a lot of petting farms and things like that and he's ridden a horse so he likes to do those things
were there any that you named for him today that you thought were new
new
um the peacock was new for him i know he hasn't seen that
um
trying to think what else was new
that he hadn't seen
i think it was the just the peacock maybe that he hadn't seen before
ah
and he has just beautiful ya know pretend play with the animals
yeah he likes the
they have very rich lives
right
yeah
he can do he can sit with his animals probably ya know like for twenty minutes and just walk them around and have them talk
well they eat and they sleep and they have relationships
they yup
yes
they have full lives
that's really neat to see
and then after that you were you you played more with the cooking toys
the cooking toys
now he doesn't have this kind of stuff at home
um i think he has it at his uh it's at the babysitters but um he doesn't have it at home
um so that that's kinda new for him ta
does does he go in the kitchen with you
yeah he'll go in the kitchen and he'll take out pots and pans and things th
cause he's got really he also knows what to do with them
yes yeah
cause he does watch in the kitchen he he likes to watch
and he likes to help ya know if i'm making something he likes to pour
put stuff in and he does like to do that
yeah
were there any foods that h um were foods that he eats at home
um he eats peas but he calls them balls
oh
um
and he'll eat pizza he won't eat greenbeans
he's never seen beets before
that i know o
oh no he has i thi he's seen them but i don't think he's uh i know he hasn't eaten them
um icecream
he loves ice cream so that's a food that um he's familiar with
cupcakes at birthdays and things like that he's he's seen those
and he knows to um to cook them
yeah
he's knows to s you know
and that things get hot and
and and what to do
what to do if they're too hot yes
yeah blowing is a is a fun thing at this age too
thing at this age too
there candles
right
he's he's not had his second birthday yet
no not yet
so
few weeks yeah yup
that will be another exciting week
yes
an opportunity to blow stuff
that sounds good
um was there anything that he really loves to play with you didn't see hear
um he does he has a um dolls at home
and he does love to play with dolls he likes to feed them and change their diapers and give them bottles and
um
now what kind of doll does he have
he has um a doll
just a regular baby doll i guess similar to this
yeah
he has a and he has a name for it he calls it d and he likes to undress him and
feed him and he'll change his diaper
and he'll do that with um bears too
he'll s he'll try to change their diapers and things like that
yeah
so
that's something that he usually likes to play with that he didn't seem that interested in
well he was a sweetie he just hung in there for me
and i know it's hard
it's long
i know i
and especially since he has a lot of language
she's tired yeah
okay
yeah sure
you know just kinda the usual questions
so um what did i mean what did you guys kinda start with playing with today
um what did we play with first i guess the animals
did she have any particular favorite one
um i don't think so
we play with animals these ty same little figurines at home
so she likes them a lot
like which ones does she have at home
um we have like the little farm all the farm variety
so
yummy
so like the pig uh horse chicken
were there any animals she saw that she maybe had never seen before
um i guess like the moose
we don't have that one
i don't think she's ever seen that one
um peacock we've seen
i mean all the animals are in books too so i know she's seen a peacock
i think that's it
so she likes to read books a lot
thank you for goldfish
yeah
okay
yeah a lot of the animals' names i think she knows just from books
um so what el what else does she kind of kind of go to today
um i guess the foods
we have those at home too
yeah does she so she has some of these foods at home
yeah we have some of these at home she likes to play you know cooking feed the little animals the food
um what kinds of foods does does she have is it stuff like this
yeah we definitely have you know the standard peas and corn
um this is a new one
kiwi
the the beets are new
the little hotdog
she liked these too
yes the green beans we have at home and we eat the those
so then anything else she played with today
um i don't think so
so i guess the dolls a little bit and we have dolls but she's not a big doll lover
yeah she kinda seemed to like dressing them up a little bit
yeah
a little bit yeah
but has she ever done that before or
yeah we do that a little bit at home um
she's not that into the dolls
she seemed to like putting these on
so funny
yeah
she liked the shoes
ooh look at that cheese
so was there anything that you maybe tried to get her to play with that she just wasn't interested in
um i guess the little screw this little thing
yeah we've tried that before
not her thing
yeah
i would say that's it
we didn't get to all of it
there is a lot
yeah
does she um usually play with similar things in the other sessions
yeah
um yeah in the other sessions yeah we had the fake food more books um not these little fake animals
more books and more fake food
she's not a real doll player but she did like the shoes that's true
and hat but i think it's more because she likes to dress herself
um so was there anything that she usually plays with at home that we didn't have here
um at home we read a lot so she looks through a lot of books
we have this book at home i think it's she's not that interested anymore
um at home we have like little cars and trains she likes
but we have the same set of animals she she never tires of that
yeah they're always
yeah i guess so yep
alright
okay
do you wanna try to get the
i feel like she's
i think she's pretty tired
yeah
yeah
tuned out
yeah even this part shh i could tell she was a little gettin tired
drawing
oh lobster
we're gonna play with our toys
no we're gonna play with these toys we'll leave our we'll play with our toys when we get home
i know its very disturbing for you
we have all these toys neat toys here to play with
what do you want
we're no we're gonna play here for awhile
hey
i've got some crayons
d ya wanna color
um
can you kinda tell me what you guys played with first
um
this
magnetic toy animal thing
did she seem to like it
yes
wha what do you think about it that she liked
um she definitely likes the magnets
yeah
just the the magnetized and the animals
okay
that she can play with
does she have like any favorite animals
um she likes dogs
she likes farm animals
yeah
that we can see at the petting zoo
okay does she have any favorites of those
um
any specific ones or just all of them
pretty much all of them dogs are here favorite i think she likes um the sheep she was the petting zoo she can feed the sheep
right
so what else did she seem interested in
um we played with the plastic animals
um and some of the plastic food but that's it
okay um anything any i guess animals she hasn't seen before
um the lobster she hasn't seen before
okay
and um
a turkey she hasn't seen a real turkey
right
um let's see
and then i guess with the foods
um does she like to play with foods at home is
that
yeah she plays with the kitchen
the real kitchen equipment
yeah
um so does she kinda like i guess does she like play with it when you're cooking
both
yeah
okay um
she's sort of self
yeah
um does she have any like favorite foods
favorite foods
um i would say probably her favorite food is pizza
okay
that's not unusual
yeah
um
but she likes she likes fruit
bread
like toast
yeah
um hotdogs she likes hot
i think we have one of those right
yeah
but she didn't really wasn't really into it
yeah um any foods here that i guess that you played with that she'd never seen before
never seen
um
i don't know that's she's never some of them are not readily identifiable
right
but i don't think there's anything she's never seen
okay were there any other foods here that she kind of
oh this little brown thing i don't
even know what it is
peanut
it's sort of gross
it's sort of gross looking alright
i know
um and any of these other foods i guess like does she eat a lot of these other foods at home
or
yeah i would say
well um lets see was there i guess was there anything you kind of tried to get her to play with she wasn't really interested in
baby dolls
yeah um anything else like
well she was interested in this um toy i don't even know what it is
toy uh chess thing
yeah
but she uh she doesn't know how to play with it and i don't know how to play with it either so
um did you notice anything i guess ya know
different or even the same that that she usually does with play like
um she's quieter here
yeah
than she is at home
um i guess anything she played with today that ya know was new for us or something she never played with
never played with at all
yeah
um we don't have these little animal toys
okay
so i would say those are new
okay
she's a really good cleaner upper
i noticed that she has a bunch of clean up routines
well tha it's daycare they have to they involve them
and both of those right in the
in the trash
um i guess anything else you noticed today
no she's just very uh reserved
yeah
today
she did a good job and she was ya know she was definitely playing with a variety of things
i know she really liked the animals
alright
sure
can't really get her to
you found a pocket
that's okay
it's okay to play with babies
oops me sela
what did she like to do with the babies
just the clothes
and i mean just moving it moving it
and she's fascinated with the eyes
and um
baby was giving her kisses and hugs and
yes
and she's like systematically going through everything
finding the pants
finding the hats
and getting them
she's a great mimic right now
so i think these are tangible things to her
does she um like to put her own clothes on
she doesn't really have the patience for it
but she likes to take off
and fact she'll holler and let me know she's taking off
quite a bit so
but she doesn't really wanna put on
ah well that makes sense
i think was her brother was really interested in the shoes wasn't
yeah
yes
kept changing the shoes changing the shoes yes
and can she get them on and off independently or
ah she found a pair that she could do
haha very good sela
it's very pretty sela
that's good
and what did she decide they were
in terms of babies are they
kids or babies or
baby
just baby
girls or boys
no
and i kinda said he she but i didn't really
does she have any of the clothes that are particular favorites for her
that she really liked
ah the i mean th shh no
not really
she liked all of 
she went to the shoes and socks and the skirts
and the yeah pants
put it on
and didn't wasn't reese also interested in in that
in the backpack
yeah
yes yes
big brother goes to preschool and they
so that's a very interesting thing
yeah yes
a little system yes
and bye bye
goes along with it
yeah i was thinking later that um it would only make sense if you had twins not to have been in the water haha
yeah yes can't do that one
yeah
you guys are out manned
yes we are unfortunately
we'd gone to the beach a couple times but not
only the swimming pool a couple of times it is very difficult
yeah it must be not exactly relaxing
uhoh what's missing
i don't see anything back there sweetie
look there's nothing back there
i wonder if she would like a little more of snack so we can finish up
sure
sela do you want um some snack
yes you do
was there anything you tried to play with that she didn't really
i couldn't get her focus off of this at all to get to the animals puzzles or anything else
yes that can be your seat
d you need help
i don't really have a concept of time either honestly
to know how long i've been doing that or
needing to try to
said
d you want the animals
she just pretended like i didn't even say anything
that's okay
you know there isn't a
go ahead and eat sweetie you're okay
there isn't a requirement
okay
that they play with the other things
um she
does mom
is there anything that she loves to play with at home that she didn't really play with here
um she does love to play with puzzles and animals
um we're getting there with the food
but um that's not really her
she's that yeah
so those two things
along with the dolls
and so does she have a play kitchen yet or
well not not one of those things called a play kitchen
but she has for her birthday she just got a whole tea set and some play food and things like that
and she's getting really into that
yeah
is she interested i wondered in naming body parts
yeah
yeah
she pokes us
quite a bit
oh lovely
doing it yeah
i mean you know it's fine but
yeah
yeah she is
and which ones does she know do you think
no take that out of your mouth
thank you
c you put the bear on the floor
yeah
that's alright i'll get the wipes out
oh sure
um so which body parts does she like to
belly
tummy
ear
eyes
those are the ones that pop into my hand head that she says probably the most
that makes sense
she's walking around yanking everybody's shirt up right now
oh
she's on a kick
that's funny
yeah
that's really funny
well i think um i think we're done here
okay i didn't finish the one last page
you have some friends who are watching they can come right now
ooh
do you think libby wants to come play with us now
i need to um just mop up with you an interview and permission slip
okay okay
which will be about ten minutes but
yes yes
it would be helpful for heddie to um to be able to go
yes
you're so hungry
yeah i'm hungry too
i wonder where tiny baby is i bet he's hungry too
tiny
hey
why don't you come take a walk
d you wanna come see auntie libby
d you wanna trade auntie libby
i heard him crying
oh he's sweet too
he is he's a little sweetheart
my um
my grandmother is convinced that this is the first sweet boy in the entire world previously she thought only girls could be sweet but
oh does she not have much experience with the boys
she has two girls of her own but she has among her seventeen grandchildren
half are boys
oh
well then grandma is a tough audience
yeah she is she she has uh one two three
four five she has six great grandchildren and only one girl
so heddie is very spoiled
she was beautiful for us
we did so much
yeah she was pretty patient
just a trooper i was
so impressed by her
thank you
my kids when we were in california it was always breastfeeding central
yes yes
it was kinda nice in a way
you were never the only one in california
yeah
well what i wanted to do is talk to you a little bit about um
heddie's play
and um what kind of things did she play with first here
we first played with the wooden cut animals
and then
the plastic animals and then i think when she discovered the little toy kitchen she was she liked that
she was really yeah interested in that
does she have any animals that are her favorites
um in general
shh i mean we have dogs and she's a little obsessed with dogs
but she also is very partial to pigs
and um
and giraffes
maybe
but i think the hierarchy is dogs then pigs
then maybe giraffes and beavers
and then everything else
ah
and do you have toys that are similar to these at home
you know um
that that's kind of a tough question to answer right now because we are um uh
we don't have anything that's exactly like anything here
and we're also in the process of renovating a house
so a lot of her normal toys are in storage and she just has a few things
out at the apartment where we're staying for like two months
so i think she's just excited to have so many toys
around um but she has a lot of stuffed animals and she has um
at home she has a little house that has a little kitchen in it
that she likes
has she been to different places where there are a lot of animals
like the zoo
yeah
yeah
yeah she likes the zoo and she likes the aquarium
has she ever been to a farm
yes
yes we just went to a
a like a show farm for a pumpkin festival and
amish country so she's been to farm
and were there any of our animals that you thought were new to her
yeah i don't know if she'd seen a peacock before
i mean maybe she has but
um
i think that one might've been new and
i'm sure there are a few others that certainly aren't in her regular rubbage bar
animals
does she also does she have tools to play with at home
no
no we um because they're renovating the house she sees real tools sometimes
oh
not we're not living there but she comes with me sometimes for walkthroughs and stuff and
and so she knows tools and our my husband is kind of handy and so he has
his own little collection of tools but she's always they always had a distance
but she knows what they are
and she knew painting really well
yeah
i wonder if that's due to the renovation
she maybe or we um she just started an art class a couple of weeks ago and they've been doing a lot of painting there so
she's talked about that more lately
than before
yeah
she also seemed to be um interested in the dolls
yeah she was
and she's not really a big doll person she definitely prefers stuffed animals usually but
she liked this doll
do you have um kind of similar big kid dolls
no we don't and actually my grandma wanted to get her one for her birthday and i said i didn't think she was ready and i may need to reconsider that for christmas because she liked it
so yeah
yeah and their gender is kind of hard to tell
yes it's a little gender neutral
i think that was the point what did you decide it was
i think we thought it was a girl with short hair
yeah i try to take off all the pink before people come in to preserve
right
but then heddie um heddie called it a him a couple of times so maybe she thought it was a boy
well it can be tricky
she also seems to have a lot of nice cooking routines
heddie
yeah
yeah
yes
does she like to help in the kitchen
she does
she does she likes to
she likes to help in the kitchen and she also she really loved her play kitchen before we packed it up she liked to invite people into her little house and to give them things and she'd like carry it around on a tray and get upset if you didn't eat it
were any of these foods here things that she eats in real life
she loves hotdogs when we go to costco that's a special treat for her
um
and the other stuff i don't think it would be particulary familar she likes peas
she's always liked peas
but um i mean we eat a lot of greenbeans but they look very different from the greenbeans you have
um so i don't think that much of the food was part of her you know kind of her regulars or her favorites
and she knows um and she knew um she had that birthday
yes
cupcakes or muffins
yes
yes yes cupcakes definitely she would know
yeah for some of them that is a marvelous new thing
she loves toys like that like the cupcakes that are um um like little things in a series that are connected somehow
when um
when i was we visited my mom's house in denver for a month and
my mom's house is like a wonderland it's like you landed in a fairy godmother's place
and of all the toys and all of the you know these huge open spaces which we just don't have in the city and everything that was there her favorite thing
was a set of um
popsicle molds
it was very much like a muffin tin you know it's it was like six little things like a muffin tin like thing that had stars
oh yeah
like plastic star stick tops that went into it and she didn't know that it was popsicle mold
but she loved it and she wanted to take it to sleep her and she liked arranging the pink stars and the orange stars in specific ways
and then um we were at my brothers place
a couple of weeks ago and he had a popsicle mold set that was different
these the plastic covers of the popsicles came off it looked totally different but it was the same kind of thing it was like a series of things that was not totally dissimilar from the cupcake thing here
and she loved it and she took it all over the house with her
so there's something about that particular type of toy that she finds extremely intriguing
or not even toy the others they're weren't toys they're just objects
but something about having something that fits into something else that's part of a series is really pleasing to her
that is cool
is there anything that she plays a lot that we didn't really see here
um
uh i mean she likes
trying to think what her favorite things are
right now she has a curious george game that she's obsessed with right now that's um
it's like a box that has puzzle pieces on the top of it and under the puzzle pieces is clear plastic and under the clear plastic is
like little blue pellets that's supposed to be sand
and you shake up the box and you find things that are hidden in it
and she put up with our finding things
yeah she
for a long time time because she knows that as an idea
it i mean she just got it last week so it's fresh in her mind and she's literally wanted to play it for like three hours every day since she got it so so she likes that and she likes um
she loves stuffed animals
um
does she play does she take care of them
she does
like what does she do with her stuffed animals
yes
she has a pig that has been her long time favorite and then a little blanket
and she recently informed me that the pig and the blanket were married
which i thought was kind of cute
and um she likes to tuck the pig into the blanket and she talks to them and sometimes oink oink is crying or sometimes he needs a new diaper or sometimes he's happy
and um
do they have meals
uh yes she likes to feed oink oink the blanket not so much he's more an accessory
no mouth
but um but oink oink you know sometimes we have to explain to her that oink oink can't come to the table or he'll get dirty and she says he's hungry
um and she'll feed him different things you know she'll share her milk
her sippy with him
ah
well i think
and she plays a lot with her baby brother is the other things she likes to take care of him a lot
i'm just going to ask a couple questions
sure
um one hundred percent with the toy food
and she was mainly picking out stuff and cooking it for other people and we showed her how to work the stove and
we don't it's not the toy food and stuff is actually toys we don't have at home
some of her friends have them but
does you yeah
in the other play sessions did she tend to go for the food as well
food and books and the animals
i think it's you know those things it's recognizable she has
at one of the play sessions she didn't at that time have a doll um but now she's got dolls at home an you know so
yeah we have a lot of animal toys and games and everything at home too but the toy food we don't
more novel
yeah
we haven't gone to you know kid kitchen and all that stuff so
does she ever
oh sorry go ahead
go ahead i was gonna going to say and she helps me a lot in the kitchen at home so she knows you know the basic process for everything and it's just like hey
that's what i was gonna ask you if um does she help you mix things up or
all the time
she seemed to know what to do
is there anything else like is there anything here that she did different than usual like with the food you said she used to play in the other play sessions
yeah then she was mostly looking at it and naming and we do find because at that point when she was one
so it's just a big difference from the way she can play now versus the way she could play then
so now she's doing more every time you
yeah
did she seem to recognize most of the food here or is there anything she didn't seem to know
um the only ones she didn't know were the things that i didn't quite know what they were until i looked
so like the the tuna we were both a little like um but everything that she has had contact with or eaten or helped me cook she knew what it was
and so she's seen like she's seen you eat some of these things
yeah
oh she knew how to make a sandwich
that was cute
yeah she helps make you know daddy's lunch every morning an
i'm surprised by some of the fruit she was a lot of kids don't know um think it's an apple
the peach
yeah
she's been always been a big fruit and veggie eater
in fact like we were you know worried about her protein level for a while she just loves fruits and veggies so she recognizes pretty much all of them
i'm like okay need some variety so
she seemed to know though i think i thought i saw her looking at the beets or whatever that is
i think it's yeah
or the hamburger or the porkchop or she yeah she knows it's she knows if like she's definitely seen it it's just she doesn't really eat it
do you think she would have recognized any of these animals
yeah for sure
yeah she's she loves animals
i think most kids love animals but
has she seen any in real life
like have you guys been to the
um we've done you know lots of drive like horse places
we've been to the zoo once or twice but um
they're all done with the sheep
thank you
and we've you know like state fairs that kind of thing
she's been in the barns and gotten to touch the cows and touch the llama that kind of thing
so
um so mostly domestic animals
we haven't been to the zoo that many times just because by the time you know she was sort of old enough to get anything out of it it was crowded season and like it's kind of pointless to stand there and have the animal be asleep and
so so we'll probably start taking her we were thinking march april before the tourists really start piling in
yeah i think um she kept calling everything lion in a lot of pictures so i was like oh maybe she's seen this before
it'd be like a tiger picture and then something else um
i know she was like lion so i'm like oh maybe she's been to the zoo and remembered that
yeah she she actually does know the difference like she can do cheetah leopard whatever but she's been on a lion kick lately so
and it's just like a big cat that's obviously not a tiny cat is a lion
i mean well i'm just surprised that she knew that
yeah some some of these are like random animals so
she would probably know most of them
to tell you i mean the lemur maybe not but she'd probably get at least like the category correct
yeah she would probably call that guy like a reindeer because he has horns but
yeah she she knew um reindeer in the picture i was trying to get her to say antler and she was like reindeer i was like oh that's pretty good you know
um with the dolls at home does she tend to like what does she tend to do with them
does she just kinda kind of carry them around or like
um she feeds them
she likes to push them in a little stroller
um she likes to put them to bed
what else do you do with your dollies eve
do you feed them
but it's mostly like feeding pushing in a buggy and she moves them from the buggy to the high chair to the bed an
but she doesn't like them to be undressed which is funny some kids are really into the diaper thing
no
she wants 
just take the clothes off and that's all but
yeah and she does not like that
she likes them to be orderly
well yeah she was like organizing them all and she's like no because i we usually just like toss them in you know the kids are like okay cool
yeah between the way i am or the way she's sort of grown up so far seeing me put things away and then montessori school she's doomed
our place is gonna going to be the most organized place on earth
yeah
that's good um is there anything else you want to tell me about or do you have any questions
nope um i think i wrote on the questionnaire she's really only gotten into toys in the past few months um she's always been more of like a help mommy kind of kid um and when she really started playing with her toys we went through a puzzle stage where all we did were puzzles for like a month and a half
just puzzle after puzzle after puzzle after puzzle after puzzle so now she's starting to get more into blocks and cars and um that kind of stuff
i feel like the puzzles are the best like when i
well she did like the car
she was kind of playing with it but some kids you know are like enough with this i want the real toy
right
and she seemed to like um the book with you too so
we're we read a lot
that's good
that's probably where she gets you know a little vocabulary from
she went she went for a while on um the um vocabulary tests
so that's great
and she does have great um memory and attention for the with the and stuff
i don't know if you're familiar with it but she was she was really um very focused i was like wow so
yeah she's a good little duck
so cute
i had a lot of fun working with her
thank you so much for coming in
no thank you for
and you guys are great testers
i like having experienced um seeing lots of people test some people just move so slowly
well i try
i'm getting you know i'm still kinda kind of trying to get used to going with the pace of a two year old because it all depends on what they wanna want to do
yeah
yeah
so they know it they just know even more about it
yeah
that he shouldn't touch
yes
it's fun to see
no we've done this a couple times so
the doll for you
so he i guess you started out by playing with the cooking things
it seems to be something he really likes
yeah like i tried to go with the dolls
or the animals he wasn't really
into it he kept going back to cooking and then we
asked him if he wanted to read a book
he didn't really seem interested and he went back to the food
and cooking so
but he has all kinds of routines he knows what to do
he's putting ingredients in i think
cause i saw him going like this with these
and then he would mix
so he's watching
is he um do you have kitchen toys at home
um
just a few
b but we have a little kitchen and um just a few little pieces not a lot
just cause it could get really messy
so um
he plays with pots and then the spoons
and he knows what the food are
um they t take out my kitchen stuff like you know the utensils
so sometimes they play with those
i think he likes that too cause usually i don't let him play with it
oh so he was like
he's like i get to play with it now
it's the real one
yeah
that's funny so are any of these toy foods ones that you have as toys
um
we have corn
uh yeah well he knows what cheese is and he knew what it was
and we have this at home for sure
uh
what um what of them would be things that he likes to eat
in real life
um apples cheese muffins cookies pizza
bread
ice i think you have a ice in here
yeah you got ice or
mashed potatoes
it says vanilla ice on it though
it does
oh
looked like mashed potato
so
yeah
and were any that you thought oh this is a new one for him
like these uh premade things here like those foods that like he's probably like oh what is that
and just kinda play with them oh
um
and what does he like to drink
milk
and orange juice
apple juice
water
sometimes
we give it to him we don't ask him because it won't be his choice so he drinks it but uh he won't ask for it
it won't be his first choice
oh what did you find
you know it doesn't open
we have to pretend
here go give some to eileen i think she's gonna make a soup
take you pot eileen
soup
and do you also have you have some dolls at home
oh yeah his sister we have dolls
doll clothes we have the little animals
um have a magnet board at home
a stove top kitchen
we have some tools
um not exactly those screw on kind
i wish they really did screw they don't
yeah
it's just pretend it's not as exciting
yeah so and then we have dress up clothes
so he he likes to play dress up too
look at that cheese
give some to eileen
put it in the pot
and did you get out some of the animals
yeah
doctor r um ratner's excited about her exotic animals
yeah
yeah
like i'm not sure if he knows what like something like this is
probably think it's like a deer or a horse
what is that baby
hello moose
i guess we see the more like your more regular animals
so he knows those but these are probably like oh okay
he'll probably think this is a s cat or a squirrel
and you found good night moon
yeah we have that at home
but he didn't he didn't really want to read it
so he just seemed more interested in food in the kitchen
so
well that makes sense
we have a lot sometimes they're tired by the time they get to this part
yeah and if you offer everything
i think that would be the last choice it's not as interactive um and hand on as these other toys you know a book
is there anything that he really likes to play at home that we
didn't have here at all
um
he likes trucks i didn't see you have trucks or cars here
he likes trucks cars balls
um yeah
this and then this other stuff he normally plays with so
yeah we um trucks and cars you tend to get a lot of and not a lot of words
yeah
he likes um like airplanes and
just your typical boy stuff
uh shovels like pretending to dig
um he likes he has a harmonica he likes playing that
a little pretend harmonica
he likes instruments so
does he like music
yeah i think so he has a flute
a little toy flute he started playing that
um so yeah
these go together
maybe you can fix it
you know what we forgot to do completely is we have these two forms
so maybe i will give these to you now
yeah yes
it's just with two year olds it happens sometimes
that they you know they talk best with their families
yeah he's shh um initially really shy he'll do more actions with people than talk
that will be his last warming up
and do you feel that we got a pretty good idea of the kinds of things that he would say today
sometimes he would say no and i thought you do to
yeah he he initially says that first
and then later
but it doesn't mean that he doesn't know that
yeah i don't really think he spoke his full vocabulary like he would at home
like he speak three and four letter sentences and he
you know he's always saying mommy and help and please and excuse me a lot of different words
well that's why we have the parent survey so we can know
yeah it's hard to kinda get it all out in w in a session
cause he's still warming up to the place too
even when you started playing he started naming things immediately
yeah i think the weird names of the people kind of
yeah for him
i think it was a little it seemed like it was a little bit
i was really pleased and impressed that he stuck with it
yeah
the weird names like the ones he didn't want to say he just wanted it
kind of like either confused or
but i don't know
he went up with me through the two syllables
yeah
and then when they were three and strange
he was like
you know like telephone words he knew
and a lot of kids i think they already have like like a two syllable a shorter version they tend to use
yeah
so for those he didn't mind
but when they got weird that's okay you know
different kids you know are
oh good
try that purple box test that was great
look at this he's got pictures
are we done
yeah this'll be fun
so this is you know like last time i'll just ask you about the toys you played with
she loved the muffins
like holy cow
she she was really interested huh
she was really into she wanted to stir them she wanted to put in she wanted to count she fed to the babies
i think she liked the muffins the best out of everything
we often get uh cupcake
oh
but she's just shy of her birthday
yeah
so
yeah
we do have we do cupcakes at home
but we do more muffins
so my son really likes muffins
so strange she said we do pumpkin muffins even when it's bread we call muffins then
yeah no
so we call muffins
well what did she seem to play with first
um we played with the dolls first
and then food
and then we hit animals for a little bit
and then it was back to the food
and then i tried to get her over here
i felt like we kinda neglected this section
but she didn't seem super interested
ah
we have that book at home so i thought maybe she would recognize it or look at it or something but
she liked the muffins
you know the book doesn't i always think that too but and that they'd be tired by the time they get to it but
yep
not so much
usually for most people does she have um dolls at home
we have babydolls but nothing that you dress yet
not we don't have we to not have a lot of mess this is like a lot of pieces for us
for me for right now
um we do have a lot of food
um
most of the food we just don't
i don't think she really plays with it too much
we don't have a lot of animals
well she was really interested in the different clothes huh
she liked the shoes
ah
she really likes shoes
so she wanted them to have shoes
i tried to find like matching shoes but that was there's a lot of black and white shoes
so
yeah we try for um you know we try for gender neutral
yeah
well although this is a tutu i think
it's fine
oh is i couldn't like quite figure it out oh a pompom
ah
i couldn't figure it out it was just like pink and kinda swirly
yeah
and she didn't play with the tools too much
oh she seemed kinda interested
yeah
she well we fixed tried to fix this but
yeah that is a problem with the fixers fall apart
yeah
and um she also sleeps with her babydolls at home does she have play routines
she hugs them
um we hug we do a lot of hugging and kissing
yes
and i try to get her to tuck them in
because she doesn't like a blanket on her at night i'm always afraid that she's cold
so i think if we tuck the babies in then she'll see that a blanket is okay
yeah
but there's
she stands up and cries until i leave the room and then she lays down and falls right asleep
but she won't let me put a cover on him
oh okay
but we put covers on babies
okay
so we've started and we tuck the babies in we lay the babies down we put the blanket on the babies you say night to the babies and then i say you lay down and it's like no
can't get me to lay down i won't be covered up
yeah
so
she's onto you
she is she's smart
and she also played some with the animals
she played a little bit
yeah
we named 
um does she have one that she liked i don't think so
want to know were there any that she particularly liked
but it
we played with this a little bit
she liked this thing
li stove
did she are there any animals that she would've seen in real life
um well
from this set probably not
yeah
i we've seen cow is there a cow in here we've seen pigs
we've seen
rabbits we've seen squirrels
you know we're city folk now
we're city folk
it's a little harder
are there any that you think you named for the first time today
the swan
i know we've done peacocks we've done bees
um
this ring tailed thing
i know we've done penguins
um
oh
the swan
i don't think i've named a swan for her before
or a moose
and does he have animal toys at home
no no
we're all therapy toys
oh
i hate to say but we are we're like what can
i know
well right now
right right
we're beads and blocks and um
drawing and coloring and
what else do we play with a lot we're in therapy a lot so
lots of books lots of um
do you have um
do they come to your home for this or do you is is it center based
no
oh no
yeah center based
center and school so he goes to therapy
five days a week in the morning
and then we come home and he goes to school all afternoon
wow
so
and when he's at school she's taking her nap
so when she wakes up from her nap then we get to play
um at therapy we do books we have car toys that are like all one piece battery operated
like easy to clean up toys
yeah
so
it's a little different
yeah it sounds like she did seem to like the cooking toys
yeah
we have a big kitchen
um we got it for therapy
my son can pull up in it it's the step two walk in kitchen
so we got it so he can pull up
it was you know a wider base
and we didn't want him pulling up on something and then tipping it over
so we have the biggest walk in kitchen that they make
ah
so the kitchen is a fun toy and we have an art desk so she likes to color
um
we have a lot of free space
for running and playing and and stuff
oh that's nice
um are there any of these foods that she likes to eat in real life
she likes orange juice
she doesn't like ice she doesn't like pizza she likes cheese
she likes cookies of course
she doesn't like meat a lot yet
she likes cheese she doesn't like peas even though she likes to pick them up
and she says she wants them
we don't eat a lot of soup
we eat anything that's super hands on
and do your toy foods are these do you have any of these foods at home
we have this exact same piece of pizza
ah
we have these peas
we don't have any sushi toy at home
the sushi on her quilt
i think we have this though our cookie has brown chips in it
we have some cans of soup um
we have some hamburgers
i mean we have similar foods
we don't have any i don't think we have any kiwi at home
we don't have i don't think we have any ice
i don't think we have any muffins
yeah those are cute aren't they
yeah they are they're so cute
yeah it's nice that they fit yeah
that's always nice
and then there's a puzzle too
yeah
and is there anything that you thought you'd be she'd be interested in and she just really didn't go for
no
i mean just the book
she normally she's a big person
maybe everything else was exciting and new and different
so but normally she brings the book over
yeah
well she um you know she made it through everything we made her do it's a long morning
yeah
except for the train
yeah
sorry
well no that's okay it's you know the thing is that with two year olds it's tricky they are often not guessers
yeah
she was a little bit
yeah
but um
you know you have to kind of fiddle with it and you don't know really is am i done because it's hard for me now
yeah
am i done because i'm done with you
yeah
you don't know
which you're dealing with and we just we just do our best
yeah you did fine
but um
no and she was um i noticed too i wondered what your um i felt like sometimes for my little penguin she gave me placeholders
i don't know if she was always trying the name
what did you think
oh
sometimes she was saying she i think she was saying bird a couple times
yeah or there's that one called dook and everytime it comes in here it's like yes duck
can't you see
it's a duck
yeah
duck right
but yeah
yeah
so yeah some of the ones that were like the stranger the ones that you made up names for some of she got some of she didn't some of them she said like like the
yeah
okay
as long as she tried did you see some of them she tried did not try
oh some of she didn't try
okay
yeah
yeah some of she didn't try but the pullaphone pullahphone
punephone
punephone and then she got the phone
yeah yeah it's a phone what are you talkin about
i don't know what you're tryin to get me to say here phone okay it's callin so
linguistically it's kind of interesting
like what she uh she does
i'm actually afraid that you're actually testing me
well actually now that we're there um let me get to that
okay
for all this time she's been coming in and you've been coming in and um we've been recording her and we've also been recording you
oh yay
um and we don't talk about it at the beginning because it's already weird enough in the little room with the ladies and um
and we're afraid that you know people would alter what they did even more
oh yeah
if we talked earlier
but we're looking at one of the things we're also looking at is how people talk to their children and how their their speech and language change to their children as children get older
okay
as children understand more when you first came when she was seven months old the chances of her understanding most of these were very minimal
right
right
and then um as they get older their chances of understanding increase but also on pace with um what they might produce
yeah
right right right
if they're in a repeating mode or not
and so we're looking at um particularly some acoustic things
that's one one of the things we've looked at so far where um we look at how distinctly someone says something like cat
i just said it without a lot t
and
right
but you get it and it's pretty normal
right
um so we're looking at how people do that for people who might be learning a lot of new words cat and can cat and
right
or you know
and we'd love to do that for that we need your permission
oh that's fine
yeah
on the back here
so that one is this one
so let me just
you can do whatever you want to with anything
and this is um it's got two and it's initial and initial sign
yeah
and then um
this is kind of how it works with with the um research approval after the final consent form we thought of something else
oh okay
so we had to make another one
that's fine
and i said they're working on a um we've had for a long time an online database of child language
and um it's transcripts on the computer
okay
and it's really interesting but it's only as interesting as the transcripts
right
and our better computers but we can now keep digital audio
oh cool
and so it isn't there yet but the university of maryland with some other universities are hoping to put together an online audio missing database of child language
but
oh okay
in something like that we can search for things that we don't even know are important yet
okay
like these acoustic pieces
okay
that are lost when someone transcribes it
right
all of it is is completely deidentified anytime we mentioned you know that you have a bunny where you live your name her name
that gets bleeped out
yeah
and it also gets kept separately from the demographic information
it's okay if you tell people that we have a bunny
well you know
i don't think that anyone's gonna care i know what you mean
but also if you know ten years from now you think gosh it'd be so cute to hear her we couldn't find it it's not kept with your information anymore
right
it goes into the pile
into the void
yeah
it goes into the void it's okay
i mean it's conceivably i don't see how you could find it
yeah
there's no way basically
yeah
you'd have to listen to them all
yeah
and then pick out your kid
that'd be an interesting study
it'd be thousands ten years later
can you but if you listens yeah well like could like pick out like
and can you remember
what you talked about
yeah so for that there are three flavors this one is just to be in this research
this one is yes we can use transcripts but not those audio files and this one is the most permissive to let us contribute our audio missing files to other people's research so you choose one here and you sign
yeah
yeah
and do you have um have more any questions for me about the things we did today
no
no
okay
well that's easy
we we just come in for i think it's fun
yeah
just call and and ask
i don't think so we just do it for the i mean we used to live five minutes away so it was a lot easier
but um we do it it's somethin to do
well i think
it's somethin to do
well it's interesting you get a different perspective on your child and um
yeah
yeah
i think so
i have a very different perspective on my son now
you know and the day to day too sometimes you know the younger sib sibling
well that's what i even told
devon
devon there we go
i was like it's nice to just watch
it's nice to just watch like what she does like sometimes i don't get to just watch her
like you know
yeah
you have a package deal going
yeah exactly you can't
yeah exactly you're like you go over there
and i'm gonna watch you and uh
she's obviously very different with him than she is on her own
with him like she's always like fightin to keep her stuff you know
get away from me i'm playing over here and then he wants her whatever whatever she has is the best thing according to him so if she had this doll even though he had never played with this doll ever
he would come up and snatch it away from her
so it's nice to let her have everything
so
ah
it's fun
it's a fun thing
we did add questions about siblings to our questionnaire
yeah
um i think that they weren't there for the couple and then we thought oh
this needs this is important
yeah
yeah yeah you know it's it's different
and i'm sure if you did this in our house you would get much different stuff we did a few things with georgetown too
oh yes
georgetown comes and does stuff in your home and obviously now we moved away but it's kinda cool
i think this is fun
oh that's interesting
it's interesting being on the other end of it too with
everything
so so we're all done except for the prize which is still kind of small
prize
yeah but she can pick one or you can pick one for the ride home
it seems very small compared to your effort and um driving time
oh
doesn't matter
i have some books i have some cute t
with the with the little turtle on 
we want books we love books
alright
so
she ah did really well today
do you wanna want to tell me a little bit um what she started playing with
the kitchen
okay
an the food
is that stuff she plays with a lot
yeah at home
yeah she mostly
she has a little play kitchen
that's what she likes to play with the most
okay
um was the stuff we had here similar to what she has
um the food and stuff is different but you know similar i g
you know it's just different types
um were there any types of food that she never seen before
um whatever those are
i guess they're supposed to be
beets maybe
yeah
and uh sushi she's probably never really seen a lot
that's probably about it
okay
these other foods does she have um
not necessarily like play food versions of them but she eats them so
okay like what
like uh the green beans and uh cheese corn stuff like that
at home her set is like a little diner so it's mostly like hamburgers hotdogs
not a lot of fruits and vegetables in it
um does she like to um play with any like real food cooking stuff
yes she does
she helps cook with my husband a lot
they make
almost every weekend they cook something together
what kind of things does she like to make
um they'll make um whatever tacos hamburgers eggs for breakfast
um she'll help make waffles or cupcakes different things like that
okay um so what else was she interested in today
um not really much
i got her to come over to the dolls for like a minute but she mostly wanted to focus on the food
um so she played with the dolls a little bit
um what kind of things was she doing with them
um i was asking her to help me pick out some clothes for the dolls but she lost interest after pants and shoes
yeah
um does she have dolls at home
she does but she doesn't play with them a lot
okay so not really did she every really play with them
not really yet
maybe as she gets older
um so what else did you try to get her to play with that she wasn't really interested in
i tried showin her the different animals and uh she wasn't really interested
does she play with animals at all
she has some little animals like this at home but she doesn't really play with 
okay
um i heard you name a couple
were there any ones that she might never have seen before
oh yeah probably lots
like beaver um otter um llamas eel
probably most of the water ones she'd just be like fish
um and any ones that she was familar with
um yeah she knows um most she knows most of like farm animals and things like that
so like that one over there had um like a turkey in it
she knows turkey
she knows chicken things like that
cow
um yeah you said the turkey she recently went
she did
she went to a petting zoo last weekend with her grandparents so she got to feed some birds and things like that
um so ah did she play with anything else really
mostly just the food
yeah that's a pretty popular area for kids
they like to put things together an
yeah
um so did you um notice anything about her play today that was different from either what she does at home or what she did at previous play sessions
i mean from previous play sessions it was just probably
i remember her really liking the food in previous play sessions too
an you know it's probably just the next version of whatever she did then
um and are there any um toys at home that she does play with that we don't have here
um at home she likes to play with um like uh duplos
she'll snap those together and make towers
and um she likes to play with her she has lots of books she likes to read to herself or her dolls or her baby brother
um what else does she do at home
uh color playdoh things like that
puzzles she likes um like the peg puzzles with like the different shapes and everything
she does lots of puzzles
um is there anything else you noticed today that you wanted to mention or
i don't think so
mkay
cookin it
oh do you leave this on
we'll just leave that on
okay
but uh we try to uh if she needs to go out for a like walk or something that's also a possibility
i think she'll just play
yeah
alright so um you wanna kinda just tell me what you started playing with today
um i guess we started with the the puzzle
um but then we got into obviously the kitchen a lot and the dolls
and i brought in the animals
okay so um the kitchen that's the thing she played with a lot
it's funny beca i she has a one at her daycare we bought her one for her birthday but we're moving so we haven't put it we decided not to put it
we're horrible
we figure we give it at christmas next year
because like we don't want the movers to break it
so um but yeah we don't have any food toys or any like anything like that we were gonna give that all i had bought it all but i hadn't we haven't given it to her
and they don't it's not a big part in her um daycare either
they have a little kitchen but they don't have like anything foodwise like this so
she did really play with that
she really she was very in the do
the dolls are definitely something she absolutely loves at home and has tons of strollers and and stuff like that
so that
but yeah
what other stuff what other kinds of things does she do with dolls at home
she she will walk her baby dolls everywhere um with the stroller um
she has a highchair for her dolls so she'll put it next to her highchair
um she tucks them in
she loves to tuck everything has to be tucked in at night too
everybody has to have a blanket
um yeah those are mainly
um and so with the food you said she doesn't have a but um have you seen her do the stuff she was doing today before
no because we don't have any of the um the stuff the toys
right
really
you know in terms of her own eating though you know the grabbing the spoon and everything and the bowl and things like that
so does she have any of these foods in real life
um she will not eat vegetables that's why i was joking about that
um cupcakes
she does have cupcakes um
yo you know some of them she she won't eat mashed potatoes but she's playing with those so
uh she ha i mean she's seen them but she doesn't eat a lot of them
the cookies
cupcakes and cookies she's big fans of
she's the worlds worst eater
um is there any food that um she had maybe never seen before
um yeah she wouldn't have seen the ribs really um the tuna i don't think um
she's seen donuts but she's i don't know if she's really had donuts she's had more of the munchkins you know not a real a true donut
um but yeah those
the pie maybe she really hasn't seen the pie
everything else she's seen you know
or the sushi
that was a new one
yeah
that's definitely new
um so you said a lot a lot of the foods she'd seen um but she wouldn't really eat
yeah like the like she eats the like she'll eat pizza and cheese and bread those she'll eat but not
and the cupcakes
but not the vegetables um not the potatoes not the hotdog
i know
yeah
but i think she was throwing things in the pot you said
she kept throwing the animals in the pot
or she was cooking them
yeah
so
so any of those animals does she play with those a lot or
um no
we don't have anything like that like little figurines
um we have a lot of books with animals in the pictures so we look at like a lot of picture books with animals so
um so were these animals that she's familiar with
probably not no none of these really
maybe the seal but no none of the others would she really seen that much
was she interested in any particular one
she kept playing with these two guys so
she still is
she seems to like them
and the um fly
the or the otherwise known as the ladybug
buzz or the bee i guess more so
um let's see did she do anything else with the dolls today
the dolls she op she fed the dolls she gave them juice she fed them each meals and shh um she opened their eyes
um did you notice anything i noticed anything um similar to what she usually does at home
anything with the dolls is what she does at home she definitely um
you know it we don't like she take to toys like i have um little princess figurines but they're princess dolls and she likes to put them in her her box and carry things around
so like it didn't surprise me that she was putting everything into the bowl like she likes to do that even though they're not suppo not all those things are supposed to go in she will put all her favorite things in an area of something a bowl a box and then push it around usually
yeah
that's what she does
um and anything that you saw today that was um different i know some of the but anything you hadn't seen her do before
i mean i never heard her really say like i wanna cook it or things like that so perhaps we should uh unwrap that kitchen
um and let's she what was there anything at home that she usually plays with that we didn't have here
um at home she you know like i said it's like the we have the whole crib the stroller so the whole doll ensemble
um and uh she has um like these like thick kinda like lego blocks that she likes she plays with those
um anything that has wheels that she can push too she loves like trucks or anything like that
um and she has a dollhouse at home that she that always she always is playing with her dollhouse
anything else you you saw today that
no
she just loved playing with the food
yeah she does
alright well great she was uh really good today
yeah
i would say
yeah well that's a long
it was
it's a long session for this
she kept getting things right and we had to keep going
that's right
i you're just always like you get or you were so close and then they get one and then
but yeah i thought you know she definitely was exhausted during the book
yeah
like she just wasn't even doing that one
she powered through at the end
yeah
that was good
yeah
everything else i thought she did great on
about his play you know compared to what you've done before with him here and
okay
so what um oh and did
haha lovely
does it look it looks set huh
looks like you did it
no no you didn't
i don't have the signature on
no you do right here this looks
this looks done right
yeah was there another place to sign
i
the initials
are you are they supposed to
oh maybe is this initial something here
yeah right there
oh okay there i guess
okay
okay
oh with audiovisual
oh the audiovisual
so it seemed like um he was really interested in playing with the kitchen huh
yeah um he goes back and forth and sometimes
he's obsessed with the those big chunk legos
oh the blocks um
um sometimes he's obsessed with
his dump truck and dumping it
um and um
we have a little kitchen area downstairs in the basement and a play area
and it's also his sisters so
so he'll copy his sisters he's very interested in
ah
are there um are there any of our toy foods that are toy foods that he has at home
um we have like we have what do we have a hamburger patty and
carrots and apples and
bread and yeah but they're
they're similar and we have sushi
and
the foods are very similar and he has they have a little stove down downstairs too
um and he comes in the kitchen with me a lot
yeah
um so he just discovered the spice cabinet yesterday
ah
which was interesting that he did the whole thing and we went to the spice shelf and we opened up about eight of them and let him smell and he was just totally fascinated by it
oh
and um the dolls
he plays with his sisters and yelling at about
you know playing with her dolls and his dolls
ah
um
is he interested in the dolls clothes or
um he's interested in take off
yeah
then i don't know how much he's interested in them
um
and how his own clothes
his own clothes he's uh
he's funny he's more interested in putting h doing it himself by putting it on
the diaper
you know he wants to get the diaper he wants to open the tabs he wants to you know he wants to put it on but he can't match the but
anything that he can do
he wants to putting his shirt on putting his pants on
put those shoes on by himself with his socks
ah
um taking them off
it's fu it's kind of funny i think you know my experience has been most babies like to things off first
yeah
he likes to run around naked but he won't you know take the clothes off
ah
yeah
but once he is naked and he gets a chance to run around then he's happy
um which of these foods are things that he likes to eat in real life
um well i guess
um
i don't know if um
you know the kiwi he knows all these little round fruits that he calls balls he recognizes a lot of fruits
and he would eat just fruit if he if he had had the chance um
he knows banana he knows corn he knows um
uh he knows peas but he doesn't like peas
ah
he knows little sushi
i don't know if he knows the little donutty muffin thing
um
and uh
i don't know what he thinks that is i don't even know what this i just kind of whether that's
i don't know what that is
well
if it's cheese a cheese slice or bread or
i think of it as the bun myself
the bun
oh okay i see i see
but it could be a cookie
she likes that stuff
yeah
and you guys also looked at some of our animals a little bit
yeah um
he's usually interested in animals you know we don't thinking about it we don't have a lot of animals that size in detail
you know it's more in the sort of stuffed animal category like he has a monkey and he has a lemur
yeah
but it's more it's the sort of plushy thing
what kind of animals has he had a chance to see in real life
um dogs cats squirrels birds gerbils we have a gerbil um
has he been to a farm or a
yeah
cows and fish and goats
sheep and chickens
um
but he was only he was two when he went to the farm once and the zoo once
it isn't really a repeated activity
no
and now it's yucky out
and now it's yucky out yeah
although
we went to the national zoo on thanksgiving day and it was really brilliant no one else was there and i thought the museums
oh yeah
can't too crowded
and we just kind of huddled and ran to the next indoor bet
yeah
yeah
but also at the zoo i found but if it's a cold or not so desirable weather day to go to the zoo that animals get really hungry for people
for to walk by
i remember um some of the bird watch bird exhibits
and we'd walk we'd go to the thing and all of a sudden they'd come bounding down like oh i gotta see some visitors
it was so strange
oh that's so funny it's not what i would expect
they're used to having the social hour
yeah
um so
yeah it was very fun to see too during the fine motor that he's really interested manipulating things
yeah
yeah
he um
you know he would like to take things apart
um
they were
and you say he has experience with tools
or watching you with
he does yeah
yeah and we have it's funny we have a i have a screwdriver set that i have the handle and i add different tops to the so it was interesting that you have that
oh
around
um
and he seems to know the routine too with something that's broken and that he's gonna
yeah
and then he's gonna fix it
broken things
um and he likes he's fanatic about shoes
yeah
and boots especially
ah
he's crazy for boots
from d s w
and he just starts saying boots boots
boots
you like boots
um
um is there anything that he plays a lot at home and we don't have here at all
um
he has um
he has some um trucks
um that he plays with
a lot he has these
what do you have in here that just
he has these puzzles you know that have airplane firetruck you know you take them out of their spots
and then you put them back and they're
in their spots
in their spots
yeah but they're chunky ones so you can
the chunky ones and he has the ones that you have a little fishing pole with a magnet on the end
ah
yeah we've been playing a lot of that
and of course his little bike scooter thing and he has a rocking horse
oh
oh he plays with a lot
he plays with um the stacking cups a lot
that little ring thing
you know where you put the little
that was yeah he saw he knew what my stacking cups were for
instantly
yeah yeah
i wondered too if he um he seemed pretty familiar with my little square blocks
and i wondered almost if he had done the test before
he had an evaluation for the montgomery county and he did not i don't think he put more than two or three one inch blocks
stacking
and i've been doing it back and forth with him and uh i only saw him do once he did a stack of seven blocks
wow
and um and then i didn't see it again
and he
so if he has the choice between the two blocks a one inch and a lego
yeah
like he'll go to the lego
well
i would too
yeah
they're color they intricate stuff
and they stay together
that's the first time i saw him do a little train
ah that was really interesting
that's what that's funny that's when i thought has he had the mullen
yeah i mean i and when and the filling out the questionnaire um
i stack them for like that just to see if you know if he would
oh yeah yeah
like i don't really know where he is with this
it's in there isn't it
and he just kinda looked at them like yeah right
yeah he pulled it out very nonchalantly for me
yeah yeah
that was fun
we just learned that
you know it's been there the whole time and he just was you know not in the mood to spin able to score you know or make a train for me
on of the house
he does like to be the one driving
he does
he does yeah
choosing the activity and um
yeah
how it's gonna go
and he communicates that very beautifully exactly what
and i might you know and i certainly have encouraged it i guess
maybe indirectly i don't know and then just the beginning of his playing i wouldn't i would wait for his cue and i wouldn't say back before he and i wouldn't say this is a red something or other or this is a i would just
yeah
let him make whatever he wanted
um was our initial play
until he started naming things on you know that was then and i started naming things back to but
now you said that infants and has been to evaluate him
yes
but you
in december and they are accepting into his into their program
they said he has a mild they think he has a mild delay
of making sounds
um and um that um
they're gonna work with him two times uh a month
for six months
and
i mean i'm gonna work with him but
yeah
yeah that's the
and then but um
so um he had had incredibly bad reflux when he was a newborn and
for six months and um
uh we didn't know first it seemed like it was a cold
um but he never spit and i thought cool a baby that doesn't spit up right
i mean how lucky can i get
and then he just got more and more congested and um and then it he'd stop breathing five or six times
how scary
and i would get the little aspirator thing and of mucus would thick mucus and as soon as i pulled it out it was like
you know um
and so finally uh uh i brought him to the pediatrician
um once and then i brought him back again they said it was cold brought it back again and i said i am in such sleep deprivation from you know keeping away and it could happen during the night too and what's the sound of not breathing it's you know
how frightening
unless you can hear his body banging and you throw his head back
and bang he was on something that made noise you knew and if it was just on you know like a mattress
oh gosh
so he slept in the crook of my arm for many weeks
um just so i could feel it
yeah
you know the tenseness
and he they rushed him to the hospital
office visit and he just this is not good he's working too hard to breathe and
and then he stopped breathing in the ambulance and then i was surprised that the ambulance did not have or initiate any kind of
extraction mechanism i mean
they had an oxygen tank there but if he can't get it in
you know reach into the diaper bag and go like why did i call the ambulance i could've just done this
um and i couldn't get it out though
and then we took to the hospital and they had some super duper suction thing
and picking it up and then i took him to children's
they examined and well i said he had the reflux that that he's spitting up
out your mouth goes up into your sinuses and your nasal cavity and it just irritates it and inflames it so that
oh my goodness
you know a little bit of mucus hardens and it it blocks blocks up then your airways and something i didn't know
infants at least under six months do not breathe through their mouths
well no they can i mean it's open but it's some sort of thing with suckling and you know being able to swallow and it not interfere with breathing
can
yeah
yes
so if their nose is stuffed up
they don't breathe
so
anyway so when infants and came they asked me about that and they said there is some type of correlation between this type of reflux and delayed speech
um and they didn't know what the reason was um
and you know it was slightly muscular
i don't know some other correlation so
yeah
think we'd work with him for awhile
well that that's lovely
he seems to be hungry for labels
i felt like a weenie when i kept asking him what things were and he would repeat what i just said
yeah
yeah
you know i thought you know here's a child who's working on this and my book thing that's standardized
yeah yeah
doesn't provide for that
but um so that's great you know he wants to know those labels
yeah
um when he started to his kind of generalized labels
that's like kind of early earlier language development thing where i'm gonna i wanna talk about all these things i can use ball
yeah
and i have he has a whole series of cars
right right
and a whole series of dogs it seemed like too
where he needs a label he's reaching for one
yeah
and hasn't yet got the precise ones that are gonna fit for him
right
but um
but looks like he's looking for them so that's lovely
yeah he is and i you know and she said to me maybe if we did nothing at all you know it would he would just sort of you know go into the next phase just maybe a little later
uh but um talked about frustration
you know the problems of if he gets frustrated and then that might delay the speech further because then he won't want to talk and if he gets frustrated and then he can't say the word you know
and so we're just trying to bypass you know frustration by working on it
so that he can have possibly you know have speech a little earlier than
so how old was he when he had that hospital trip
i think a month and a half maybe
so he was little little
when i mean jeez
yeah he was a tiny little thing
um
and he you know it's funny he looked very healthy though
i mean he was very robustly built
so you might say that you know so like i'd talk to the other moms yeah well how's doing fine etcetera you know
five times yesterday stopped breathing and
they'd just look at me like
but he looks so healthy
yeah he's eating
maybe they think i'm just overreacting
but um
well how are you supposed to yeah that sounds like it was rough time
it
gosh
yeah it was very frightening because um
you know i had never heard of this reflux before
so i wasn't working on any other cues except he's got a really bad cold and then when it int went it into stop breathing
whatever it is even if it's a really bad cold
and he's not breathing from it and that's still you know
but you don't know my sister's son h has um had croup
and half the time they're like why are you here in the emergency room and the other half of the time they're like well you left this late
yeah
and she can't predict
yeah
which nurse which reaction which
right right right
so that's okay you know what
yeah
yeah i you know there's always time to say oh i'm sorry that you know we you know overreact i don't you know
never mind
absolutely
it's like alright well that's why i'm coming here so you can tell you can correct me if i need correction i don't mind but
do you have any questions about any of the things we did
during the course of the morning
um
well you know just i guess you know in a question about setting up the experiment and trying to figure out what kind of information you're getting
um you know when he when you turn the page and there was a bicycle there
i mean he just loves bikes right
yeah
so i think how do you know when a child is answering your question or
you know is gravitating to the thing that's interesting to him
yeah well it's hard
well it was hard with the vocabulary test this way
because really the first time i got things out he was pointing
to the thing he liked
the car not the airplane
right
so i think that on that one in particular there was also how does a two year old tell you he doesn't know
that's yeah
yeah
none of them they don't they're bad guessers
right
many won't guess
yeah
they don't say i don't know
so it's always kind of a read
that we're you know we're hoping for
and we know that you know if he had something different for breakfast or you know if it were a different day of the week
right
it could be
it is bedtime that all of things really change how an individual child does and we hope by doing many many
that we're able to see some things
yeah
and that's an average in itself
yeah
yeah
i have um for the very end i have two more permission slips for you
okay
i wonder about that myself too
my default it usually just comes out how i would talk to any other person
unless he's actively trying to say something
um and i'll just ask you a few questions
of course
just kinda like we've done the past you know three or four times you've been here
um so if you just wanna kinda start just kinda tell me what she starting playing with
um well the animals because we collect i mean she wasn't speaking for a little while and so what someone told me was they do the animal sounds so we started collecting and doing the animal sounds
so she has a lot of these characters
um so i think those are familiar to her
and she has started recently to reach the point where she will do like imaginative play she has a kitchen and her baby dolls and she'll pretend like she is cooking dinner and go take care of the babies and stuff like that
so she likes a lot of this stuff now
okay
um i did notice i could hear a little bit making the animal sounds so is that something you've kinda been working on with her
yeah at a year she wasn't saying a lot of words so what um we had gotten referred to get evaluated i can't remember the name of it infant and childrens's i guess they came and evaluated and so they think everything is okay but a way to get her really talking is i guess kids start with the animal sounds
so every time we went to target we would get another one of the animals and so we have a huge collection of these
so does she know most of the sounds those animals make
most of them like all the ones we have at home she
yes baby
you're cooking
very good
um all of the ones we have at home she knows the sound and name of it
um so those i think were familiar and like i said this now is like we bought her a little kitchen and little table and chair set so now she'll play with those
were there any animals that she had never seen before
yeah i mean a handful like the turkey and the peacock um there are a whole bunch in here that we don't have they're not the same collection
but like the ducks you know the ducks the birds the cats she knew um but i think some of the more like exotic animals we didn't have
okay
so you said she played with the food a little bit um did she have a favorite food item you think
um she kept giving me the juice to drink and pretend with her i mean she recognized the ice right away which is a lot about what we feed her
um the ice and her apple as she calls it
i think those are the ones that she recognizes the most
were there any that um maybe she would have never seen before
um i can't even remember what these are called now not cranberries the i guess cranberries right that's the canned cranberries
so some of these we you know the cheese she's done no pies um
what else do you have
maybe the cupcakes i dunno if she recognizes cupcakes yet
but like the drinks whoops
um so does she have similar foods at home
to play with
um you know honestly i don't have any of the foods yet i just have pots and pans i still need to pick up some of the foods for her
okay does she like to cook
she pretends to cook and sometimes she will take what's in her bowl and put it in her pots and pans
you know like if i've made some popcorn she'll put the popcorn in their and play with it like she's cooking stirring it up
and then i guess any of these foods that um she would actually eat in real like i mean i know you said
oh yeah definitely the cheeses she eats um like let's see the cheeses the apples not the pies like she'll do the pizza
um maybe ice once in a while
i don't know what else we have here
some of the veggies if i am creative on how to give them to her
juice for sure
um so what did anything today that you tried to get her to play with that she wasn't really interested in
i thought she was gonna go for the dolls she didn't go for the babies
she told me i mean she whispered them to me about the babies but she didn't wanna pick them up after i told her to go get them
so you said she plays with babies at home
okay what kinda stuff does she do with them usually
she'll feed them she'll dress them you know she'll push them in her stroller she'll tell me that she's putting them night night
she will discipline them tell them you know no no and they've been naughty
um so i mean everything she sees done she'll do i mean i've seen her rocking the babies to sleep
um anything you noticed today about her play that was different from what you normally see
i mean today i mean today she's just being very shy
i mean she's usually loud and wild and this is not
and i don't know like i said she didn't get a nap and the sitters she fell asleep in the car she got a twenty minute nap and i woke her up
so i don't know if that's part of it and then part of it too i think everything's just unfamiliar
right
um so are there any things at home that she plays with a lot that we don't have here
um we play with legos
let's see she actually her dad has an ipad and she'll play there's like animal games where you hit the card and animal will make a sound or there's matching games on there that she'll play like i mean like she can navigate her way through the different games on the ipad
yeah there kids are amazing like that these days
um i mean i don't we don't let her play a lot with it but she can do that
so the legos the dolls the only toys i have out for her are the legos the animals and then her kitchen and doll set are the only toys we have out
and then she's got like a basketball hoop and you know basketball and soccer ball
um we just bought a dollhouse but i haven't even put it together yet for her
so i don't have i try not to have too too many toys out for her because they end up everywhere
right yeah
they can be a little over stimulating and
alright well she did a great job today
she was uh i know she seemed just a little tired but she was great
she's probably not feeling too great
yeah she's not i mean this is she was stuffy but now it's all runny this is new
oh i have the trash over here so
let me see let me see let me see i'm sorry
um alright so we can um just give you we have two more consent forms for you to sign
um
another visit just to wrap everything up
how soon did you need next so my schedule really i guess it has to be me it can't be her dad they said since i'm the one that's been bringing her
what do we need to do now
yeah
i think for that it would be okay we needed you definitely for the play session but um i think it would be alright if we did those
what are you looking for
um yeah i think that should be fine
we've had a couple of sessions that like don't finish the last one or two things and i don't think it really matters because you're not doing too much with that like she'll just be naming pictures or repeating what we say
okay
so i mean yeah really it would be okay um in that case um
so kinda what i'll explain to you now is why we do why we've needed you kinda throughout
so um as we've been listening to her speech throughout the whole study but um we've also been recording your speech especially during the play session
um and this first consent form is just kinda explaining how we've already recorded your speech um and if you agree to participate in this portion of the research we would go back and analyze these recordings and look for things such as speaking rate variety of words length of sentences how carefully you are producing your words and other things like that
um so we do this for both your speech and your child's speech
um and so this first consent form is just giving us permission to analyze your speech when you talk to her and um so that kinda why we need to do throughout
um and then the second consent form um
this is another aspect that um we are looking for is there is currently an online database of parent and children's speech um but it's a little outdated so they are doing this whole update with it
um and this portion is entirely voluntary um but it allows us um to provide um your both yours and your child's data to other language researchers and other universities
okay
um so this kinda comes with three options that you are free to pick you know whichever one you want
um so the first option is i do not want any of my data or my child's data to be made available to other language researchers so it would just be available to us here at university of maryland
um the second option is allow anonymous transcripts and test score data to be made available to other language researchers so that would what we would do is we would take um both your speech and we would analyze it and do a written transcription of that and then that would be uploaded um
probably
dimmy wanna go see reanna
yes
you can go with amelie
you wanna go with her and go find reanna
go see reanna and i'll see you soon
oh yeah
alright so um what what kind of stuff what what did you start with playing today
the animals
okay
um
yeah i noticed he kind of liked those does he have stuff like that at home
yes
okay
anything specific that he really has at home
we have a lot of different stuff
we have little people
so it's got animals and it's got people and he really likes playing with the little things
the whole set
the imaginary sets
um
were there any animals that maybe he had never seen before
some of like i don't think he's ever seen the raccoon before
things like that and
eagle
he hasn't seen that
or a boar
we've seen a couple of times in pictures but it's been a while
yeah
um
so did he have any animals that were maybe his favorites
panda's his favorite
he has a pillow pet that's a panda
stuffed animal yeah
and what about any that he didn't really seem interested in
were there any things
um well all sort of different i mean he didn't care about the beaver and stuff but i think it was these were already out versus
eventually he gets to all of 
yeah
so i also noticed he um plays with food a lot
we have a kitchen at home
yeah
yeah okay
and i think that's because the older sibling
she plays with a lot so he does too so they cook together
okay um any foods that he uh maybe hasn't seen before
um
we don't have the beets or the green beans
he's got the juice
and the cans and things like that
yeah we've never seen that stuff before
so with his sister does he like to pretend to cook a lot
and they make what kinds of stuff do they make
soup
almost everything is called soup or stew or
something along that lines
yeah
and let's see
he didn't play with these set no
he has a couple at home but we has babies as opposed to i guess children
so he plays with the baby doll because he gives it a bottle
things like that but it's not as often
does he ever kind of dress them up like these are
he doesn't dress them up no
okay
so it's mainly like the stroller
the you know holding the baby things like that
right
okay
let's see
so um so he didn't really make it over to that side
no but we play with magnets and puzzles at home
but he we also have a preschool room
in the back and so
it's more of a select time in the day that he gets to do it
okay
um
um
did you was there anything we didn't have here today that he usually plays with at home
trains
cars
the usual boy
those are his favorites right now
trains balls things like that
yeah
okay
um did you notice anything about about his playing today that was um you know different from what he normally would do
he wasn't talking as much
he usually you know usually he picks hims him up and shows me and tells me things like that
but i think it's a lot of this stuff is just different and new
yeah
okay uh and did he did he go to anything that you thought you were kind of surprised he was interested in
nope
no he likes the food and the animals and
we have the same stuff at home so
okay
especially with the food it was uh
well and that's a lot of it is his sister
yeah
having the older sibling makes it so much faster
yeah
picks up on it and
she forces him to play
really she does
right
pretty much
so he plays with barbies
and things like that too
you know what i wonder if ila and the babies would you like to play bubbles with chelsea
chelsea can take the bubbles where there's room for bubbles
can you go with miss chelsea and play bubbles
for the bubble show
how are the babies gonna get there
mommy does mommy want to come
maybe the babies can ride in the boat
do you wanna take in the boat
all aboard
okay are you ready
can you put the baby in the boat
there they go
in the boat
yeah can you help go so they can go to the show
can you push 
show her that you're just gonna be right there
come on let's go play bubbles in here with the babies
right there
come on babies
you wanna push to me
can you push the babies to miss chelsea
you wanna bring 
woah good job
good job
we just have a little bit of you know talking about what she played with and what she's been playing with lately at home too
sure
gotcha
and let me see maybe the um what did she play with first
um definitely the food she really liked the stove
um and she liked sorting through the food and putting the food on the stove and
she likes to mix so she was happy to see the spoon
um and she really liked the pizza cutter
yeah
um so that was that was neat
do you have something like this at home
um we don i mean other than not a not for her to play with
um we have a pizza cutter but i don't think she's really seen us use it too much
does she have toy food at home
yeah we have um she just got a toy kitchen for uh for christmas
um and it came with some toy food and a little basket like that and oh my gosh she just loves it
loves it
do you have similar items to these
um they're definitely different but i mean we have some i think some cans and some um you know we have fruit
um we don't have porkchops or sushi that was new
um but um i mean similar things
we have cups and spoons
and of these what are things that she likes to eat in real life
yeah she definitely loves peaches
um and she liked the muffins
um kiwi i just got some um i was actually craving it
i'm due in september
um but so i had a hankering for it and she wouldn't try it
so hopefully now she'll try it that she saw it here as play food
but um she wouldn't she wouldn't try it home
well that makes sense
and um let me see was there anything that you tried to get her interested in that she didn't want to play with here
um i tried i think i tried this with the animals and she was
she was too busy with the food
um i thought this was neat
i think she would like this you know at another time if there weren't so many other neat things to play with for her
but um and she really liked the uh the tool bench i think
um
that was very neat
she was very she knew right away how that was gonna work
she's been really good with twisting and taking things off like um when i'm changing her diaper the ointment
she'll take the lids off the ointment she'll um
you know the empty ones she likes
um i'm trying to think what else
um when we're brushing our teeth we have an old um little toothpaste the baby toothpaste that had elmo on it
so when that was empty we kept it because she liked to take the lid on and off
and that helped her keep her occupied when i was actually brushing her teeth so
yeah
but she's been good with that
and um does she also have dolls that she plays with at home
yeah she just for her birthday uh my mom just got her a babydoll and so that's been a big um that's been a favorite too and a little stroller and she really likes she really likes that
what does she like to do with them
um she'll she'll take the baby for a walk um she'll hold the baby um she'll feed the baby she'll she'll give the baby a kiss to put the baby down for a nap and cover up the blanket
um she makes sure the baby has her pacifier and um
she's been really good she's been a nice good little mommy with it
aw
yeah
but she also liked our um our clothes
definitely
um yeah we don't we haven't um
she likes to take the jacket on and off of her baby
um but yeah she liked i think she liked picking out the clothes and and getting the baby dressed
um she has trouble i think getting she gets frustrated easy with you know getting things on and off so it's mommy do it mommy do it so
i've tried to uh well why don't you try and then i just know sometimes it's better to avoid the meltdown than uh um have her get too frustrated
but she you know she at least attempts it
does she like to um dress herself
um she yeah she tries
she um got a pair of rain boots for her birthday and loves them because she can get them on and off very easily
um so she likes to do that um kinda thing
she's been coming more and more independent on things like that
um but she gets frustrated easy when she can't get it
um so we're working on that trying to it's okay if you know we don't get it on the first try
but
does she have any favorite clothes have her own preferences about
um she knows what she doesn't like
she loves her bathingsuit
um but and she um i tried to get her for her birthday party tried to get her to wear a skirt and uh i had it and she's like no
so she's good at what she doesn't like but she usually doesn't
there i am
hi baby
i see you
you playing bubbles
so
um
is there anything that she loves to play at home that we really didn't see today
um she likes um she likes puzzles um
um you know we have a couple puzzles at home that really likes
um she has a curious george matching game that she really likes too
that it's like a memory game but we i just leave face up and she tries to find the match
um i noticed we we haven't i haven't used same often
but match
match is
we do yeah
so
i'll have to work on that using that but um
well that like i said that is a um it's a visual reception thing so i try to cycle through a number of
right
and then we also um she had it from the beginning
oh good
but often i just you know they inadvertently get one i i really react and i go
it's the same it's the same you said
you know i say it twenty times hoping that they'll connect that one
right
gotcha
it's it's just about really paying attention to the differences
keep it
so our toys are a little bit different than the ones that you've had in past sessions huh
yeah
what did you notice that he played with today
um he's always at the food last couple times he was at the food so this time he was at the food too
oh yeah
so um
the yeah i guess he mainly played with all the different plastic food
were there any items that were favorites of his
that he especially liked
um
i know last time he really liked the cookie and the pizza
uh it didn't seem like he had any favorites besides stacking up soup
yeah it's the first time i've seen that it was great
oh
yeah he likes to stack um legos and everything at home
yeah that was really neat
are there um any of these that are his favorites in real life to eat
no i've uh the pizza cookies
banana
he's had a birthday party recently so uh
yeah
um he likes cupcakes
yeah
that usually is is a popular item because many of them are fresh off that birthday
yeah
which is fun um do you have play food at home
yeah his sister does with like a kitchen
um but he doesn't get it out that often
but um
he plays with it at home
does he um like to help you in the kitchen too or
um not a whole bunch uh the kitchen isn't really baby proof that much so we like gated that the kitchen
so um
he likes to go in there and make a ruckus
ah
so
is there um are there any of these things that are new items of food for him
um probably the kiwis
um i don't know if he's been really interested in pie before
uh
the porkchop i don't think that really uh
the beets
he'd never seen it before i don't know if he's really seen a can of soup before
but he had an with it before what about the sushi i thought
yeah
oh yeah that's right yeah
he's never seen sushi before
but he said it after you did
yeah yeah
and not right away either that was interesting
yeah
i like that um in the beginning he seemed to be interested in a lot more different things
yeah yeah
he was interested in these guys and the animals he has some little animals like this at home
uh he'll occasionally play and like when he finds 
we have like a bin
well i think he picked up a few of ours which ones
oh let's see
um he picked out these guys here
oh yeah
so he's picking out the different animals
and then he was um picking out different animal plastic animals out of here
where has he been to see animals in real life
um
well used to go uh we were a member of the c s a and we used to go to a farm once a week
ah
so they uh the farm they just have uh chickens
sheep
and rabbits
so he hasn't been i'm tryin to think i don't think he's his sister has but he hasn't been to the zoo
yet um we have animals at home
oh
that too
just dogs
oh yeah
that makes sense because he seems very familiar with the farmer and
oh yeah his favorite book is um
uh little people and it has a barn
and you open the flaps
it's a different animals and you try it's a open the flap book
ah
so that's his favorite book so he would you know he goes through and says the sounds that the animals make
so he knows the barn from there
yeah i think so
ah that makes sense
and he also looked at the tools a little bit
yeah he has this at home
so kinda
are they the exact same kind or
well not exact same kind but different colors but very there's like we have um a brown board with uh he rudder blue screws but it's practically the same
ah
and he could do that and nut and bolt
yeah he liked
that seems familiar to him
yeah i i usually have to put it on for him
and then
that's part of it actually for mom to help with the put on
oh yeah okay
but yeah he'll screw them on and unscrew them
so that was really neat to see because he looked at it like oh yeah not like
whereas the beads were like ooh this is new this is interesting
yeah we've yeah he's never done that before
yeah
yeah well they're little and choky
cheerios maybe i i keep thinking they would
oh
maybe string and give a chance
and then you wouldn't have to be so
yeah
and nervous about it it makes makes me nervous anyway
yeah
um
lemme see is there anything that he really loves to play that we really didn't see today
legos
oh yeah
yeah he loves to put it together he actually just we have some quatro legos which are this big and then someone got him some duplo legos for his birthday
and then so we got all the ones we had taken everything choking hazard and put it into his sister's room
and so we pulled all the duplo ones down and so he's now on the little the smaller legos are about that big
the duplos
yeah
yeah
and so he likes stackin those up
and he can get them to click
that's good
it's funny because his sister you know i keep comparin to his sister and she was so verbal
and like he's the opposite he can um he's more mechanical and not so much as verbal as she is
so
it did seem like he had a lot of patience for you know stacking and
yeah he he stacks uh boxes to get to high places
oh lovely
to get to whatever he wants
it actually is it's lovely problem solving
you don't always feel like that at the moment
so can you tell me about what you guys played with today
the food
she likes to name things
so she was naming all the food pieces
um and she played with the babies
she likes to have all of her dolls naked
so she was working on that
at home they have none of her dolls have any clothes
that's basically it
um does she so at home she likes to undress them and then put their clothes back on
nope
just keep off
and then point out the body parts
right dorothy
does she um have dolls like this at home
like um kinda like the bigger dolls like i know
yeah the bigger dolls that their eyes open and close
with hair
yep
just the exact same
and then she has a newborn baby
also that she likes to point out it's little features
does she like to do anything else with them besides like undress them or does she like pretend to
um she carries around all day
all day
like that
like the dog
yep
exactly
she has one thing that she carries around all day
and then a purse
she has to have a purse
so she's gonna put that on like a purse
that's cute
hi dorothy
you a little momma
did you say that you had something like this at home when you talked about the food stuff
um yes now she has a kitchen
i had this growing up
she doesn't have this
oh
she's never seen it before
but i had the same thing
oh cool
but she's got a stove and a sink and she cooks
and she's got fruits
did she um she seemed to know some of the names of them so um does she eat any of these types of food at home
maybe has she seen like certain ones has she seen you eat or
yeah
she can name the stuff that she has seen and eaten
like obviously i mean you know
um
yeah she can name the stuff that she's seen before
the abstract stuff like she's not seen she doesn't know
so yeah
like she didn't know the kiwi fruit
she's never seen one
but maybe now she will know
dorothy what's this
what is that
is it kiwi
piwi
yeah a lot of the kids are like what is that
but she new like um some of the other fruit
yeah she's that's her phase is just like naming naming stuff
and holding it up and having you name it
and then she'll put it down
that's one of our games
at the moment so
doesn't surprise me
does she ever try to help you in the kitchen
like stirring up stuff and
yep
and she will bring the chair over to where i'm cooking and she'll push it over and then she'll get up and watch
so
that's cute
she's like a little homemaker
yeah
i'm not trying to get her to be or anything
gender neutral
that's just what she likes to do
yeah
um was there anything you tried to get her to uh play with that she didn't seem interested in
these guys here
the animal sorting habitat thing
i don't think she's really she's not done that before yet
so
i mean she likes animals but we haven't really talked about where they belong
did she recognize the names of uh most of 
um yeah like whale i don't remember her teaching her whale but she knew it
have you guys been to like the aquarium or something or
um
or like a farm or something maybe some of these animals she's seen
like some of she's seen
some of like she is in daycare a lot so
i'm not sure what i'm sure that she gets exposed to a lot of stuff there too
so maybe she learns it there because she knew moose one day
she saw a moose head
and she's like moose
and i know i never taught her
so
that's funny
um yeah it's just like picking it up as she goes
yeah
yeah
she likes to repeat
um like when we were doing you know the pictures she liked to repeat so that was good for us to help get but
yeah
and that's that's how she's gonna learn so
i don't think she did she seem interested in these other kinda more life like
does she have anything like this at home
not really
no animals
just food and dolls
do you think she's maybe seen any of them on tv
like i dunno if she
i feel like she seemed to know the names of some other ones too i can't remember um
i feel like maybe she knew more food names though because she'd be more familiar with it but
um i think through books
she's she learned an animal the animals
like dorothy what's this guy
what is it
like she knows this guy because i have a lot of richard scarrey books and so she knows the characters
which are also animals
so she likes to look at books a lot
a lot
that's her number one thing
yeah i was surprised she didn't go for this book
she doesn't like that book
i don't like it either
actually
i have it
it's not fun to read
the illustrations aren't very good
so it's just
it's sort of just like one of those books that everyone has i feel like but yeah
it's pointless creepy
she recognized like i she held up um i think she held the little moon shoes
yeah she likes moon and sun
i didn't know if maybe she knew it from there but yeah
uh she has a lot of books with like sun and moon and stuff in 
i don't think she went for the tools at all either
nope
nothing like that at home
well sometimes the real tools are sitting out
and um she will use them
like pry them into co into cracks and things like that but
not too much
this is what this is all she does all day
carrying around a purse and a baby
so she's right at home
does she have siblings
nope
i was gonna say if she maybe saw her sister or brother doing it
nope
but she's there's babies at daycare
and at the store i work at there's babies a lot too
she's just surrounded by babies basically all the time
and people caring for babies
yeah
is there anything else that uh was this similar to what she did in the previous play sessions
oh what was she what did she do then
well i guess it was kind of the same
it was a pile of food a pile of stuffed animals and a pile of books
and she would always gravitate toward the food
and
yeah but it wasn't like everything else that you did today hasn't done before
it's basically just the three piles of stuff and what is she going to play with
and it's always been the food
and this was no different
but there's just different food i think before
different food yep
i can't even remember what we had at the other play sessions
the other stuff was all wooden foods
oh is it
like all wooden cans and wooden pieces of cheese
i know everything in this session is very life like
like all the animals and all the and like they have the strangest foods you know that i think
yeah
yep
oh yeah i th i noticed with the like porkchops she didn't she was like
she's like chicken
yeah this all meat is like chicken
which is like gets her to eat it
same thing with vegetables you just kinda make it up
exactly
sure
that's a
is it a it's a pickle
of course
i wanted to get that to work too
it goes ding
i think it's broken
oh
alright well
yeah
is there anything else you wanna tell us or ask us about or
this is the last one
this is the two year old and done
yeah this is it
we're done
oh i'm sad
yeah i know
it's she's been with us for a while
i know
it's crazy
it's crazy that it's like it just comes so fast the last visit
i know
do they have other studies for older kids or is two the cut off for all the studies
oh no we have um we have a three and a four
right sean
there's a three and a four year old
um and then
i think there's a few around
yeah
yeah i think there's a few around threeish and then there's one we're doing in this room actually we use that computer
oh okay
you can do it either like three or four years old
so you can catch her at some point and have her come in if she wants if you want to uh bring her back
yeah of course
um so what things did you play with first
the animals
yeah he seemed to be really interested
yeah he was really into those
does he um have any favorite animals
he is really into he really likes dogs and cats i think is sort of probably
he has a teddy bear that he sleeps with but i think in terms of ones that he talks about probably dogs and cats
probably dog would be if he had a favorite
um that was probably what would be what he would pick
does he have so he has mostly stuffed animal toys at home
yeah
yeah we don't have any toys like this
what of these animals would he have seen in real life
um in real life let's see
we've seen some animals like the fish kinds of things in some aquariums but it's been a while since we've been to an aquarium
but he might i mean
have you ever been any place to see animals
well yeah we've been to the zoo but we haven't been since like last summer you know
um he's seen a lot of them probably in books like the the panda um he might recog
and these
okay well he's seen at the um super market
uh he's seen pigs and sheeps and uh cats and dogs at the frying pan farm
ah
um it's the park out in like mcclain virginia side of things
they have a sort of like a little form with cow horse goat pig kind of stuff
so um let's see
but also we haven't been there since like last summer
and the most recently probably the only thing he's seen are like cats and dogs
yeah
he uh learns a lot from his brother
he knows what to make them do
i think he had them there was some jumping and some
yeah flying and swimming and
does he like to swim himself
uh he well his brother's learning swim has is in swim lessons right now
um he's been in the pool a few times we have a pool with the gym but uh
he doesn't mind the water
i wouldn't know that he i would say that he likes it
but he hasn't been it in a again we haven't done that since like last summer
it's far away now it's like february
so it's sort of like does he remember that
maybe
um
are there any of these animals that you think that um he saw for the first time here
yes
yes he's never seen an ostrich before even in a book i'm pretty certain
um the dolphin he has seen in the we have this like endless ocean video game on the wii and so that has like a lot of fish
so i don't know if that counts as like seeing for the first time
well
so things that you've been observed exposed to in books or movies
or the things that
yeah or things that you named for him that you don't think he knew
uh that he'd never heard the name before
yeah
i don't think he'd ever
oh kangaroo
well actually possibly with winnie the we might have talked about kangaroos
um let's see
did i call the macaw a macaw or did i just call it a bird i think i might have just called it a bird
um the anteater
that's definitely a new one
ah
um the beaver the beaver i'm pretty sure is new
the moose it not because we went to the tetons last summer so we talked a lot about moose last summer
um the orangutan when i called it that he's not heard that word before but then i called it a monkey
i changed it
so he has heard we've talked about monkeys
let's see what else did he pick up
um ostrich is new i think i mentioned that one
he really was animal centered today
yeah we did a we did a lot of animals and then at the very end switched to food
but pretty much in every play thing that we've done here with this um longitudinal study whatever he's started with that's been like what we've played with most of the time and then at the end he's like moving to something else
so um
i dunno
i think he tends to like play with one thing for you know ten minutes or something before
that's amazing he's able to keep a focus for
before um going on to something else so
but he does like animals
he had at that point he had a choice of the dolls and the puzzles and the animals
is he um does he like to play with cooking things at home
we do have cooking stuff at home yes
um and he does like to play with it
so much so and his brother likes to play with it so much so that it's a reinforcer for potty training so it's not always out
oh really
something that's earned for like a certain number of days of potty training so
and does he have his own like cooking utensils or
we yeah
i mean it's they're not his own it's all kind of shared with his brother
but yeah we have pots and pans and stuff like that so
pots and pans and um fruit and vegetables
and some of the fruits and vegetables you can pretend to like cut up and things like that so
the nice ones
yeah
right yeah
and the pots and pans actually we haven't done it but they're supposed to be you can cook them on the stove but they're like little child sized ones
oh wow
that's exciting
yeah
although
but i think they have to be a little older for that
but once you start
i know
it may be that it's hard to uh
right
so i haven't started that yet
and is there anything that he plays a lot at home that we haven't really seen here
cars trains planes
all that transportation stuff is what we do most of the time
that's most of our time and reading books
that's what we mostly play at home
yeah that makes sense he seemed to really enjoy the story
oh yeah yeah we do a lot of reading
um especially now the trains and cars are also part of the
pretty much all toys have been removed with the exception of a few small toys and then books while we're doing potty training so that's kind of like what we do most of the time
ah
we're really my older child he's very admirable but he has a lot of time hard time focusing and like stopping to go to the bathroom and so we're like well if you're not gonna stop playing to go to the bathroom then we're gonna stop playing
until you've learned this
so much harder in winter too huh
yeah
i dunno
potty training has been very difficult for him
he's really advanced in a lot of other ways
so that sort of effects what toys wes has available they're all really close together
yeah
that makes sense
is there anything that you'd like me about anything we've done today really
so his articulation is the thing that's been kind of concerning to me it's feels like he has the vocabulary that's kind of age appropriate but that a lot of times when i'll say something and ask him to repeat it he drops a lot of consonants
i think it's hard for other people to understand him
he's starting to get frustrated and sometimes he'll start screaming if he says something and i don't really know what he's asking for
so that's kind of the one thing that
and i was wondering if maybe there's like if he's not hearing like low tones or something if there's like a hearing problem
um
does he have a history of ear infections
he's had a few but not like so many that he's had tubes in his ears or anything he's had like two or three
so not like so much that the doctor's been really concerned
most people too you know
yeah
i guess we don't really know
um yeah we need to sit down with the forms and look very carefully but i have to say that i thought i was finished with the pointing thing and he was i thought looking very carefully most of the time and making informed choices
yeah
and looking very satisfied
like oh yeah that's a
yeah
and i i had not expected to get as far as we did
right
based on the other one
we did also see that um he was willing to repeat some things for me
but um those are arranged in one syllable two syllable and three syllable
right
and most kids won't many many kids are nana kids
but you could also really see that for him that oh you just said how many lady you know
yeah
yeah banana he's said nana for a long and i've been trying to get him to say banana
no that's really normal
but
but you could see that as they got phonologically harder to produce he was less willing to give it a try
alright
he's very engaged with things
yes
he's he's very interested in everything
yeah well that's great
oh thank you
sorry
um yeah okay
so do you wanna just tell me he started with playing with um today
um immediately went towards the fake food
and he's done that every single time we've been here
so he loves fake food
okay
does he have fake food at home
um actually no
we don't have any fake food at our house we have a lot of little friends who do have the fake food
um we go to the library sometimes and they have these discovery rooms and they have fake food in there
and he pretends that his other toys are food as well sometimes
so we just decided to let it be a kind of an out of house fun thing so
that makes sense
yeah
um so i guess has he seen any of this food before
in real life
yes he's seen most of this food before
yeah
um so uh is there anything he hasn't seen before
um i'm not sure if he's seen um i'm not sure if he's seen beets before
um he'd never seen a donut he called the donut a bagel because that was his closet frame of reference
but i think for the most
he may not have ever seen sushi before we have a book about sushi though so he's seen it in a book
um but yeah for the most part he's seen all the food here
okay
so
um and you said he does eat some of these foods
he eats most of these foods
okay
anything he particularly likes
ice
he really likes ice he really likes pizza
um in this food group let's see he likes oatmeal
it looks like there was some oatmeal over there
um and cupcakes
he's not a great fan of greenbeans
um yeah he's he's a pretty good eater
so he really likes kiwi he actually went to the kiwis first and knew exactly what they were so
he likes those and he likes bananas and cookies and peppers
so yeah
he likes a lot of them
yeah
alright so i know he played with just about everything so um what was the next thing that he was interested in
um we kinda came over here and did the puzzle and animals almost kinda simultaneously but um
he we tr i mean i tried to get him interested in this
but then he only was for a a little bit
um i guess i was going for trying to get him to group all the sea animals together but
he was talking about the farmer going swimming so
uh so wasn't that interested
he was a little more interested in the animals we have a set very similar to this at our house um
so he he knows a lot of the animals
and he likes he plays with them a lot at our house
i almost think he plays more with the food when he's here because we don't have it at our house
but
i mean yeah that makes sense
uh
yeah so
yeah he likes animals
he likes puzzles but he didn't quite understand what he could do with this
so
yeah it's not a you know puzzle in the normal sense
right
kind of a
it's like a thematic
it's an ocean what can you put in the ocean
i guess there were we didn't get to the different backgrounds
so i didn't get to show him those
um so in terms of the animals were there any that he hadn't seen before
any new ones
um i was trying to get him to see the peacock
we a long time ago we did a coloring book with a peacock but it had been a very long time
so i was trying to see if remembered and he didn't say it so i don't know
but um i was gonna ask him about this one but i can't even remember what this animal is called so i didn't ask him
uh so yeah we don't we don't know what that is
definitely knew moose
um he would know an anteater
a dolphin
yeah most of these most of these he he knows
um he knew the octopus i asked him about the octopus
um he might call this a pig instead of a boar but
but yeah he's he's familiar with most of these animals either from books or possibly seeing them on tv
so
okay
um so what else was he interested in today
uh when we very very first sat down he pulled this dog over and said oh look it's a boy
and then he was interested in the eyes of them
he was interested in the the working but then when i was like oh let's dress them he was not interested in dressing them
uh and th but then before we put down he said well they can go to sleep
so he uh i guess kinda looked at them as if they were babies like okay we'll put them to sleep and then i'm going on to this so
so uh yeah he was only sort of interested in those
but and then back to the food for the cooking
uh he asked he asked several times to read goodnight moon
um we didn't make it very far in goodnight moon i think just there's so much else to see and do
i know
um is that a book he's read
yes
we have that one pretty much memorized so
um does he have any favorite parts of it
uh he likes i mean he likes the cow jumping over the moon he likes to he likes to fill in the blanks for the the sentences and then i guess the uh the little old lady whispering hush is always a favorite part for us
so
what's that
um let's see was there anything else he really played with
um he he liked the bowls a lot he liked taking the different things and putting them in the bowls
um and dumping them out
so
um but yeah i think i mean i think he played just with a little bit of everything
he played a little bit with the stove
i'm pretty sure he knows that that's a stove like what we have at home
yeah
so
does he like to play with the stove at home
uh yes
i mean he's ver he's very interested in me cooking and he always wants to help
so we always have to come up with ways that he can help without getting burned or you know spilling all over the place hot things
but uh yeah he's uh very interested in the stove and cooking and the chopping and that kind of thing at home so
okay
um was there anything that he usually plays with at home that we didn't have here today
um puzzles he really really loves puzzles
like th they have the board puzzles that have the different shapes of them where it's one shape fits in each one he has a lot of those
and then he also has he also has actual puzzles where you have to fit the all the pieces together and make a picture
and he likes both he likes puzzles a lot
he really likes musical instruments a lot
he likes drums and shakers and that kinda thing
so
okay
yeah
um and let's see was there anything you noticed today about his play that was different from either the previous one previous play sessions or anything
um he he pretends a lot more now
uh before he did shove the food in his mouth but it was just because he shoved everything in his mouth
now he's actually he's wanting to he's pretending he's eating something
he stuck a pot on his head he pretends things are hats
he uses his imagination a lot more than he has on the previous visits so
let's try not to step on the toys baby i know they're kind of everywhere but
um yeah i think that's the biggest thing is the using the imagination he had a lot more words to tell me what he wanted to play with so kinda even when i would tried and guide him somewhere else he could tell me no i wanna i wanna go to this so
so
so yeah he's
he still has fun
yeah
alright well i think we're just about finished
okay
i'm disappointed i didn't get to see more of the test
oh yeah
because i didn't expect to come back in and have him be finished
and have him be done
um but you know i looked over some of the scores and um i mean we'll we'll be sending you a full report
um but he he's looking good
yeah
okay
yeah
i i i'm feel like i'm totally biased as his mother but i think he's a very bright kid
he did a lot of um i know especially with some of the more motor tasks he was getting
he went very far in that
oh really
okay
yeah so um i mean like i said we'll compile those results
yeah
and um hopefully we'll have results out to you within we say within like six weeks
okay
um but uh yeah he was i missed most of it but it it from what i saw it was very good
and you did fast
you did quickly
and i
let's see i have
so that was that was the whole test there's
yep
wow
and she said there were two tests so we did we do both all two
um she'll probably stay over in that area
yeah
shift over here
oh
um
here let's bring this up
what happened
um so tell me what she was interested in today
uh the kitchen
and food
um is that something common
yeah
okay
she loves it
um does she have play food
okay
um and anything similar that she has
uh we have a lot of cupcakes
she loves those
um actually not much is very similar
so
it's kinda new
okay so was any of it new
most of it was new
um any any examples of things she might have never seen before
um the pretend food that looked real
ours is soft and doesn't really look all that real
um has she seen any of these foods like in real life
oh yeah
um she went right for the green beans
uh what else
cupcakes
the cans i think are very new to her
she wasn't exactly sure what they were
um so when she plays with food at home what kinds of things does she do
um she'll well we have a full kitchen so she'll put things in the oven and bring us food and feed us
does she have anything she loves to make
cupcakes
okay
um so what what are some of those foods that she um had encountered before like in real life
um well the can stuff
the meats
i guess the size of the um pie and pizza kinda threw her off
and then it was broken
i did hear that
um was there anything any food that was new to her she may never have seen before
um she probably doesn't remember a kiwi
she hasn't seen a peach unless it's cut up in front of her
so i think it's different contexts
or different size
yeah
um what about any um any foods that she plays with at home that we didn't have here
um mostly she's into the cupcakes
we have a couple different um when she cooks she likes to play with her tea set too so
that's a little different
yeah
she'll make us coffee
um so was she what else did you try to get her to play with today
um the book the dolls which i'm surprised she didn't go for
they might be a little big
she's more into the her sized dolls
and naked so
dolls dressed might have thrown her off
oh okay
um so does she have those at home
yes
she her older sister has that those more mature dolls and she has the she prefers the little ones
okay
um what kinds of things does she do with dolls at home
takes their clothes off
put back on
she is very um she loves to take them on walks and put to sleep and feed them
very maternal type things
um and does she like reading books at home
she loves it
yeah
and actually goodnight moon is one of her favorites so i'm surprised she didn't go right for it
i guess the new toys kind of
yeah
she was way too interested in the food
yeah
um anything else she wasn't really interested in
um the animals
i don't know i don't know if she really plays with them at home either
yeah
um so that's not really an interest for her
no
and i don't know if she knew what the um i guess they're magnets are
they're all turned upside down so
and they're beyond the food
right
yeah just that food was the draw from the beginning
yep
um so the kinds of things she's doing with the food today is that pretty typical
um yeah
normally she has a bigger kitchen and we'll be more i guess real life with it
she puts things in pots and puts in the oven
it's not exactly what we would eat at home but similar
yeah
um are there other things that she um that she has at home that we didn't have here that she likes to play with
um well she likes to dress up
i was kinda surprised that she wouldn't let me put the apron on her
um but mostly food dolls and dress up are her top three choices
we mostly have that but she's uh
yeah
very focused today
yes
um was this similar to the other play sessions i know we have different toys but um her play in previous ones was it similar
yeah it seems like she's drawn to one thing and kinda focuses
um do you remember what it was in a previous one
i think there was a bee with the crazy hair
yeah
she liked that
um and did you did you notice anything about her play that was different from maybe what she normally does
uh at home
um i guess she's more independent here
normally she'll be more willing to give up food
and serve
okay
um anything else you noticed that you wanted to bring up or
i don't think so
i'm a little out of it i don't have all my stuff either
cheese
yeah
mic me up
here
if you
us
okay i am recording just the wall that's good
okay
and um
yeah and then i know that our room camera is not getting us here so if we can move over here i'm sorry
oh sure
ah he's okay
as long as he's got a light to look at he's good
a field trip to the um ceiling fan department upstairs
cause he okay
um anyways so he loves the animals does he have any favorite animals
um his favorite ones would be the cow that he started of with that he picked outta the book um cows are are a big one elephants a big one
penguin and panda
ah yeah
and giraffe
and he was very particular about um the sheep and the goat i noticed
yeah actually cause um it took us a long time to get him to say those words
and now we have a farm book that that we can distinguish better between them cause he would he wouldn't say goat for the longest time
ah which of those animals has he seen you know in the flesh
the cow
the elephant
uh the pandas
um the sheep
i noticed you also mentioned um going to the aquarium
he has he has an aquarium in his crib
or oh okay
so a little you know an aquarium that every morning he hasn't done it lately but for months there it was turtle every time we walked into his room cause he wanted to see the aquarium
and in the aquarium there's fish and an octopus
oh perfect
yeah so he had those those were some of his earliest words so turtle he's seen live too
so we we have taken him to the zoo to see that
oh that's fun
he um he also played some with the cooking things
a little bit with the food
yep
um except that he he's into shapes right now
so instead of identifying the first one as food he would identify it as triangles
all the way through
yeah
and and then when you got to the ice cream i thought oh good night does he know sphere or cone
he knows cone but as a ice cream cone
but that was pretty neat
and yeah for that first part i'm not supposed to say what any of the names are i i messed up once
because he was so once they have said it i feel like that cat is outta the bag a little bit you know
he's yeah shapes are he is into labeling
which is why we're having trouble with verbs cause he wants to label everything
so he knows almost all of his colors
he knows lots of the basic shapes
um you know his basic numbers one through nine or zero through nine
and um the alphabet
so he likes labeling things yes and the
he likes that kinda thing ah
and when he doesn't here's the other thing when he doesn't know something he goes back to a word that he's comfortable with which in this case was clock
so whenever he went back to clock he
like you guys are kind of asking for a lot how about clock
yeah he wants to be able to answer whatever's correct
so if he goes to a different word than what you're pointing at he doesn't he doesn't know what it is
my son when he was naughty would start the alphabet song like look over here
yes by the way i know this
yeah and he's he's learned that pretty early so
we've been working with him you know we'll say it a little bit faster to give him the word
and then he's more comfortable with it the next time he'll start using it more often if we you know only ask once or twice what it is before
yeah
and did he um d you have this one look familiar
yup
does he have favorite parts of it
the cow the cow jumping over the moon
and the kittens
oh yeah
yep
and he points i was noticing he points to the things in the pictures
he yeah
that's kinda how we read the books is is you know we read the words on the page and then we start labeling things on the page
which you know at this point has been mostly the objects
you know the clock the fire things like that
um we're trying to put in action words now but that's not been as successful
well i i think that some you were doing a little bit of up and with the kangaroo too
yeah he um he likes to be entertained
so if we if we do if we're silly and make silly noises out of it he he has fun with it so
is there anything you tried to get him to play with here today that he was just not interested in
yeah he wasn't all that interested in the food as as such
you know i tried to get him off the animals and see if he would do something else
um
are there any of these foods that he you know likes to eat
the ice cream cone would ha been one of them
um bread
obviously the cookie from earlier he's a pretty picky eater so
oh
um
yeah there wouldn't be too many of them
and is there anything that he really loves to play that we didn't see today
um cars and trucks and buses
that's it that is his main focus
besides he is really big into animals too
um so he will play with those but if you have a vehicle around that will be right where he goes
was just thanking my lucky stars i know that they one more test with a vehicle every three or four and i'm thinking if i can just get there he'll be back engaged again
yeah he is he is so obsessed with those things
but it was true that
basically when when the therapists come to our house we have to remove all things with wheels from the room so that they can focus on something else
well i think that's what um the thinking was is that cars and trucks get you a lot of and not not a lot of other language which is what
it yeah yeah
it was just the first it was the first thing he was interested in and the animals have helped get him into other things
ooh do you wanna
little guy well that yeah
its
oh that's okay here i'm gonna cut everything off now
okay sure
i have a couple permission slips to ask you to sign
yeah
at that point yeah
it's like we had three of them
yeah
yeah
so
yeah
awhile
which is really great
and i want to talk to you about um what he played here and what he likes to play at home
yeah
i think you guys first started with animals
yes
and he was really proud of the ones he knew
um and didn't know all of them
but i didn't want to totally correct him
does he have animals
yes
um yeah i mean i think of stuffed animals but he has a few figures like that too
um but his favorite stuffed animals are dog and bears
he loves bears
and um
i'm trying to think what else
i'm not too sure right now
were there any animals were
any of your favorite anima
um yeah a lot of the wild animals
yeah the ostrich the emu
um yeah the i don't know if he's seen panda bear figurines before that was kinda fun
um so he
the river otter
he didn't seem to know that one
um and yeah a lot of them we've seen in books or heard their names or pointed to them maybe but it was fun to have them
there's tons of animals that you see in real life
yeah well we we've been to the zoo a couple of times
and then less than a month ago so for thanksgiving we went out to arkansas and it was more rural there with my husband's family
and he saw a hawk and he saw we have seen deer for real so i know baby deer
um and we saw racoons
um squirrels of course we've seen regular
um oh and we've been to the county fair a lot to see the regular farm animals
oh can mommy have some green beans
thank you
how nice
oh okay
thank you
so yeah we saw a lot of farm animals at the county fair
oh that's nice
yeah
and then he really was also interested in the
yes
um he helps us cook at home
we it got to i had either either you can cook or play with francis
um so he so it's more easy to combine them into just be careful around the stove and um that kind of thing and he'll he'll grab his chair to stand on at the counter and he mixes and he pours and he even pours um the hot water for his oatmeal for breakfast
things like that
so yeah he really he likes to cook
we don't have too much we just got a little bit of play food at home
he doesn't have much
so this was really fun to see him
is any of the play food similar to what we have here
do you have any of the same items or
um we have more finished play food i guess
like a cake that gets cut up
i know at daycare he likes to play in the kitchen
i'm sure they have different ingredients and stuff there so
are foods here which are ones that he eats
pretty much all of it
except for the one that looked like vomit
i couldn't tell what that was supposed to be
tuna
it's tuna
oh it's tuna
of course
well he does eat fish
um he's had ice he had it the other day
and the caramel topping i guess maybe we've had it but i don't it's not something we would regularly do
um he's a great eater
so the green beans he eats by himself
regular potatoes beets i'm sure he had in the spring or something when it was beet season
um so
and does he use um cutlery when at the table
yes he does
um we call it francis sized forks and knife and spoon
um and he doesn't have to he can use his fingers
um sometimes he prefers to do that
and then sometimes we supervise of course a little toothpick
to stab bites of vegetables
beets
thank you francis
francis i'm hungry too
oh
can you give your friend lisa something nice to eat
maybe she would like some pizza
yes
okay um so was there anything in here that you tried to get him to play with that he just wasn't interested in
no i really well maybe the habitat for the animal thing i tried to um say oh look you can play with the animals on here
but other than that i i kind of had a feeling he'd go for the cooking
maybe i directed that a little bit
i don't know
um but i just kinda let him do his own thing
and then is there anything that he plays at home that we really didn't see here
tried to
um
oh it is ready
oh thank you
careful it might be hot
careful
um he does play with more cars and trucks and buses and trains and stuff than we saw here
but but he talked about those a lot so
yeah
i think we also i think we get a lot of vroom
vroom
oh yeah
and then not not as many words
right
so for us those are not ideal
sure
sure
um but yeah i mean we played with the blocks before and he does a lot of block building and stuff so
i'm trying to think what else
i think that's about it
do you have any questions about
um was it only language based or was some of it intelligence i q stuff too
um well that's a trickier question
okay
it isn't we're we're doing language
right
and then we're also doing a fine motor fine motor and um kind of visual acuity
right
okay
same and different
right
and um those are both portions of a big group of test called the mullin which when given as a big whole they use as a stand in for i q test
but we're mostly interested in those we didn't do the whole thing
okay
we just do those little bits
more animals
there's some more in the other boxes
you can look
are there some more in this box
who's in there
alright
that's good i was afraid he was getting sad for a second
um and and those are to um remember in his little baby tests he looked at things on the screen where there were little blocks that move around and shapes
right
and so this is kind of the kids
no i was blindfolded
oh that's true i'm so sorry
well they should've actually shown you
no just kidding they told us about it
yeah
they told us about it
yeah
but um this is a kind of older kid version of that and the fine motor they see
octopus
expressive variant of that
okay
like the way that we did receptive vocabulary where you find something and we did expressive where you tell me what it is
yeah
um there's the visual acuity that's kind of expre um that's kind of receptive you saw the difference
right
and the fine motor is a kind of more active correlate to that
so we're doing those because they correlate to that
right
and then he also did the listening tasks
thank you
oh francis
can you put this back in the sink please
i'm finished
thank you
i'm finished
oh we could clean it up
thank you
yeah
and that's more what the language part scores correspond to
in particular the um pretend penguin names
yeah
where we mix up syllables and see
yeah that reminded me of one of the tests or whatever
so those things are supposed to go together
right
and then um we're absolutely at the end
great
okay
and um
excellent
and i have to send in those forms to you i'm really sorry
yes we want them
and we're really excited
yeah
um
um we we're proud
i think we are finished
it's fun to see how you know much you go through with language
yeah
and he's just been a delight
thanks
i have two more permission slips to ask you for actually
okay
okay
yeah
okay
sometimes we have the them stay but then if then
oh yes
and she can be
sorry
there's keys
oh you got okay
okay so i just wanted to ask you um about what you guys played with today
okay
so can you tell me about what you guys did and what she seemed to like
um mainly the food and the babies yeah
what did um
mainly the food
does she have
we'll see you in a little bit
you go for a walk
wanna go for a walk
go for a walk
lets go see
i have some more toys you wanna go see them
alright
was there anything that she didn't seem interested in in all
um
not much the animals which we have a lot of animals at home
so i mean she plays with them but she was very looking for the cow for the farm but
other than that
do we not have one
i don't know well i did a very quick look but i did not see
but there probably is one
do you think she would've recognized any of these
the animals yes
yeah
the bear she didn't but we don't
uh the bears that are like in books that she sees are mainly brown so i think that that's why she was saying that was a cow but um
she would definitely have known the deer
yes a lot of them she would the farm animals she would know
have you guys been to a farm or something
we have been to a lot of farms yeah yes
that's probably cow
and then um she knows panda because her brother's in the panda class
oh really fun
and
and the um some of the zoo animals she knows too because she has a play zoo at home
oh cool have you guys had a chance to go to the zoo yet
we haven't that she would remember
just
yeah i feel like cause sometimes they come in cause these are kinda weird
oh yeah
animals and sometimes i'm surprised that they know like a lot of the weird things
i don't even know like
some of these i don't even know the names of you know
well and we have a little yeah oh yeah the well moose she would know
like well this i think
oh that's a lemur
yes
someone said that and i was like really never knew
well there's a little people book too she's very into little people
and it has a lot of the like exotic animals that i would not know unless we have to read it all the time
is that like a you're just makin things up um that's funny
yeah yes
uh what about the food you said she liked that a lot
she does yes
does she have that at home
yes we have a kitchen at home
and they have a market
and so she and her brother
oh okay yeah
she knew like to you know get um she was like pickin out and put
oh yes and put in the
and she goes grocery shopping a lot with us so
least when her brother's in school
that's usually what we do
does she um does she have any of these foods that she might have seen at home or maybe seen you eat
um
i'm tryin think
she kiwi we just ate but she probably didn't see it that way
i mean she saw it all cut up so
um cupcakes we muffins we make a lot
pizza
she likes pizza
um mushroom she's eaten but probably doesn't um
and then she thought the tuna was batter because we just made a cake so but
yeah i dunno what else
and banan bananas she definitely knows
so she likes those
is there anything in there that she has seen that she doesn't like at all
so
um i'm tryin think
she seemed to like the sweets
yes she is a sweet girl um
peas she does not like
no
yeah
that's probably the main thing that she doesn't like
yeah
does she seem to be like into it like she was you know um mixing up the stuff
yes she and her brother make all different kinds of creation
and then they also play restaurant so they'll bring the stuff to us
and or they'll come and say what do you want
and take our order and then go back and make it and bring it so
that's really cute
so
how old her brother
he's um three and he'll be four in a week so
oh that's really cute
yeah yeah
has she um does she try to help you in the kitchen cause like she seemed to know
yes no they they do help me in the kitchen
sometimes
yeah she's like don't touch this
so i know i yes
my mom my mom's mom was german and so
the only word that german word that has carried through is 
so instead of hot my mom has always said to her 
and so she picks that up i think sometimes and so
yeah
so instead of hot she says 
she kept saying that and i was like at first i was like i wonder if she can't say the t
yeah oh
but then yeah um that's funny
so um and i think she probably started cooking with my mom or
we go over to my mom's for dinner probably a lot more than we should but
um and so when the oven's hot she'll be like 
so yeah there you go
that's really well she learned a german word
that's really cute yeah
um what about with the dolls she seemed to love those
she did yeah
and i'm surprised she didn't i mean
we played with them with the the thing
but usually i mean at home she'll like carry the doll put the doll to bed do all that stuff so
but she also likes to take the clothes off the dolls so
well i think she was trying to put wasn't she trying to dress one of those
yes
this one she was gonna put clothes on and then this one she wanted to take off so i don't
do both
yeah yes
does she have dolls like this or
she doesn't
most of her's are like baby dolls
so yes
like the one we saw
so what does she usually like to do
like you said she'll dress them
she'll dress the baby
she'll feed the baby a bottle
she puts the baby down for a nap
um she takes it for a walk
she has a little stroller for the baby doll and so
um she packs up all the stuff in a she has a play diaper bag so she packs it all up and then goes takes on trips
that's really cute goes to the restaurant with them
yeah
that's so cute
yes
she has a lot of good play routines going on
so
um did she seem to be
i think we have oh yeah like the um the screws and all that like the tools
she she didn't go for them
but she has i mean at home especially with her brother
um we have lots of tools around and she does um help him out to create things or build things so
but i think that just because there were so many things she just sort of you know but yeah
maybe too like yeah if she has this at home then she
right yes right
like the novel stuff is more exciting yeah
yes
yes
so and i'm surprised well we didn't get she didn't see it but she would've read good night if it were out
oh she has this at home
we have that at home she reads it every night with dad
aw really so she likes to read
yes
that's good
does she try to well actually she tried to read
yes
and she does this one
she knows um she actually knows i mean she's memorized this one so
she knows a lot of this part or the book
so she'll like
she'll she'll we'll or we'll say part the first part of the sentence and then she'll end it
so we'll be like um
well she her favorite part is a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush and the quiet old lady whispering and she goes hush
or she'll say um but
we'll do and two little and she'll say kittens
and a pair of and she goes mittens
so
oh that's cute
so she likes that book
yeah
that's awesome that she likes to to go through all that
yeah
she'll probably love it when she actually can read them
well that's good
yes
yes
aw
so
she seemed to have a lot of fun with everything
um lemme see
anything
is there anything here that you don't think she would've had experience with before coming
or pretty much everything
i'm tryin think
i don't i mean we have i don't know if she'd have we have like a mat that sort of has a farm on it
but we don't have things sort of like that
so she wouldn't maybe not know how to although she probably would
if we had had the right um yes probably not necessarily all the ocean animals go in the ocean
like know what goes where
yeah we have these things i forgot to show you
yeah and then the magnets
yeah like these they they um you can switch the scenes yeah i forgot to show that to you
oh and then they change oh oh
but yeah sometimes
some i i think one of the um one of the kids one time like was just throwing random animals
he like did it really quick he didn't get yet that like you know the cow can't really swim you know what i mean
right yes well
and the other thing right and the other thing is is that we have well we have little people stuff at home so she'll play
she'll have the barn here and the zoo here
but sometimes the zoo animals go and visit the people at the farm
and then the farm people come and visit the zoo so
and then at the national zoo they have the farm at the zoo
so that's kind they they have a farm part to it so um her brother knows about that cause he remembers that part but um
so it's all kind of jumbling yeah
yeah so so it's sort of like he puts it right near the zoo cause he's like it's part of the zoo and i'm like well yes sort of
not quite
not quite yes
i mean they know that there's another we've been to other farms where it's not like there's no zoo but
but yes he'll add it to the zoo sometimes so
i mean i'm sure she'll figure it out i think but
yes eventually
it's cute to see them kinda like trying to figure out what goes where
yeah yes
and i like hearing the explanations well no this can't swim here yet
oh yeah no
i like how she she definitely seemed to you know do a lot of different things and
she's she likes playing
yeah
and she has a lot of pretend things going on
like feeding you feeding the baby so that was really cute
oh yes
is there anything else you wanted to tell me about her play today or general or
i can't think of anything
alright
yeah
um so we're basically done
i just have a couple um i have two more consent forms for you
okay okay
you guys can come in and play we're we're done
alright
um just kinda like in the past where they just kinda asked you some like questions um
so if you just wanna kinda start telling me what you guys started with today
uh we started well he started with the doll
her in particular
um which is kind of interesting he doesn't really have dolls
he has stuffed animals
and his uh and uh but he does like he treated her the way he treats his stuffed animals where he hugs her and he pets her and he usually wants to
but that's what he does with the the stuffed animals
um if he tries to he he usually um comes to play with me when i'm doing something else
so when he went over and thought he wanted to be alone and i started trying to he came back and wanted to read a story so that's yeah i guess that's i dunno if that's i guess that's typical
so as soon as i do something else that doesn't involve him he's fine
um or he comes ba he'll come back and and start trying to play with me
um he kinda seemed somewhat interested in these in the beginning but he lost interest pretty quick
food
always a seller
always
play food real food
loves food
um he actually correctly identified four of them and i was sort of surprised at that
um well we usually just count fingers and that kind of thing and he knows the five fingers but not really you know not much beyond that
we're trying to get him to six and and the above
um i don't think he was really much engaged with anything else he seemed kinda fascinated with the shoes so i kept tryin to you know put them on the where do they go how do they you know
so they
so uh yeah so the shoes um
so basically i guess mostly more more so the dolls
and the um and the book because he does have the uh the goodnight moon book at home so it's something that he was familiar with
so
so he he likes to look at that book
he does look at this book at home
it's not his favorite book uh at home but we have read it to him you know on more than one occasion
um so yeah he's it's you know it's just something i think he was familiar with
are there any pictures in there that maybe he likes or does he typically turn to a certain page or
not with this book no
there's a um a book at home that we usually read it's called the pout pout fish
and it's the face where his the pout pout fish becomes the happy fish so that's usually his favorite page
uh it's when he put and then of course the one where he's the where he kisses the other fish and he likes that i usually kiss him when i'm kissing the when we get to that page
but
okay
you wanna go get them now
go get them and bring them to mommy
um this was interesting he doesn't have anything at home like this so you know the fact that he it it seemed engaging for a little while was sort of interesting also so
so he doesn't have anything
nope
uh he watches my husband do things with tools
so uh but he's never really shown any interest in them
i mean i guess because they're pro they're they're sharp and they are tools so we usually don't have him have him around them but he's ne so he's never really done anything as far that
you realize if you throw it you're gonna have to go and get it right
so um i guess of the uh i mean you showed him some animals were there any that he maybe hadn't seen before
uh there's a lot he hadn't seen before
he hadn't seen this which i think is a beaver
uh he definitely hasn't seen a moose
zebra he was he's familiar with
he's seen an octopus but he didn't really seem so much you know too much to gravitate to any of them
um and what about i mean he didn't food he wasn't really into but any food that he um hadn't seen before
um
yes mommy loves you too
that
the ki i guess the he's never seen it in its uh a kiwi in its uh original form
he's usually by the time he gets it it's on a plate and sliced up so
but i think he thinks it's a ball
but i think uh no other f no other food
okay now go get it
and try not to
oh thanks
do that
um and you said he doesn't really have dolls at home
no he only has stuffed animals
bears and a frog and some other items
so this was kind of new for him
yeah so this was just sort of interesting that he gravitate to the to the doll
my niece sometimes brings dolls to the house
but he never has really shown any interest in them either
and that could be because she just won't let him show any interest in 
so
so has he ever done i saw he was you know putting some of the stuff on the doll has he done stuff like that
he does it mostly to himself like uh he's he's gotten to the point where he wants to try to put his own clothes on and put his own socks on
so that's uh so it wasn't unusual that he was tryin put the socks on on the doll or the shoes on the doll so
is there anything that maybe he usually plays with at home that we didn't have here today
um not particularly
we we have um you know li i guess more intera like we have a trampoline at home and you know more the stuff that he he does where which we we try to wear him out as you can as you can you may have guessed
we just try to wear him out so his things are more um you know manuvera
which may be also why he was up down in the chairs and up down in that that's just that's generally how he plays at home
okay
no sweetie
leave that alone
colin
colin
colin
no we don't wanna mix up the toys
thank you sweetie
but no you're not gonna go in there
food
never fail
never fails
does he like to use like the kitchen stuff
not really
he only is interested in the kitchen if i'm in it
it usually means that food is coming
so
it's not so much the kitchen uh not really kitchen items
um no not even at home
no he's never been like a kid that bangs on the pots or anything like that
did you um i guess did you notice anything else today that was unusual or
pretty typical or
it's pretty typical of his behavior yeah not really uh
yeah no
i mean i i g he's pretty s i'm pretty sure as soon as i put him in the car he's gonna collapse over i he is sleepy i'm pretty sure of that
um but uh for the most part he he's it's you know his behavior isn't out of sorts or out of
he's he's a very active two year old with an attention span like that
so
alright
sure
okay
doesn't matter
um but if you want to sit here
um so can you just tell me about what you guys played with today
sure
we i let her decide kind of what she wanted and she gravitated toward the little magnet things first so
um
ooh what is this
um so we started playing with the magnet things and then i realized that there were several different categories there so started working on helping sort who goes where
um on the magnet things and then
she grabbed good night it's she recognizes it we have this book at home
something we read but shh reading wasn't really what she wanted to do it didn't seem like
well she was she started to it seemed like she knew most of the words
she does
yeah
um
and then got distracted by something
and
so i brought her back around to the kitchen stuff
we have a play kitchen at home so she's used to playing with kitchens but it doesn't look like this one we don't have any of the same foods that you have we don't have a little
um
separate uh stove the way you do so it's similar to what we have but not identical
um and then she just kinda i think she started not feeling very good she's had a cough for the last day um started yesterday afternoon
and so she just kind of got i think not feeling good and kind of snuggly
that's the way she gets when she's not feeling well
oh yeah what's that
yeah
but she feels like she's feelin a little better but
yeah she's doin okay
yeah
doin okay but wants to sit in mommy's lap
yeah
um so do you think you said you do have a lot of the same food at home so do you think she recognized any of these foods
um i think she recognizes some of them
um she certainly recognizes the pizza the banana um
the corn you know some of the fruit
items
um
but we don't have sushi
and we don't have lambchops
and so you know
we don't have kiwis
so some of the things i don't know that she recognizes
i'm not sure
what are these
does she eat any of these at home
um
yeah she eats the kiwis and corn and
uh she eats meat but not lambchops exactly
um she's never had sushi so that's a new one
um cupcakes yes and she knows ice and they've just had a birthday so
yup
so the cupcakes and ice were kind of fresh in their memory from having a birthday party recently
right
does she ever like help you in the kitchen
like she seemed to like
she likes stirring but i don't let the twins help me in the kitchen just i feel like they're a little bit young and my um
my niece got a bad burn from helping in the kitchen so i as a mom i'm just really a little bit shy of them helping helping out with that so
some kids like to help up like cake mixtures you know stuff like that
right
right i think they're a little bit young yet we'll definitely be doing that some in the next year but
but it's interesting they know what to do at the stove so they know what
they've watched it
exactly so
they love pretending cook and
oh thanks
um
yeah she seemed to like that
um
what about with the animals like did she recognize
she recognized a lot she's not i w don't not all of 
and some you know this she said dino for the rhinoceros
um
because we've been you know watching some dinosaur programs on tv it does kinda look like a dinosaur i think she's right um
but she recognized elephant zebra
um she recognized the sheep
and she recognized almost all the underwater animals
so yeah she knows a fair many of them
have you gone to the aquarium or something
um we haven't been to the aquarium but we have tubby toys that are all the ocean going animals so she's really familiar with those
ah okay
from that
um
or like has she yeah like she didn't play with any of these ones
thanks
no she didn't she gravitated more towards the mag the cartoony looking magnet ones than the realistic
yeah these ones are more they're not as pretty as the like the ones we have in the soft
more for big kids but
and some of these are kinda weird animals so i know a lot of kids aren't familiar with them
has she been to the zoo er
we've been to the zoo out in reston
um so it's more like a wild animal kind of thing than a
yeah so she's seen lions and stuff like that
um
um i don't think there are lions at that one she's seen the they have zebra and they have um
they have antelope and
um it's a petting zoo so they've got you know goats and things for them to pet
kangaroo
yeah she knows a lot of uh names so i was like they both have really big vocabularies so i was
it's interesting she knew a lot of them
and then she didn't seem to be too interested in the dolls i guess
no not so much
she was
does she have dolls at home
she does have dolls at home
um yeah
and sometimes she's very interested in that
she's um she's very maternal she tends to anything with a face is she'll
and sometimes she'll say oh he's sad and so just so that she can hug the um the toy or the animal or baby so
um
so no i think it's not typical that she didn't go right for that usually she does
maybe she has at home so she's kinda like
for me
oh
like pretend to dress them and stuff too i think you were trying to get her to but
i was and she doesn't she hasn't been doing a whole lot of dressing she does a lot of wrapping up in blankets and comforting them
and have and feeding them she'll do pretend diaper changes
but not so much taking clothes off and on
so other than that we haven't done that much at home
yeah she seemed uh i think she liked that once she realized it was there at first she didn't even notice it she was wrapped up into the animals i think but
oh that looks good
she seemed to like it
i think a lot of kids know this book too but um
usually when we see them play with it they don't like even never really see them name too much on the page so that was cool like she was goin through and she's like
the kitten or whatever i haven't read this book in so long
right it's
it's one of the ones that they pretty much do know most the words to it so i can you know
stop when i read and they'll give me the noun you know
yeah
works out
like does she like to read a lot
yes
yeah
yeah that was good she was actually trying to read to you a little bit the other story but i think she just got tired of it but
she can play with this stuff
i was gonna ask you a couple more questions about what you guys played with
okay
you wanna play with devon
you can show her these all the food
jordan this is devon
right here come here this is devon
that's my friend devon
say hi devon
hi devon
here show devon all the cupcakes you made and everything
look you think you can make me some juice
i saw you milk it looked really good
this room's a little weird to be in i'm not i'm not usually back here for this
right
okay so can you just tell me about what you guys did
sure
we um we started off over here with the puzzle
and she dumped all of the pieces out
and then um we worked a little bit on the habitats
and um and she picked different animals didn't quite seem to understand the habitat thing but um
but enjoyed putting the pieces on the puzzles
she seemed to kinda get it like when you were talking about you know
a little bit
and so we farms for um halloween and
and so we were able to see somebody milking a cow and like we were um able to see the pumpkin patches and things like that so
they've they know understand a little bit
yeah
um and so yeah we started off playing with that and then she wanted to feed the farmer a pizza and that got us over into the food
um and she played played with the food for a while and we started um
the sushi was a new thing to her so she got the sushi and um i described what that was and
that led us into talking about things that are shaped like circles cause we've been working on shapes at home
um so we did that a little bit and she spent most of the rest of the time with the kitchen and food stuff and at the end kind of seemed to wanna start pretending with the things that weren't around
the milk that isn't here and but she had a cup so she wanted to pretend that there was milk and find a fridge a pretend fridge somewhere else and she kind of went beyond what was here that toward the end
does she like to do a lot of pretend stuff like that at home
they're just she's just start she and her sister are both just starting to do the pretending
um yeah that that's really just emerged over their last month
so that's
that was really cute she like and she imitated you doing it too
that's good
did does does she at home does she tend to gravitate more towards the different stuff too um or
like
some yeah i mean she does we have a kitchen at home and she does like playing with the play kitchen um
she also she really likes books
so it's kind of a surprise to me that she didn't go for good night at any time cause she knows that book and um she's um really into books a lot so it's it's a surprise to me that she didn't do that
um but yeah she does like playing with the kitchen at home
does she
she pointed at it so i thought she would go for it so i was like huh i thought that was interesting
i thought so too yeah and
but maybe it's just cause that's old news cause we've read that book a million times you know so
exactly yeah
and she didn't seem to go for the dolls either which i thought was funny
no no not at all
and even when i said hey are you interested in feeding something to this doll or she's just like no not interested
is she not um as into the dolls as um
as her sister no she's not
um of the two of them allison is much more into dolls than jordan is
does she more like and she more likes to kinda cuddle things or
um yeah
allison is her sister is much um more maternal and you know more gentle and um jordan is a little bit more rough and tumble
a lot of times she doesn't even wanna play with any of the toys she wants to run and wants to have races and be physical and you know she's more more of a kinesthetic kid i think than her sister
she'll be a little athlete
so yeah maybe we'll see
yeah
i mean they both they both seemed to like a lot of stuff we had here
a little bit yeah
so um i then i think she was starting to get into the tools just now
yeah do you have anything like that at home
we don't have anything like that at home we've got um the cubes that have the different shapes that you fit things in which is a little bit similar to this thing with the holes
but we don't have one of the like play tool set sorts of things we don't have that at home
yeah some i think sometimes they're like some of the little boys like if i feel like a lot of the girls don't go for it as much kinda look at it and then they wanna deal with the cooking or something
right
um yeah she knew her shapes really well
didn't you
you know your shapes
yeah pretty much
i actually feel like i think you guys were talking she even knew like the difference between like the rectangle and the
yeah
she knows i mean it's not with a hundred percent accuracy obviously but she's starting she's starting to know her shapes
i think that's also why like they have they got they're getting so high too with like the the other test because i think some of the kids we've seen aren't really into shapes yet and
and that maybe helps their like visual they seem to have really good
oh don't put that in your mouth
these just pretend
don't really eat with it just pretend
yeah they seem to really you know do well with that
mommy will pretend
um
are there um any other i'm tryin think what else
ooh go look at that that's cool
anything different about like this play session versus the other ones i know the toys are different so
um
the well there wasn't there wasn't any pretending whatsoever at the other play sessions that was not something they were ready to do
um and i just think there was a lot more awareness of what things were at this session just because they're so much older
i feel like with the with the puzzles um they know they can identify what they're playing with
and in the other play sessions they were so young that i was doing a lot of here's what this object is and trying to tell them and teach them
and now it was you know they they know what these things are so it's more playing and so it's not just this is a cow but it's here the cow says moo the cow lives on a farm the cow is friends with the goat the cow you know you you just expand they're so much older that you can extend what you're doing
yeah they yeah
um into other learning and not just so be so focused on the vocabulary and more on the concepts that are beyond the vocabulary
yeah they seem to have really mastered the the vocabulary you know and i think they're ready to
right
you know and this is good you know they're moving toward like the pretend things and so that's really great yeah
move beyond that right yeah it's
it's it's fun
yeah i know and it will be more fun to play now cause you can do more
you can pretend to make food like you just were doing so
right
that's great
um well that's all i have to ask you about the play session
okay
i just have two more consents for you and then
we're done
um the last
so if you don't mind i'll just ask you
okay sure
a few questions
um if you'd mind we could take her out
i don't know
no that's
she's fine if
okay
okay
um so just kinda tell me what you started playing with today
uh she immediately went to the kitchen stuff
the food stuff
well actually she picked up the doll first
but then that way i think that was before we officially started
once you got everything out uh she was uh definitely playing with the kitchen stuff
okay
is that something she plays with at home
she just uh since christmas
has actually gotten a little twick
honestly i don't see her play with it much
but the nanny says that both the kids play with it during the day
so
um so what kind of things was she doing with the kitchen and stuff
um she was fascinated with this
which we were calling icecream
i'm not sure what it is
and then putting stuff on the stove
and picking up the cup
and
those toys
look at all these toys
hey madeline d you wanna take a walk
you wanna go see where i work
ooh
so shawn and mommy can talk for a minute
yeah
okay careful hon
there you go
d you want her to put her shoes on or
oh she's okay
okay
yeah
hey madeline
you wanna take the boy with you
and the sp and the bowl okay
um so yeah so she had the cup and she just kinda looking at some of the food items
and i think she thought this was a spice
like salt or something
she was putting that on top of the icecream
um were any of these foods uh did she have any of these foods to play with
um she's got a hot dog but its looks different
and um she's got fruit
but not kiwi
um so no
i don't think she's got any of these
okay what about um
she's got cups
what about uh foods that she actually eats are any of these
peas
and pizza
she didn't pick up on the pizza
uh
yeah
she will eat a peach every now and then
and icecream she eats icecream
for sure
yeah she would like that
yeah
that's like one of her favorites
um so yeah
wouldn't say oh cheese she knows the cheese and she loves cheese
what about was was there any food that she'd never seen before
yeah i don't think she's ever seen a doughnut
um
i thought this was oatmeal but she didn't pick up on it
this was supposed to be tuna
um she's seen kiwi but it's been a really really long time so i'm not surprised she didn't recognize it
um and is that a cupcake
yeah she's seen cupcakes
okay
so
recently
um yeah so she's seen some of it
but
okay
you said she played with
yeah well the doll that she took
the boy doll
okay
um yeah i don't think she has her dolls are not so realistic
so they're more plush
and soft
so um and they don't have clothes
okay
so she was really fascinated with the clothes and the shoes
so that was new
yes yeah
that was new for her
okay
so
so what kind of things was she doing with the clothing
um well she took the shirt off the boy
that shirt and um i helped her take his shoes off
and put different shoes on
and then she picked up the apron
here
she she thought it was a shirt
she was trying to put it back on
and um yeah and then she brought them over and put them in the little shopping basket
and gave him a little bag
to go shopping with
and i don't know where she gets that from either because she doesn't do a lot of shopping with us so
that was pretty funny
um yeah and when she's she knows green beans
i don't think she knows the beets but
um and she gave each of the dolls some vegetables
to hold
how nice of her
yes
so and then she was uh i think more fascinated with how many animals were here rather than any individual animal
did she pick up did did she really pick up any of them
uh she i don't think so
i don't think
there's none over here
yeah she just kind of dumped them out and then swished her hands through them
are any of these ones she might recognize
yeah oh yeah
she should recognize kanga and roo from winnie the poo
and the pig and the zebra
the seal i don't know if she knows that from books or if she's ever
the octopus i was trying to get her to say that
i thought maybe she'd recognize that
and the panda
she showed you the panda bear
today
yeah that's right
um and you know the birds
um that's a pair of
this one she might've recognized
she might've called it a goose though
so
and the sheep
ant
which i don't think she looked at them closely enough
yeah but she's making some of the no some of the animal noises right
well that maybe
that was in the book yeah
yeah
yep
yeah i remember hearing her do does she do a lot of that at home
yeah i mean we just kinda point out the animals and try to make the sound
so
and she had one of those fisher pri i think its fisher price um refrigerator magnet things
that has two pieces and if you get the right pieces it'll make the sound of the animal
and uh she picked up on that pretty quick so
she's been in
so
um so was there anything else that maybe you tried to get her to play with and she wasn't really interested in
uh no i probably would've gone here next
uhhum
um i was surprised she didn't pick it up a little bit
but um
there was
what was i pointing out to her and she didn't want to have anything to do with it
i'm not sure i think it was somewhere over her so it might've been just a piece of food
or someth
oh i was i think i was trying to ask her what this was
and she
uhhum
so
um what about anything um she plays with at home that we don't have here
uh whats
i mean she's
we had the crayons earlier
so she does crayons and water
water um
color paints
um she's got a chalkboard and some chalk
and so i mean kinda things like that
um she's got a kitchen
she doesn't really have a lot of these kind of animals
she's got a few
but not a lot
and she's got tons of stuffed animals
only a few dolls
and and books
of course that's
a few little musical type toys
she doesn't really play with those too much anymore
she's kinda moved on
so um uh she's got a stroller that she takes her baby for a walk in all the time
so
okay
great
okay
uh she did a she did a great job today
good i know she was getting a little uh antsy there
to me she was fine
good
yeah yeah
good
yeah it's
play with more toys
you want how about we can have some more crackers when we're all done playing 
is that good
yeah i think we can um
i have no concept of time
so we can um interview with you um
okay
get some more crackers and you can play with devon and um gonna talk i'm gonna talk to our other friend okay
do you want me to sit here
you need to move out of his way or anything like that
ooh boy what are these
she's gonna show you how this works
she's gonna show you
change the picture
look at this
what kind of animals live there
can you find the animals
can you find the animals
sorry
alright so um just kinda tell me what he started playing with today
okay so
he noticed the dolls first i think that's pretty novel
we have one that's like buried somewhere they're relatively uninterested in it
so he knows the dolls first but we definitely food is a big thing probably he's a little bit hungry but every time we've come in the food is interesting we don't have any
i shouldn't say we don't have any we have very little play food
so
okay so what was he interested i guess specifically
um
interesting he definitely recognized some of his favorite foods
and then he picked a couple novel foods like cheese is his favorite
right we have to like ration the cheese
um
and then like novel things like
and i think he was very interested in the really lifelike textured foods
the like rubbery foods were very interesting
um
what else
they're in the juice
drinking is a fun thing
he doesn't get he can but he doesn't get juice in a cup very often he's a scientist and everything has to go into the juice and it has to be poured and then
it's very messy experience
it's all about texture
right
um so were there any of the foods that he had never seen before
beets definitely and i don't think he recognized the tuna
which is interesting he's really interested like he could tell it was probably meat but
he's never really seen it like that before
a yeah the beets were interesting to him
for whatever reason i'm trying to think i don't think we've ever had beets
my husband doesn't like them
trying to think if i've ever just had them i don't think he's ever had beets
um anything else he'd never really had
i'm tryin to think
i know he's had pickles
i don't know if he'd recognize them
the mashed potatoes he's had mashed potatoes but it's been a while
potatoes are our late fall early winter food
and you said he eats some of these foods
not like the play food but in real life
yes
and um any specific ones that he
gree the green beans and the cheese bread and sometimes pizza not very often
we don't have it very often
um he didn't play with a lot of the other ones that he eats on a regular basis
the ice cone
and the peach
we have regularly
and does he like to pretend to cook and those kinds of things is that something he does at all
yes he has a little we have a little toy kitchen and he kinda rotates through it
like he's interested in it for a whole day and then he won't be interested in it for multiple days right
um he's becoming more interested in it lately like the last few weeks
probably uh before it was more like a push the buttons make the noises and things like that and he's starting to do more mimickery now like i'm drinking i'm pouring that sort of thing
he was making a what was it that you were making
an open faced sandwich
right
a tuna melt
sounded pretty good
yeah
except for the things that were a little uh
pizza and the tuna i don't know if i can go for that
right
um so uh what else besides the food was he interested in
uh he was interested in the dolls
um he was tryin to figure out what to do with them like how to even play with them i'm like what do you wanna do with the dolls and he's like i dunno
so you said he doesn't really play with them at home
not very much
yeah
like um our animal and people play has been mostly like figures
and he has he's heavily influenced by his older brother
as far as play goes he likes they like to play together to a certain extent
they're not always together they're not always interacting
um
so and superheroes are a big deal
to the four year old
yeah
so
those become you know valued commodities so we're playing with little figures mostly
little pilots and little whatever else
and heroes
yeah
oh so
so yeah not as often with a doll
with a doll
so was this kind of a new experience with all the you know
i think definitely with the clothes
like the doll we have doesn't have i should say it doesn't have easily removable clothes so they don't really usually bother with it
so that was something new he hadn't really done that before
yes
okay
did he seem interested in it at all
i think so
it was i was kind of wondering to myself you know like how interested is he actually in this i'm not sure
how much was intrigue and how much was i wanna do something with this
versus what is this and why is she doing this
why is she wearing a skirt over her pants
um was there anything else he was interested in today
i don't know i pointed out a couple other things and he didn't they were just not interesting as this so
yeah
yeah he definitely i know was interested in the food and that was a key thing to him
um
are some of these other toys things he has at home
no we don't really have very many animals
at home
and he is becoming more interested in animals but not a ton
tryin to think
yeah
oh
and um i guess is there anything at home that he plays with that he didn't have here
yes
definitely
okay so what
cars trains and trucks
the majority of his play
cars trains and trucks
that seems to be a common i mean
for boys yeah
we don't have any cars trains or trucks
there's nothing with wheels in here
i know
airplanes too
we have a lot of airplanes
which is interesting his i watch his imaginative play developing right now
you know where um you hear them making conversations and things like that in and day to day activities
but they're all cars
like talking to each other
and cars hanging out together right so they're like taking people roles and that's a very easy natural transition for him
yeah
it's kinda funny we have little people but he'll grab the cars instead
yeah i mean it's he's doing it
we have to personify them yeah
yeah
um
was there anything you noticed today that was different from um previous play sessions
um
definitely like the dolls he hasn't been interested in
the last few play sessions
he's been it's been like a what's that that's a doll pick it up put it down and then he's done but today he actually wanted to mess around with a little bit
but he's been very intrigued by the food
all the times we've come in
yeah
like it's hard last time i tried to get him to look at some of the animals and things and just
i wanna eat food
play food
right
um and did you um notice anything with his play today with maybe different from what he does at home you feel like
i know the toys are a little different but
um
tryin to think
i mean it's definitely it's always different when it comes to these play sessions because there's not another child
there and so that is definitely a different aspect like my one on one play time with him really limited
um
it's usually interrupted
like it's frequently interrupted right
so that and that that's different like that we can keep a train of thought and work on things
we're uh play through things
see them all the way through like we could have a whole conversation about the food
right
so did you notice anything else today that you wanted to bring up anything you saw or
i don't think so
well i know he had um
it was a little rough at the beginning but
tell me what um i think you started with the food toys huh
and what um what foods would have been familiar to her
um she knows corn
and she knows cheese
and she knows pizza
and she calls anything round like a fruit is an apple to her
so we just we just call it an apple and she'll eat it
um she doesn't know what juice is
um yeah she wouldn't know sushi
she knows green beans but she eats them pureed she won't eat them cut up for some reason
i'm surprised she doesn't
she al she also doesn't eat any sweets
so she d she doesn't like
good for you
so she doesn't know like she knows what a cookie is only cookie monster
ah
but she doesn't eat cookies she doesn't eat cake she doesn't eat ice or candy
is that just lovely parenting or is she just not interested
she just does we have tried
how interesting
she just does not want it
she doesn't want it
cheese and green beans are her favorite food
oh do you want to sit up there to color
you wanna color off the table
here
here's some paper
uhoh
here's your crayons
so um and she just got a kitchen set for her birthday like last week
so she's super excited about
she seemed about um cooking and
yeah
so she's really excited we've been having a lot of tea parties recently
so she knows about and stuff
yeah
and d would she eat pizza
she doesn't eat pizza
no
no we offer it to her and she doesn't like it
she but she has like a little um pizza that came with her kitchen set so she kno she knows what it is
but she doesn't like it so
she just knows what it is
how interesting
so yeah she has really weird um a really weird pattern
yeah
and then she was excited to see um the dolls
she has um a couple dolls at home
she doesn't really have a lot of clothes or anything for them but um she puts them night night and she feeds them and she makes them go potty and yeah so
she likes to do that
she has a little high chair for them so she sits on the high chair and feeds them and puts the bib on them and then
so yeah she's not used to seeing like all these clothes
but she likes her own clothes
yeah
can you sit please
i'm a little worried about that
here let's
can you sit on your butt
thank you
do you want any more food
do you want these apples
they look pretty good
there you go honey
um and she um she likes to run around
she seems pretty active
oh gosh yeah
yeah she um right now since it's winter it's kind of been a problem she is outside um when it's nice out she will stay out all day and she only comes in for meals and to sleep
so the child just wants to be outside all the time
and she likes to climb and jump
yeah she can jump and she climbs and she runs
and we go on long walks we go to the park a lot
several times a day
and her the daycare she was going to um is on an acre of land so they took them on like nature hikes and i mean she's just she's literally outside all day if it's nice out
aw that's so nice
so right now it's tough it's cold right
and she'd like to be moving
yeah
she likes to dance
does she um she also seemed to like some of the animals
does she have any favorite animals
she loves dogs
that's her favorite which is why i'm surprised when you pulled out the dog she didn't say like dog she normally she freaks out
um she likes dogs she likes donkeys and owls
i think are her three favorites
how interesting
and we have a kitty cat
but um and she's of course interested in the cat but
yeah because she seemed to know what the cat should do and
yeah yeah yeah
she knows the cat
um but yeah she knows a lot of animal noises and she she just really likes animals so
were any of these animals new to her
um yep
um she didn't know i don't think she knows what a um she doesn't know what a uh a moose
i'm trying to think of what some of these were
and like she doesn't know what a lobster is
an anteater
and she probably doesn't know llama
which ones did you um show her
i showed her she knew that this was um she knew that that was a bear
and i don't know if it was this one
it was one of the one i think it was this
she said it's a it's a bird
cat
she knows deer she knows chicken
hi
are any of these things she's seen in real life
um she's seen the cat and she's seen a deer
we haven't gone to the zoo since she's been like since she's been talking so
um yeah she knows a lot of the animals i think
yeah
yeah he likes animals
you do
and she seemed to really like those shoes
yeah
yeah she likes to put on and off her own shoes
you're a girly girl huh
and she did seem to notice the fashion possibility of my little
yeah
yeah she liked
those are cute
yeah aren't they cute
i think they're they're brand new to this set
yeah she likes to she liked to try to put those one
does she have does she have any boots
she doesn't have boots
no she doesn't
so she has um just regular like mary janes and then like tennies so
yeah she doesn't know about boots
ah she sounds ready to know
um is there anything you want to ask me about everything we've done today
um i guess you know how's she doing and
well i'll have to sit down
it's hard when they're shy
yeah i know
it's hard to know and it's just one number
almost ava not yet
and you know
that on a number of occasions she has had enough
yeah yeah
and then it's then it's hard to know know if if i'd asked that question first how it would have gone
yeah yeah
we're not going out yet
yeah like you showed her the corn and i know she knows what that it but shh by that point she was just done
some of those pictures i've found are very um like it doesn't always translate
yeah
there's a tiger like a just a little bit later and no child yet has gotten that tiger
really
and you know a bunch of them must know it
yeah
it's just a strange looking picture
yeah she does know what
or my or the phone is practically obsolete now
oh yeah she
so they don't get phone okay it's a weird old phone
yeah
yeah that's true
that's true
and then they don't get mermaid nobody does
and she actually has um other names for it
like she doesn't call the phone a phone
she calls it a hello
ah
when i pick up i go hello so she so she calls it momma hello
momma hello and daddy hello
like we each have our own
yes
hello
perfect
we're almost done ava
that makes sense
we're gonna clean up
let's clean up our toys
oh you want to
it's completely optional if you
it's time to clean up
okay
can you just tell me what he played with today
uh he played mainly with the food toy kitchen items
is that what he normally tends to go towards
not really
because we don't really have any i don't think we have any pretend food
at home
in the other play sessions did he usually end up going with the food or did
it's been a while now i don't remember
um he did some when he played yeah he did some of them he played with the food a lot
yeah these are like a little different toys so they're a little bit more like older i guess
right
so he tended to go with like the animals before and now
i think he played a lot with the toy food in the past too
um do you think he recognizes any of these animals
just knows what animals they are do you mean
yeah like do you think has he ever seen any of these
yeah like he identified the deer and the cat and i think he knows what the bear was and
we didn't really get much further than that
but yes
a couple from books and real life
have you guys been to like the zoo or something
yeah we've been to like the zoo and then also just more ordinary animals just around you know
you see deer in rock creek and
dogs and cats of course everywhere you go and horses
he's seen in real life and stuff so
he seemed to like the horse when i showed him the picture
yeah we just saw horses a couple days ago so
does he like to read with you at home
yes
i think today he was just distracted
yes
distracted and probably getting antsy
yeah
do you have that book at home
yes
we've been reading that one a lot too
yeah thank you it's a waffle oh thank you
i'm not sure what it is thank you
he seemed to be familiar with it like when he first picked it up
right
yeah he likes that one a lot right now
what did you say
so it's sort of all of a sudden he likes that one a lot
does he try to read with you or does he just kinda look at it
he tries to point out the things yeah
especially the balloon in that one
every page he's gotta show the balloon
and then sometimes he'll just pick up the books on his own or like when he's in the car seat in the car he'll just read books on his own
does he ever try to help you in the kitchen at home
like he seemed to kinda understand
yes
yeah
he does
i mean to the extent that a kid his age you know
but yeah
and he has his own drawer of sort of kid safe kitchen implements
he pays with like measuring cups and uten you know spatulas and things
yeah he seemed to he seemed to know what the stove was
right
and that it's hot
he kept saying hot hot hot
yes
he's familiar with kitchen stuff
does he like does he eat any of these types of foods at home or has he seen you eating any of this stuff
um yeah
occasionally ice cream
cheese he likes cheese a lot
corn on the cob some
yeah that's more cheese
um i guess i mean sometimes mashed potatoes or pizza or green beans
i don't think he's ever had beets
peanut butter sometimes
do you think he recognizes maybe the names of some of them
like maybe the one's he's eaten
yeah some of them for sure
i don't know
yeah
he seemed to know some of the animal names too like when you would point them out to him
but did you said he's more into like saying the noises and stuff
he mostly does the noises yeah
like for deer he says dee we don't know what sound a deer makes
um but yeah like for bear he's more likely to say roar
and for dog he says ruff ruff
so most of the animals yeah he'll
even though you know the books usually have both things but he latches on to the sound effects more
does he have anything like this at home like any little dolls
thank you
yeah he has dolls and stuffed animals and
some clothes
he's not really into changing their clothes much
at this point
but yes he plays with them and he pretends to feed and give water to the dolls and stuffed animals
tries to put shoes on them
things like that
yeah he seemed to notice like the pants were on but he he didn't i don't know like he didn't want to dress them but
no he didn't seem it may just be that there are so many other things
because like there's a doll at home that has one sock on and he's like uhoh uhoh pointing to the other foot so
normally would notice you know that he didn't have a shirt
yeah there's i think there's so much going on you get distracted
um was there anything else that seemed different today than like other times you remember
um
i mean nothing that i can think of in particular except of course that he's older now
he seemed very interested in the toy stove
was he was he before more like just kinda looking at stuff rather than kinda like using
you know what i mean
um i'm trying to remember his play sessions have been like months ago some of them more than a year ago
yeah i don't know maybe he was just exploring them more
he definitely seemed to recognize right away that this was a toy stove because he knows about our stove at home and that it's hot and that he can't touch and that these knobs he can touch and
he seemed to like that
he seemed to like the um tools too does he have anything like that
right
not really
i mean he's got some sort of like a peg board type thing you know where you put the shapes on pegs but nothing quite like this
nothing really tools
no hammering or screwing or anything like that
right he seemed to kind of understand the screw like earlier when he was
yeah he did he doesn't i don't think he's had any experience with that
i guess he just watched you and kinda got it
yeah he figured it out
so at home he mostly tends to play with like his dolls and his stuffed animals
um he plays a lot of different things at home
he has some wooden puzzles
we didn't i don't know if that's a magnet board i guess
he has some um he likes his puzzles
and then he has like a car and a fire truck and a little you know thing with ramps that it can go on
and then he's got like that um tupperware shape sorter you know with the ball
something similar to that but it's like you put the shapes and colors on the different pegs and
and blocks
he's got like the the big giant legos
the duplo
or the megablocks i guess are even bigger
and he likes to play with the blocks
and then he also does play some with the dolls and stuffed animals some
probably less the dolls and stuffed animals than the other stuff actually
and then of course running around outside is probably better than all that
yeah
he seemed to be pretty good with the blocks like making the tower and stuff
yeah we don't have like straight up wooden blocks that he plays with at this point
but um he likes to build with the duplo blocks
those are probably easier too because they stick as opposed to wooden blocks that slide
right they stay together
right
yeah those are more fine motor skill type blocks
right that's kind of what it looks at
fine motor skill
right
and the bead thing was really fine motor skill
i know it's he was trying i think he just got a little frustrated because it's tough to
once you get it in it's like yeah i did it
right
and then you have to pull it through
i find that some kids at this age really can't but some kids are sort of able to do it so i think it's one of those things that's just starting at this point
right
yeah
i think he's one of those who will not succeed at first and then get frustrated with it and go on to something else
do you have anything else you want to tell me about what like how he played today or
um
or do you have any questions
thank you
he's more he seems slightly more into having somebody right there playing with him
than he has in the past
it was more like okay here's some toys i'm going to do this productive thing right next to you or you know nearby while you do that and yeah
now he really wants somebody to play with him sometimes
you know he'll say sit
and he also
like he tries to help with laundry
like he'll get the laundry and try to stack it and stuff like that
yeah he definitely wants to be
he wants to be involved in what you're doing and he wants you to be involved in what he's doing
so
just like kind of the last one i'm just gonna ask you some questions about the play
yep
would it be more comfortable for you to be there or in the chair
um at the moment let me just stay here haha
okay
haha i'll figure out
i'll see if i can help with the shoes
so um we just wanted to talk about what you guys started playing with today
she was really fixated on shopping
it is sort of what she's been into lately
i think because while i had my broken leg my husband was shopping so they would go shopping together
and so she's into shopping haha
haha so she knows like they get cans
she wouldn't call them cans but she knew she need these and we buy cans
and she was you know gathering the things she knows we buy and you know then she went to get baby dolls which has been her big thing lately
and she likes to change their diapers
you know she needs her diaper changed usually
haha when she wants to change the baby's diapers and
and that sort of stuff
so that sort of made sense and then
she was into co wanting to cook
she tries to help cook at home so i could see that
and then we have a pizza cutter for pizza
so she knows that you know that we make pizza and you cut the pizza and stuff like that
but it seemed like all of these things she thought of them as items she bought
she wasn't interested going in the bags and you know like i'd show he you know you know ask her about the zebra and she would throw the zebra there and i'm like do you want to cook the zebra
haha but she wasn't really interested in what was in the containers which is kind of different then
well last time
ouch i just bit my tongue
sorry
last time we didn't have like containers or anything
they were just sort of loose and she would sort of
each times were different of what she's done with the animals
this is sort of the first time she's actually flat out ignored them
yes she's definitely very into the cooking and the shopping
so you said she watches you cook at home
yes
and she tries to help
okay
does she like watch you cook anything specific
or is it just
well like she know like the family makes pizza together so she knows about that
and then yesterday like her brother had a friend over so we all made fudge together so
i mean she just wants to help
like she wants to stir and that sort of stuff but
like we have an electric stove so i was sort of reminding her you can't have you know put your hands down and be careful with the pots because she'll
get burned
so sort of it's like sort of the thing that kinda of was the common thing was the thing she's interested in right now which is sort of playing with baby dolls and playing with cooking and shopping
and so
anything else beyond that is
i mean she likes books and all but i mean you saw when as soon as you pull them out first thing she'll do is the baby doll and she wanted to go play with the baby doll
so some of this food was there anything that maybe she hadn't seen before
new foods
no
well the kiwi is something we don't eat
and so she didn't really know what to do with it because she's trying to cut it and can't figure out why it's not cutting
but i was surprised she even knew it was something you cut because it's not something we eat
um i mean like the foods generally like
i was surprised she knew what green beans were i mean we have it occasionally at home but her brothers hate it so does her husband so does my husband so they're always like we don't like this and when she said they were beans i was kind of surprised
um but like you know the meats and stuff like that she knows
i don't think she has any clue what this is
haha yeah
yeah
i mean that's not something
that's fine
yeah that's not something we have around the house
so i wasn't surprised she had no clue and didn't even focus on them
i mean she knows
she didn't go for them she was just more into i want to shop so i mean she knows about cans and she knows meat and that sort of stuff but it wasn't like
and she wanted to put it in her basket because you know how giant has the little baskets and stuff like and the kids baskets so she gets all of that
does she have baby dolls at home
yes
and um she really didn't get into them until the last few months
like the last time we were we were here i guess at eighteen months
that's about the time she started to even look at them
before that she could care less
and then lately she's been more into holding the baby and changing the baby and feeding the baby
all that sort of stuff
does she usually like to put like clothes on them and stuff
she mostly strips them and then put diapers on and then you know walks around
oh and she likes to get diaper cream and she goes the baby needs diaper cream on her bottom
haha which is a little disturbing
because she's like gotta and she wants to put lotion on the baby
she needs lotion
she has dry skin
but she's like the baby needs lotion
and yeah
but watching her change the baby doll the other day was kind of interesting
she goes oh and i need to go get wipes
i need to wipe the baby's bottom and i'm like you need to go the potty haha
so but she doesn't really spend time dressing
it's mostly striping hugging kissing feeding diap diapering
but like this is the like putting clothes on is the most i've seen her do
putting clothes on because she doesn't normally do that
and were there any other toys that maybe i know the animals anything you tried to get her to play with that she wasn't really interested in
no i think she would have been more interested in this if she could figure out instantly whether or not it was a puzzle
um because the first thing she sort of said is this is a puzzle and then she's looking down looking for like well where's the design to put the pieces in and she's like oh there's the baby doll
where's the pot
yeah
i think she would have been more interested in that and then
she she didn't seem to get the tool thing
i don't know why
that was kind of weird
she didn't seem to be interested in that
she was thinking this was more of a bib
oh okay
but she you know i was trying to get her to focus on hammer and that sort of stuff but she's like where's the baby
where's the cooking
which is funny because she has older brothers and she plays
i mean a lot of her toys are her brothers toys that they had and just have kept them all
so she you know hammers on like the
workbench sort of thing
but she didn't seem to focus on it much
so are there any other i mean besides the tools any other toys that she has at home that we didn't have here that she usually plays with
um toys that she plays with
she's um into like the little she has a little um a little einstein rocket car so she kinda goes around the house and plays with that or she got like a trampoline for christmas
a little little one for her so she kinda plays with that now like she jumps on that
and and um
brother's play hockey so you know there's many sticks around the house so she does that
and she plays with balls
so then she kicks the balls and does that sort of stuff
um i'm trying to think toys per se
i mean she likes more the manipulative books
so like she likes these and you know she knows good night moon
but like santa brought her a potty training book that has like a little button that you know you hear the toilet flushing or um the thomas tank engine books that you know if you see the picture you push and you get a noise
that that sort of stuff she likes with books
i mean she'll usually sit down i think maybe she was getting a little
had a long day
was there anything you noticed today about her play that um was a little different from what she normally does or was it pretty much
it's more it's the the difference was more from what she did the last time we were here
i mean it's the play was definitely on what she's interested in now
it's funny like as we've done this the first time she was really attracted to color
like the bright stuff she was focused on
if it was red or orange or pink she was there
it couldn't she recognized sort of was starting to recognize food but it was more that the bright colors that's where she was
and then the next time it was more she was into the animals and things that she recognized and food and stuff like that
she wasn't how do i say it she wasn't putting everything together
versus now she could sort of see her focus on something and it sort of fits into a an area versus what she used to do
like she'll play with the dolls and like have something to do or she's like okay i'm going shopping and i'm doing all of that
versus like the first time she's like you know i see pizza
you know when she was talking pizza or this or that
but she wouldn't go and next thing okay let me go find the things that go on the pizza or let me go take it to the stove
the other thing is the toys are a little bit more mature too
yeah i understand that
yeah
because i remember the
these things weren't this was here before but this wasn't here before
as i mentioned these were
and i think there were little puzzles before where she would play with it
great
she did a great job today
we really we got through
she's polite
yeah
sorry she's a little piggy today
she's so sociable
you really feel like you can have a conversation
yeah she's a little quiet at first and then all of the sudden she just opened up
just talking and talking
it was great
usually she's a little
she goes through phases
sometimes she like when we first got here she'll be like you know hi you know
in the past and then i think you know she's getting through that stranger thing so she's sort of like where's mommy and then
which isn't bad
yeah
so um she can keep playing for a little bit i'm just do some gonna do a quick interview
okay
um so what was her favorite
the food
okay yeah she was uh stickin with that for awhile right
yeah
um does she have stuff like that at home
uh she does not have fake food
she pretends other stuff is food though
a lot
she likes food
yeah
um so were any of these foods things that she recognized
maybe either from like real life or
were they specific ones that she really
um the peas

i mean and the cookie and the cheese
um
she didn't say that was sushi but i know she knows what sushi looks like
um
and the cans of stuff
she was pointing out stuff that was in the can
the grape juice she said was blueberries but they look like blueberries
and so she was kinda putting a lot of stuff into a pot um is that something she does does she try that a lot i mean
she likes to put stuff into other things
okay
so does she ever pretend to cook anything like that
yeah
um
not with stuff that you would really con that are not things that look like actual pans and things like that that she pretends that stuff is
something is a pan or something is bowl um
and uh she likes to help cook for real too
oh
uh well
she likes to put coffee in the coffee maker
um
uh what did you help me make last night sofia
oh um
chicken parmesan she helped um
what did she help with
sprinkle the cheese on or somethin
um she likes to help make pizza we haven't made this in awhile but i used to make pizza dough all the time and she liked to help make the dough
well she would squeeze it and then she would pull off chunks and eat it
um
uh
anything that she can like she likes to help make salad you know anything that i mean i don't let her do stuff that has to be on the stove or with a knife or something but
um but just you know stuff that involves just like putting an ingredient into something if it's not like already on the stovetop basically
okay
she likes to sprinkle spices into stuff too
um and what else was she playing with today
well i mean i tried to get her into the doll but she loves dolls i don't know why she wasn't um interested in it but
and she also loves putting pants on herself and on her dolls
she wasn't she wasn't interested in it
um
i mean i guess she did seem like a little bit interested for like a minute but that was about it
and then this book
this is one of her favorite books so
she was reading that
um so you said does she have dolls at home
and what kind of things does she usually like to do with them
she holds them and rocks them she feeds them
um she wraps them up and dresses them
she pretends that they're um
she has a doll that she pretends is baby jesus
um
uh she pretends that they're not necessarily doing things she doesn't like hold them up and like say like this doll is dancing or something but she says she'll say
like baby whatever is
she'll say baby something or other is dancing but
okay
not she doesn't like hold it up and make it do it
are they similar to the dolls that we have or are they
no
these dolls are kind of ugly
but um
um hers look more like babies
and they're softer
i mean she does have dolls that have like plastic faces and arms and stuff but they don't look like this
uh do they have any i mean the dolls she has do they have some dress up things or are they
um well they do have clothes um
but uh actually most of the doll clothes are in her sister's room and she kind of emma kind of uh them
sofie doesn't get much of a chance to get but she does get to play with them or she'll just take like a um
she likes to go and like steal the dish towels out of the kitchen and wrap her dolls up in them um
or just like a regular blanket or something
um was there anything else that you tried to get her to play with that she was just not interested in
um i tried to get her to play with this thing she really likes zippers and she likes puttin stuff inside of stuff so i thought she'd like this but she didn't seem interested
does she play with animals at home at all
uh not like this she's got stuffed animals
but nothin like these
okay
um is there anything that she um does play with at home but we didn't have here
legos
um what does she have at home um
she has this uh rainstick thing
that she likes to play with um
she likes to draw
um
a lot of babydolls
um
she has like a bunch of toys that make noise and play music and stuff
um they have uh this um thing that's like a little radio with a little microphone attached that has ariel on it from the little and it plays princess songs
that's one of her favorite toys um
and uh she also has um this thing like you know you push the little button and little guy pops out and it plays a song
um and it's got like four across from sesame street
um
uh they have this big blowup dora house that my dad got them for christmas
um that they like to play inside of
um
um
uh toy telephones she likes
um she also pretends that a lot of things other things are telephones usually
um
do we have a lot of dog toys we have a dog
and she likes to play with those
where you goin
um so did you was there anything else you noticed about her play today that um was interesting maybe different or
i think she just liked the food and just didn't wanna give it up so she just stayed focused on that
and that happens i mean you said she doesn't really have the pretend food at home so that's something new and
you think she wants to eat a cupcake
you wanna feed it to her
maybe she wants a bite
are her eyes open or closed
yeah
she likes to talk about eyes being open and closed
okay
hi
oh okay
oh that's okay
so i guess if you wanna if he wants to go out and get some water or if he's fine just we're gonna do a quick interview
okay
oh okay
yeah you wanna keep playing with your animals buddy
okay yeah you can do that
um so why don't you tell me what you guys started with
oh well we started with good night moon because we have that book at home so he knows that by heart
we read it every day
so good night moon yeah
does he have any favorite parts
yeah there's he likes saying good night to the clocks and to the uh stars
there's another one i can't remember the other one let's see
clocks the stars and sometimes he likes the brush for some reason
okay um
here you go
so you did that
what did you do next
then we played with the play food
um we have um a less nice version of this at home
yeah tuna fish
that's tuna fish
so he plays with food at home
um yeah we have we have a shopping cart not a basket but we have a cart and the food
okay um does he er does he have similar foods like what we have
um he has some of the vegetables and none of the he doesn't have any of this any of the treats
but um the burger the vegetables and like a less nice version of the pizza
it is hot still buddy
it's still hot
um so were any of these foods were any of them new to him
yeah kiwis i know he's never seen
um he's never i don't think seen these chocolate bars
we didn't really play with those though
um pie
this kind of meat he's never seen
so and oh sushi
sushi
that's a new one
yeah
and he's really not exposed to that because i don't i don't eat it but my husband does but not in our house
so are any of the foods um things he does normally eat on his own
cheese
he really likes cheese bread he eats pizza
corn he'll eat
although it's usually cut up
um ice
yeah some of the yeah the peas the vegetables
and does he have any um kind of like what he was doing here with baking the food
does he have any of that at home
he just has um he doesn't have a stove or anything but takes the pot out of our underneath our counter and he'll play with the spoons and the pots
yeah
but we have this thing at home where he can't touch be near the stove when we're making dinner so that's why he's saying hot
good lesson
um okay what else did you play with
we played with some of the animals
so he wanted to dump them all so that's fine
but he he picked out the ones that he kn he knows the duck
he likes ducks
he i guess they sing e i e i o at school
that's new
that's rather new
he started to start doing that
um that's it i mean
i he really likes books so i was i knew that he would go that way first
he's not really into playing with dolls or dress up so
he does like puzzles so i was or thought maybe he would play with that but
um so any of the animals where they new to him
um yeah i think all the like these bear this bear the beaver this kind of bird
i think most a lot of these animals were new because he didn't really play with any of the farm animals so
he hasn't really been to the zoo in like a year or so
yeah
he knows a couple like things like this he'll know from books but um otherwise he doesn't really know them
and um you said he was doing something at school recently
oh the e i e i o
the singing the farm
they've taught they have like singing days that they do so i i know that that's one of the songs they've been working on so
and does he um does he know a lot of animal sounds
he knows cows um
what does a cow say buddy
yeah it's hot
yeah
he kn cow pig horse dog cat
those are the main ones he knows
he knows bear
if in like a book
like we'll say
but other than that it's mostly farm animals
and was there anything else you tried to get him to play with that he wasn't interested in
he didn't really want to play with the pan i was trying to get him to put the um muff the cupcakes in the pan but he didn't really want to play with it
and he didn't really want to go by the stove too much which is good
but now he's playing with the
yeah it's hot
the pan's hot
um and is there anything that you guys play with at home that we didn't have here
um all his elmo stuff
hot
here you go
um trains
he plays a lot with trains and um he has a lot of elmo toys like the type things he that he has a couple of those and blocks
so those are the main ones that he plays with at home
um and did you notice anything different about the way he played today than at other play sessions you've been to
he's been he's been more uh leading it i i not leading it but um i i guess interactive with me and he can now play more on his own
anyway by himself
it's great
at seven months old it wasn't
yeah it was like okay let's read more books
but no he's he can play on his own and he i mean he really likes the food at home so i'm not surprised and actually the first time we were here we didn't have the food and we ended up getting it for him because because of here
because he really liked it so
uhoh
um and did you notice anything else you wanted to bring up or found interesting
no i i kind of liked these things but he didn't really seem interested like they're kind of neat
so
so yeah
and he has lots of extra grownups so
yeah
love to do it on him and play with him and yes
oh great
um let me see what did he um seem interested in playing with today
um the animals or the food
are the two big ones that uh he liked the food stuff
you're right not the no peep from the dolls
yeah just stepped over them
that's interesting
um
and with the animals he um were there any that you thought were new to him here that you named today
um there's a couple that he was lookin at but he went he seemed to go towards the ones he recognized
and just wanted to name them rather than play anything in particular with them just identify them and carry them around
um does he have favorites
elephants
giraffes
yeah
yeah elephants are the big ones that he likes the best right now
are there um some of these that he's seen in real life
yes yes the dolphin
he we would we had a aquarium membership so he knows the dolphin splashes and swim and the octopus and he knows a lot of the water animals from seeing them at the aquarium
those are fun
yeah
i lived in san diego when my kids were tiny and that was really beautiful that
oh yeah the zoo is nice
this is a good place for the zoo too
yes
has he been to this zoo in
he's been to the philadelphia zoo a couple times but we're gonna make a trip to the uh national zoo probably this summer
the baltimore zoo is not it's not cheap
like you have to pay unlike the smithsonian but it's also got it's a good scale
yeah
oh okay
it isn't the national zoo is walking
lots and lots of walking
yes it is lots of walking
the baltimore zoo has got a lot of like places where they have little cages not so much for the animals but really nice if you're two and you have to get real close to check things out
oh that's cool
i'll have to check that one out
yeah we live out we live about thirty minutes away from philly zoo
so for us thirty forty five minutes we go up there and do the philly zoo
well thank you for making this drive for us
no problem
that's great
he also seemed to really enjoy the cooking stuff
yes
yes he likes the cooking stuff and pretending
does he have
he's getting one for his birthday actually
which is this week so
yes
yeah he's uh he's played with it at other people's house he does not have it at home yet
what kinds of things are in the set that you got
um it's got
pots and pans and food and plates and microwave and you know the whole kitchen and then he got a grill as well so he'll be able to do some outdoor grilling
the manly side of cooking
absolutely
the same thing daddy has to do so
ah that makes sense
um are there any of these foods that he likes to eat in real life
ice
cupcakes
yeah um fruit
that stuff
those are the ones he seemed to know and recognize he eats a lot
well he doesn't eat all he likes them
and were any that were new to him
um
yeah i guess maybe some of the like the cuts of meat and stuff of that
some of the can vegetables he probably doesn't recognize as a can of vegetables so much as
that actual vegetable itself
and you know most toddlers aren't big fans of
no the sushi he wasn't yeah and the pickles
things like that
he didn't i mean he knows pickles but he doesn't eat them so
ah
my favorite stuff
yeah right
now did he i forgot to ask does he have animal toys at home as well
um
yeah i guess he has a couple animal toys not like this scale but he has a couple of that he plays with occasionally
his favorite is trains
oh
he has a big thomas table and that's what he spends most of his day playing with trains and cars
so no not as far as the animals go
i mean he has a couple of but not a lot
so that is there anything he really likes to play with his trains is there anything else he really likes to play with that we didn't really see today
um
he really likes to play so like the trains and cars and runnin on tracks and stuff like that
um
and then the building the stacking the blocks he loves doin towers and stuff like that
those are probably the three things he spends most of his day doing
that makes sense
yeah
and um
goodnight moon was not a temptation for him at all
no he likes to read books a lot
but he has his favorites
and he
he wants to read those books
over and over again
and then he'll switch to another book you know a week or two later and he'll read that one over and over again
but um he did goodnight moon i guess he was into goodnight moon a couple maybe a couple months ago so that's probably why he didn't look at it much and didn't want to play with it
that and we did books earlier so
and i think that too there's a ton of
there's a lot of other stuff
done playing
we're going to take her into the other room
okay
whatever
whatever works
yeah
go see didi
yeah oh you think didi will want some
yeah
she will
go see didi go with
what's your name
go with devon she's gonna take you to see didi
okay go see didi
well i always whenever we play it's the same thing we just pull the toys out and she uh goes for what she feels like playing with for the day
she always likes playing with toys geared towards babies
um but there weren't really any baby these are like older i think she associated because it's small with the babies so um
but she likes playing with real pretend
pretend real stuff i should say
if that makes sense like uh cooking toys or cell phones her purse
um
she likes to play dressup
and a lot of that is dictated to by micah her sister she likes to play dressup so they play together
when micah's at school and it's just quinn and i then we'll you know we'll play with um she has the the stacking blocks that um have letters on so
she doesn't really stack more so that she uses them as projectiles and um
um just to have around she doesn't really play with the blocks i pull out all the time legos
she likes to stack legos
she likes to put together
and take apart you know
um nothing to build anything constructive that you can say oh look at the car
it's not like that she just likes to connect and take apart
she likes playing with her little she has a little laptop at home that she likes
it makes noise it's it's age appropriate for her
talks about the colors and then she always goes back to this one particular color because it has this one particular song that she likes and she knows how to i can't get to the song but she knows how to get
and it's consistent so um
but uh we have little animal toys
it's not very really fond of them so i put them and i kept tryin to get her to even look at the animal toys here and she's not into that
and then i guess that are they into things at this age they have what they like they have their preferences
but she does like cookin stuff even at home um
her aunt lives with us too um
jeremy's sister um
so uh she will say ooh quinny whatcha cookin
pretends like she's whippin up this feast and
like we pick up the pen and say bite bite you know she wants to so she has an imagination
we don't see what she's imagining but you know you can guess
based on uh but yeah i um
mich i'm just thinking micah did this same study not the the longitudinal part but the play
michah always would go towards the food
same as quinny you know it's uh it's funny to me and micah never really played with the animal toys now they're just so girly
they're so girly girl you know
they had purses
yes
and quinn won't leave the house that is she's like the purse purse you know she has to have it
so um toys like this don't really spark her interest
babies bottles her diapers she goes and gets hers
the ottoman where we keep do the hideaway stuff the the diapers she goes and gets her diapers and puts her diapers on her babies
so um but but these toys don't don't lend to you know um so maybe that's why she was stuck towards the cooking
you mean these ones are like a little older
yeah well
i know like these we we have model toys at home as well
she ne she very rarely plays with them if she does it's only because micah had it and then she'll want it but then she lose interest drop it and the minute micah picks it up again she'll go and get it
that kind of thing
but these are not what she likes to play with she loves to play with dolls
and uh with babies
so these look like
yeah i think these look like older kids but she didn't normally she'll be oh baby
and you saw that even the little baby that she kept she kept focusing on the baby
yes
that's what she does that's what she loves to do
um and coloring
and i've been tryin to get her to draw st that's not happenin
quinn is uh we call her baby g baby gangster she just does what she wants to do when she wants to do it and she doesn't care
but uh we say no
she's vocal about telling you
and with an attitude
where are you getting that from
you know
well it's pretty good about doin stuff she was getting bored i think
she's very good
and she's ver she's a excellent helper like i you saw how she was organizin the stuff
she's the one who cleans up
micah
we tell her micah clean up clean up micah won't clean up but quinn
and then like even when i go put my shoes on she'll go and get my shoes and say here mommy and she com she wants to help me
she's a helper quinny's a helper
um and a nurturer i think
and a bully all at the same time
you know
yeah she kinda
yes yes
and then uh she knows when she's cuttin up and she'll give you that look and you you'll see when you play back like the eyes and
um
but yeah she's she's an imaginative little girl um
and and neither one of them like we'll have the television on for background noise and we don't watch anything other than and at the time it was called noggin but now it's nick junior with moose and zee
those are you know it'll be playin in the background it's like preschool on television
so we don't watch like spongebob things stupid shows like that we don't do that um
if it's on it's on nog uh nick junior where she can
or on disney which has little einstein which is the exposure to the arts and classical music and dance
so she loves that they both um are big dancers
i mean and with rhythm and purpose
quinn
and uh so she'll be in this in uh car and i listen to w t o p mainly for traffic and weather but just because you know i don't like them mainstream music that has all the sex innuendos and things like that i don't want them exposed to that right now
um and um but if it if she catches a a small beat of like bruno mars she loses her mind
that is her man she loves bruno mars and i didn't understand that
but it's like and uh and no other artist gets that reaction out of her so she loves to dance and then um
this is her dance kinda move
this her move
you can't tell her she's not jammin you know
so
she loves dance she loves music
neither one of them are really up on the television unless it's their shows that they like
um backyardigans which is dance based
a lot good music and then there's a new one called bubbleguppies that's really has like funky kinda music that she really likes
toys
she would much rather come and sit on a lap and stick her hand right here and suck her thumb
she's just
i try to get her engaged in things and so we go to the library
and they have you know storytime and then like puppets and playtime and she'll she'll engage with that
um the chucky cheese uh big chucky cheese uh people that are in the the suit
you know in the the actual chucky cheese she likes she goes up and she hugs 
and most kids her age are real leery of that but she's not
so she's not too shy or
she's shy but with anima with animated um i guess uh avatar type animals um
like the disney uh goofy
like the you know people that she doesn't i think she knows her people i'm or maybe she doesn't
she's not afraid but like if you well you're pretty so it would not it wouldn't bother her but like men
um they try to come talk to her she'll shy away but in the store it's hi
hi to everyone
to everyone
and it's okay stop it you know
and then hi to the same person
hi and i'm like just ignore her you don't have to say hi anymore she's just gonna keep sayin hi so she's very friendly
but she's leery like in one on one situations people that she doesn't know
um
i hope i'm answering your questions
yeah no
um is there anything else like about the way today was it um any much different than in the other sessions like i think you said she
just that these toys are different see the prior to today's session each time we came it was the same toys
so um i don't know if you all do that on purpose just to see the progress i guess and
yeah these are more a little older so they can do a little more
right these are older toys
more with it
right
but she's not going to now she likes real tools which is why i thought she would you know flock to this but she was more impor more lookin at takin it apart as opposed to the actual mechanics of screwin the thing in and
but at home
you know uh we were doin projects puttin up ceiling fans and she just kept flocking to the to the screwdriver
of couse that's dangerous you don't wanna but she was like i you know yeah dat that mine it mine you know
um possessive of her things she does say me and my
and like i was tellin you i understand her
what she's sayin and micah even understands her better than all of us
but i guess they speak that language but um
her toy preference here you if you noticed she just kept goin to the food and to the domestic type and that's why i'm like
don't get too comfortable
don't get too comfortable
does she try to help you in the kitchen too when you cook maybe she likes
yeah
well she she does but mainly i don't know i think i'm like her safety blanket
and she'll just come and like when my shirt is is very loose she'll just come up and she just has to grab like my the fat on my belly
as long as she can grab it she's fine so i'm tryin to cook
and she's she'll just be standin there like i don't care what you're doin i just wanna touch you
and that's what she does
she's a mama's girl
um
and she's a daddy's girl too but since i'm wit her all day
um i try to engage her
we do the uh playdates uh at least twice a week
we try to fit in a third one but schedule's always commit but she has little friends that she plays with
and she hits you know we're tryin to make her stop hitting
and i just think it's she's not us she doesn't she can't use her words the way that she would like to
oh okay
okay so i'll just do a quick interview with you
okay
i'll just talk to you a little bit about what she played with today
um
but we won't do that um do you wanna start telling me what you started with today
okay
she went straight to the babies
and which kinda surprising to me because at home she kind of ignores her babies
okay
because she wants to play with whatever her brother's playing with
especially around babies so it was kinda neat to see her wanna play with them
i encourage it i'll be like oh let's feed your baby your baby's crying and she'll do it and then she'll like eh and run off and play with her brother
so i was glad to see that so
i know now when i have her one on one that she wanted to play with babies
um then she wanted to play with the magnets but she didn't really show much interest in that usually she loves animals
like she'll go to animals before the babies at home
we have a lot of these w that's why i was kinda surprised she went to the babies today first maybe she didn't notice the animals right away but
at home she'll play with the animals
and she'll like take little doggies and put in a little pen and play with them like that or things like zoos so
um
so then we did that
oh screws she likes
gabe also has a tool set so that's probably why she and he
at home i won't let her play with it so that's maybe why she wanted to try that out but
um so that and at home she loves to play with her kitchen set
and cook me things and she's always bringing me things she's cooked and
now so like yeah
that's why she really loves doing that so
um okay so just with so with the babies what was she really doing with them today
she liked clothes
dressing them yeah putting clothes on them
pretty much is what she liked to do with them
okay
okay
yeah
does she have any favorite things she liked i know there's different kinds of clothes there
shoes
that's about it yeah
yeah
it's what she loves
that's yeah
yeah she likes the shoes and she usually likes hats too she likes
so
but we don't have at home we don't have dolls with as much dress up clothing
i just haven't bought it for her yet i don't think she can play with it yet jus like i don't think she can't dress them and stuff so
her dolls mostly are just like those little babies with the
you know they look like little babies and they already have like the little jumper on
and she can't really undress it
okay
so
yeah so it's good to know she likes all the the things to play with
yeah it's good
yeah
um and then you said she wasn't really interested in the puzzle did she look at it at all
yeah
this one no
no
nope
the magnets yeah no she
i mean yeah
she wasn't too interested but
yeah she probably would need a few just played long enough she might've shown interest but
um and then you said her brother has the tools
um does she play with those a lot at home
yeah
she likes to sit and try to do the screws and hammers and stuff she likes that a lot so
okay
um and then with the animals
she you said she likes those right
yeah
do you have any similar at home
we don't have as big a variety and ours are a little bit bigger
like ours are like this big
um we have i don't know if we have an elephant and dinosaurs we've got bears
we've got bugs
some pretty gross ones we don't have this one but
we have a dolphin
and we have a penguin
yeah we don't have uh i guess we don't have the apple on or
we don't have the deer or raccoon
we don't have these wildlife
we have mostly jungle animals i'd say
nope um
yeah
we have a zebra
and a bear
yeah and sheep
we have a lot of farm animals too so
are you going shopping amelia
alright
she likes to do this too she has a shopping cart home and she wheels around and she shops forever she collects all this stuff in her shopping cart so
um so any of the any of the animals were they one thing she had never seen before or were they
in books or
definitely this one
i don't think she's ever seen an eel before
actually the one book we have does have an eel on it but it doesn't look like this at all it looks like a black snake
um
she hasn't seen
i don't think she's seen lobster i mean sure she's seen a lobster in a book but she didn't know what that was
and even the octopus that looks like this
all the kid octopuses look friendlier than this
and she's seen them at the aquarium but she i don't think she even realized
okay
but yeah
and then
you played a little bit with the food didn't really go over there
now she is
now she likes it but is that something she plays with a lot
all the time
yeah that's her that's what she loves
yeah
like i said she loves the cookie she liked it yeah she's always cooking us things we have to eat pretend to eat them and
you know she just plays at her kitchen set for quite a bit you know when she's pretend playing by herself
does she have any favorite foods she likes to
she puts all sorts of things together for us
we never know what we're gonna get
she really she does like these like little cupcake looking things because they're pink icing on top she likes those a lot
we get those often but
and
those cupcakes
and is so is there anything else that she plays with at home that we don't have here
she's she really
well you do have books
she reads books
and she um and she actually really likes like uh movement like train
she plays trains and cars a lot
so things she can push and go
she you've seen her she's very active
and so she's really on the go and so she likes things that she can manipulate
yeah see she found a wheel
exactly
um and did you notice anything else today that was maybe different that you hadn't really seen before i know she played with dolls but anything else
um
as far as the toys
yeah
some of the foods she hadn't seen the play foods like she hasn't seen play sushi before
and she's never had sushi before so
thanks amelia
aw there goes my sticker
uhoh

oh oh let's leave it on
yeah and um
thanks it's okay

did you make mommy funny
yeah am i funny
yeah so i just say something like the green blue she doesn't have like the fullest like
oh you need that realistic food
i have to find it on the internet
you know there's the
thanks amelia
okay
so nice
okay
is there anything else you wanted to tell me
play or was it just
um just
doesn't mean it's interesting that you know when i do get her alone she's really so much like a baby
i i don't know she
i just i mean i she um
she actually does go towards a good ball
i mean like
she likes dolls but i'm like maybe that's just because she wants to keep up with her big brother
you know and so i think it's interesting to see that but
um
yeah
otherwise she's just yeah she's pretty typical
okay
yeah
so edith you just wanna
okay just play with aiden i'm just gonna do a quick interview with you
sure
um
here
yah we can just do it right here
yah that's fine
um so why don't you just kinda tell me what he started playing with today
um he went right for the food
which is pretty typical
no he just got a kitchen for his birthday
so he's kind of in that zone right now
um
he plays babies sometimes
he's in childcare with all girls
so they do a lot of baby doll stuff
but i don't know if he's really into the whole dressing and undressing thing yet
um but yah he likes to make like he likes to pretend to make food for people
his favorite is
what's your favorite thing to make
cheeseburgers
and fries right
and then he loves animals but you know he doesn't really have a lot of
he has some jungle animals but he doesn't have a lot of figures like this
so i thought he'd think they were cool
but he wasn't really super interested in them
um
he definitely no very little interest in this
i think he thought it was cool but there was just too much else
um going on
right
um so you say he just got a kitchen set at home
yah for his birthday
is it similar to that at all
no it's big
it's um i mean the food is similar
the food looks very similar
but the kitchen it's like a full you know it has a like refrigeration
it's like i don't know
it's a stand alone big monstrosity
um
so was any of the food familiar to him at all
yes um he has those i think exact same pizza pieces
um which he picked out and said pizza
um and then he has cups like that
he has slices of cheese
we were just at port discovery the other day and made sandwiches in there
little del they have a diner where you can make a bunch of food
and he made sandwiches with cheese that looked identical to that
um and he has the whole hamburgers fixings and everything
so it's definitely some of it is familiar this is new
he's never seen that before
and that's actually what i think he was initially drawn to
was the actual kitchen sorry i'm pointing
but was the actual um implements
so
okay um and any of the foods are they things he actually eat in real life
oh yah he eats he eats most of this
he eats just about everything
he eats
do we eat beets
beets
yah he eats beets
he's had mashed potatoes
he doesn't eat a lot of tuna just mostly because i don't
um he's had pizza he's had kiwi
he's had cookies
he's had cupcakes he's had mushrooms
he's never had pie i don't think
but he's had hamburgers
um have you ever had ice
yah
he's had ice cream
um peanut butter and jelly
he loves so he um
so yah he definitely can identify with this food
not all of it but a lot of it
was any of it that you remember particularly new for him that he may have never seen before
this he probably hasn't seen
nini what's that
what is it
it's corn
yah i don't think he's ever seen anything like
like we don't eat ribs or you know
i don't even know if this is pork chop or duck or you know yah
i don't even know what that is
so yah that's probably new
and then the pie might be new
nini
what's that
pizza yah
so i mean he would
he's just associating
um
but juice peas corn
yah
green beans he knows
banana definitely
right yah
okay
do you remember what that's called
you've had that before too
sushi
rice
so he had that before
yah
that's a new thing for him
yah he i he just like i just take it apart and he eats the rice and vegetables out of it
loves it so
he's not using chop sticks
no no no
not even close
right
um okay so i guess we can talk a little bit about the babies
sure
so you said he
he wanted this to be his dad
i don't know if you heard that
his is daddy man
calls his dad
and um
but i think because the eyes are glassy like this i think he thought the baby was crying
so that's what he was saying over and over again
and um and then he put the baby to sl
he noticed like he layed the baby down and eyes closed so he put the baby to sleep
right
um and yah i mean i don't know
he he needed help putting on the clothes
so you said he really hasn't done the dressing very much
not that i know of
now oops now he might do more with his childcare provider
because like i said there's all girls
they have a lot of this stuff so
um
to be honest he's probably seen all the food there too
honestly now that i think about it
but he has a doll baby at home but it's not a dressable one
it's still kind of like an infant you know baby
baby tuck tuck
yah um but he does you know he pretends to feed and
he does a lot of pretend play with baby tuck tuck but not dressing
baby tuck tuck is in crib right
in nini's crib that's right you don't need him right now
and then um so he wasn't really interested in the animals today
uh not really i mean he wanted to find a horse
we found the zebra
but it didn't seem like he really wanted to play with them
so i don't know he was really about the food i think
yah
were there any animals you maybe tried to show him for the first time he hadn't seen before
um he pulled out a racoon
which i don't know that he has any prior knowledge of
so i um said racoon
but um but no
he didn't a whole lot with the animals
he didn't seem all that interested
oh my goodness
what is that
what is it
it does look like a spider
it's in the same family but it is a lobster
say yum
lobster yum
no it's not yucky
it's yummy
oh no it got mommy
is that lobster getting mommy
oh no
but yah i don't know
i don't know if it was cause they were all like put away
right
so they weren't out and i don't know but i think the food was too
so he was i don't know just not as interested in the animals today
food is so popular
yah i think he's probably hungry too because you know he's only snacked and hasn't had lunch really so
so was there anything else he played with
anything he wasn't interested in
he did look at this
well i kind of i guess i drew his attention to this stuff
and but it was just brief
um he heard me comment on it i think and then looked to see what i was commenting on
and um you know he just kind of tried to dump out
that's all he wanted to do
um
and then we looked at the book
he he is very familiar with this book
we play a kind of game with it where we try to find the mouse
so i asked if he wanted to find the mouse
he said no so we put it away
but then he did want to read the book to the baby cause it's a good night book obviously
right
um that's it
well great then we have two consent forms that i can explain to you and have you sign
i just wanted to ask you um a few questions do you think we should leave him to play with devon or do you think maybe we should take him out to get a break or something or
um
oh you need to take me out to
no i can sit with you and ask you but i don't know you think he'll be good here
oh no yeah i think he's fine
he's still good
so
alright so i'll just sit over here with you
okay
we don't have kitchen stuff at home so he'll play with the kitchen stuff all day
so he's excited
aw
so can you tell me about what you guys played with today
uh mostly with the kitchen stuff
he will
he also played a little bit with the um screwdriver
and the screws
mostly with the kitchen
you said he has something like that home like some kind of
lots of tools
he loves tools yes
so he plays with tools a lot at home um
and he loves putting things together and taking apart and
um
and he likes to help in the kitchen
so
i think he likes to play with the kitchen stuff so much he really likes pretend play like that his big thing lately is playing kitchen or tools or whatever
and he is he's very imaginative that like he'll you know pick up things and pretend that they're something else and
yeah what what he did with the banana
yeah yeah
like that
that's good
especially as a phone
everything can be a phone
what kind of things did he do like when plays in the kitchen
um
well he'll help me make pancakes or muffins or something and he'll dump things into the bowl and um he'll mix
and make a mess all at the same time
but he loves to just he likes to be with grownups watching what they're doing and helping and then mimicking so often times we're like why do we bother buying toys
because like he loves to help my husband vacuum
so
like if he's vacuuming and um
and nathan wants to help and you know he wants to get the vacuuming done first
um nathan gets really frustrated and upset because he wants to vacuum and so his first one of his favorite toys that he like really played with consistently was our swiffer
that's really funny
so so we shortened the handle you're able to shorten the handle and it was his like if tried to actually use it for cleaning
watch out
but yeah he uh
loves to do grownup stuff loves i mean dad's got his tools out he wants to play with dad's tools
so i'm trying to think of what else he really gets into
he likes to push his little lawnmower around so he likes to um do like with walking around toys like push the lawnmower like ride on he's got you know a little ride on thing that he likes to play on that
um and he loves his little cash register he got a little cash register for christmas and
i just got it i had one as a kid and it ended up being like his favorite toy for like a month
and he still pulls it out and plays with it
but
you do pretend to like give you guys pretend money or
yeah and then you can put it into the cash register and make it either go under the drawer or come out the cash slot and
so yeah he loves that
loves that
tryin to think and he loves his cars he likes to roll his cars around and
he actually um i was kind of laughing when you were doing the thing with the blocks because he didn't have a train for the longest time he's always he's loved always loved trains but like my mom and my sister had like thomas sets and i was like i'm not gonna go out and buy another train set you know when he plays with them in other places
and he would take his cars and line them up
and choochoo them around the table
and so um
he i mean he just
he does he enjoys his cars and he makes them into whatever he wants them to be
so lately we um my mom just got him a marble run for his birthday
i don't know if you've ever seen those but you like build it up and then you put a marble in the top and it like goes down through the whole thing and he loves doin that
so
those are fun
but yeah like and he's got a few little like car track kinda things that he can put the car at the top and it like goes down to the bottom and he gets excited when it goes whew
so
and he got excited when like the blocks would fall and he liked it a lot
yes
my si my nephew gave him his old crash and go cars i don't know if you've ever seen them but they they're these cars that when you crash them the doors pop open an the hood pops up
like the whole idea is that you crash that's like the whole point of them
and so he would just crash into each other and crash i mean like i actually had to hide for awhile i was like i can't take the crashing anymore
yeah
but definitely likes to build things up and knock down and he and actually we'll like play with like legos or whatever he likes to um pull apart like i'll build s i'll be building with him
and he just likes to take things apart
sometimes
so definitely has that male destructive streak in him
or likes to see how things work
yeah
he absolutely loves to see how things work
he really gets into that
we went to the childrens in pittsburgh a few weeks ago and we could not get him out of the area where you build your own fountain you like put pieces together and um it was like p v c piping or whatever we couldn't get him out of there
and there was a whole area and another section that was like an erector set basically
and we couldn't get him out of there either
like he just wanted to stay and build all day
that's really cute
put stuff together and take it apart
so
and you said he doesn't have play food at home
that's maybe
no
no he plays with our pots and pans like he'll go under the cabinet and pull pots out and we'll give him a spoon and he'll walk around and like play with the pots and pans and stuff
but he doesn't have play food at home
he's played with it at friends' houses and at daycare and at my parent's house and
um other places but he doesn't have like that was one of the things we were gonna get him for his birthday and we just
i don't know didn't happen
but um
but he enjoys playing with kitchen stuff
i mean as we saw with the blocks earlier he put on the spoon to put them back in the
i know that was really funny
so he really i mean he definitely
enjoys that part
he's always been fascinated in the kitchen
do you think he um would've recognized some of these foods
i mean it sounded like he recognized some of them
he did yeah like he the cupcakes he picked up immediately and said cakes cakes
and the ice he recognized definitely
um
there was only once piece of pizza but i know in the past he's picked up the pizza and said pizza
he loves pizza
i was surprised because he loves hotdogs
and he picked up the hotdog and called it a banana and i was like
i think it was just another case of you know it doesn't look like the real thing and so
and he doesn't eat them on buns either so
that might have been it too it was on a bun
true yeah
but um yeah he definitely recognized and he you know and and
big round fruit that he doesn't know what it is is an apple 
it's all apples
we love apples
so
a lot of kids make that mistake they're like oh yeah apple ah
yeah
well i don't know honestly like we've had peaches but it's usually been like the fruit cup of peaches you know like i don't know that we've had a fresh peach
since last summer and so
he has no memory of peaches
exactly
although he was eating nectarines like crazy the other day apparently when they went to the farmer's market with the daycare
but
and then how these animals did he seem to be interested in these
he didn't look at at all although he does he does like animals i mean when we go to the zoo or read a book or
um at daycare they've got dinosaurs they're the same kind of material but you know like the big dinosaurs
he totally gets into 
but this was more interesting to him today and so
and he will he'll sit and play with the same thing for a long time like way longer than i would expect a two year old to
but um and i think some of these animals are not as familiar to him like if it was more i mean there's some in there like some of the farm animals he would recognize but if it was like
he doesn't play with stuff that he doesn't recognize especially when it's in a big jumble
like all we he has a pile of toys at home that um
you know down are downstairs pile of toys it's just a mess and he doesn't play with because they're kind of like in a big pile like in a big mess together
he will play with his bucket of tools they're all in a bucket and like you know that's his tools
and he'll play like if there's something he can easily pull out like he'll do it but if it's a mess like he won't play with it it's like it's almost like i don't know if it's too overwhelming to or if he's
he doesn't wanna dig through it or whatever but he doesn't typically play with stuff unless it's like
sorted i guess is the best way to put it
well i remember you said like he wouldn't have liked to leave the crayons like a mess so
right
yeah
so he kinda just likes organiz which is you know this is all kind of just thrown on the floor so maybe
right
right
and especially when it's not something he's really excited about like i mean he's looking at the food and he's like oh i'm excited about this and i can play with this because it's something he recognizes
but like these animals he didn't recognize a lot of and they were all kind of mixed together and so i think it was just like too much to deal with
and the dolls too and he just has never had an interest really in dolls or stuffed animals or anything like that
i mean once in awhile he'll pick up a doll and you know hold it like a baby or something like that but
i mean never with stuffed animals
oh thank you
so he doesn't try to like feed like feed stuffed animals or anything like that he might like carry it around but
so i mean once in like once in a while he'll
um okay sorry
um but like i mean if he'll do that once in awhile but it's very very rare
he's more into like doing things and being like hands
yeah
heck yeah
yep
he also play still it's so funny like even like infant toys that we were about to put away
um he plays with them in a different way
now i'm tryin to think of what he was just doing the other day
but he it was a toy that we were like ready to put away and he did something with it and i'm like i so wouldn't have expected that
um but he'll he still pulls you know like the you know the stacking rings or whatever and like he'll do stuff with that kind of stuff and those pop beads i don't know if you've ever seen them but they're basically these big plastic beads and they pop together
they have like a hole in one and and then like something sticking out of the other and he still loves playin with those so i mean sometimes it's just simple stuff like that
oh
well if you said he's really imaginative like he probably just makes something up you know for what it is and just kinda goes with it
right
yeah
what on earth i'm trying to think of what that was the other day were literally like goin through his toys like gettin ready to put stuff away and then he started playing with something that he hadn't played with in ages
but completely differently than he'd played with it before
so you just never know
so in the past play sessions did he tend to gravitate towards the food or
oh thank you
yeah it was definitely the kitchen stuff because i think i'm tryin to remember it was books
food
oh thank you
thank you
and um stuffed animals
and the stuffed animals he had zero interest in we read a couple books here and there
can you go play with devon please
yeah okay
do you guys do a lot of reading at home
oh my he loves to read
i mean like this morning i had to like cut him off we had to get ready to leave
but he we my sister gave us this um it's a sesame street alphabet collection
and so there's one book for every letter and then there's like four other books that have like sections of the alphabet so like a through f
and then um
so but anyway so each one has a different story some of them are rhymy some are just stories some are just you know they're all very different but they've all got sesame street characters which he recognizes
we don't watch sesame street frequently he does a daycare once in awhile but like he always recognizes all the characters
and he's starting to recognize the letters i mean he just like everything's green everything's g lately
um but like i'll tell i'll say this is s and he'll say s and then we'll read the book and um
you know and there's like the k book it says which one of these things starts with k and he very frequently picks out which thing starts with k and he wants to read all the time
and they're board books so you know they're really easy for him to turn the pages and everything
i mean there was one time we sat and read twenty books in one sitting
like i just sat on the floor he sat in my lap and he would go and get another one and we would read it and then he would go and get another one we i mean it was amazing and like it's not unlikely for us to read five books at a time
he has a really long attention span then
yeah
and it's funny like i'll pull out how about we read this today and he like doesn't have interest in reading other books as often
um there's other ones that he does like to read but they're the little golden books there's been a couple of those like there's a train one
a fire engine one and a truck one
that he really gets into like all the vehicles he really gets into
um he loves there's a book about planes that we have and he likes that
um but otherwise like he just you know he really gets into the board books there's a prayer b a book of prayers like your first prayers book of prayers or something that he has gotten into lately i don't know why it's not a story it's just like page after page of like these short little like three or four line prayers and i'm like okay
will he sit by himself and try to read or he'll kinda
um
when we're home not usually but like he wanted to there was a book he wanted to read this morning we read two
and i said why don't you bring that one downstairs with us while we get ready and you can look at it and he had it and then he brought it in the car and he will he'll sit in the car and he'll look through it own his own
and then he'll try to read it out loud on his own
and there were other toys in the car but he played with the books
he read the books
and there were other toys in the car but he played with the books
he read the books so
he does really enjoy reading books and i mean when i've seen especially over the last like month and a half like watching his vocabulary grow
it's like tripled in like six weeks probably
and um
oh
did you get a cup
oh you got more goldfish didn't you
um
um but i mean in a i feel so much better about how much time we've spent reading in like i know that that's a big part of where he's getting it
yeah
and especially he's learning his alphabet and
so
i know he's he he definitely like he with the like i was saying with the um
visual stuff and the fine motor like he was you know he kept on doing well so we kept going going you know
yeah yeah
it's good he really
well and he really likes to count he for whatever reason doesn't like the numbers five seven and nine
he'll count
he'll skip them
he'll count to four
and then he'll go six eight ten
and and we've been i mean he'll like if we'll if we'll count with my husband and i always end up doing five seven and nine
like he won't do five seven and nine
but he gets real excited when we get to ten
so
i don't and my sister was tellin me that you know that at his age it's just to him it's just a sequence
so like for whatever reason like he never picked up those other three numbers
maybe he just doesn't like the way they sound
i don't know
that's right
so
but yeah he's um
he plays independently a lot
i work from home on thursdays and so you know i'll be sitting and working and he'll be just playin and he's totally fine like he doesn't you know need anybody to
and sometimes i'll sit down and try to play with him and he just he's like i'm doin this mom like get away
quit buggin me
yep that's good yeah he was pretty like just kinda doin his own thing with the food and cooking things
yeah
right
and he'll like bring stuff over to me i mean just like he did he like brings stuff over to me once in awhile and be like mom look or
he'll like he's got a like a fake wood at home like this and he'll bring it over and he'll hand me a screwdriver and he'll screw one of the screws and i'll screw the other one and so i mean he definitely has an interest in like being in contact with other people but he doesn't need attention all the time
yeah
like he definitely is very happy like doin stuff on his own
um you know but you know he definitely appreciates having a conversation you know every so often just
like hey we're still here
we love you we care about you you know
but he does i mean and sometimes he doesn't want anyone else to play with him
and he knows that he has a new sibling coming
well we've been talking about it i don't know how much he realizes but
that'll be exciting
yeah we'll see
we'll see how the sharing goes
there's another boy at daycare and ugh it's been a headache lately they're both two and
yeah
well luckily at first
lots of hitting and pushing and snatching toys
well
maybe since the baby you know will be a little more
right
you know by himself or
is it a girl
girl
yeah
oh oh cute
congratulations
thank you
yeah i mean he's there's been a baby at daycare and he's got a cousin who's a baby and so we've talked a lot about the baby and like when we're around his cousin we'll be like look there's a baby in mommy's belly too we're gonna have a baby sister just like natalie you know we'll try to
talk about it and that way and um
and he and he's very gentle with babies too like he's very good about like you know touching gently and he helps feed the bottles like he loves to do that so i mean
there's definitely like there's definitely a nurturing side of him
he's very nurturing
i don't know how he's gonna respond when he realizes that the baby gets some of the attention that he normally does the good news is that since he does play so independently you know i'm hoping that that's
a little bit easier transition
yeah i mean he'll still have to get used to it but i feel like it sounds like he's pretty good about doing his own thing you know
makin his own food and just kinda
yeah
yep
you know playin himself so
he is
he is
um
do you think i should try to finish it up we're basically done with it it's just
devon's gonna help you dress your dolls okay
i think he needs some shoes
i'm gonna just talk to mommy for a minute
look
i think his shoes are missing
okay
sorry
um so can you tell me about um what you guys played with today
um we played with
she does a lot of the same things at home
um the playing with the food and cooking pretending to cook
um and she does she doesn't dress the babydolls at home as much
oh really
but we don't have as many clothes but she likes to like at home she likes to put to sleep cover with blankets
and um she has one that sits on the potty and everything so
she does that
she doesn't do as much of the dressing so
that was new for her
so today she was helping you like put the boots on and stuff
should we move you guys over a little bit
okay
um so you said at home she mostly will put them to sleep and stuff so today that was like a brand new thing
oh that's cool
yep
and then you said you have toy food at home
yeah she has the toy food and she has like the little sink or yeah the stove and refrigerator with a bunch of play food so
she enjoys that
she just got it for her birthday so
oh so just the other day
it's new too
yeah
does she do the same kind of things like putting in the pan and stuff
yeah and then she tries to share it with everybody so
yeah
do you think she recognizes some of these foods
i think so
yeah
i mean some of them were are unfamiliar
but but i know she recognized the peas and the corn
a lot of the vegetables are common to her but she probably doesn't recognize some of these other things
she definitely recognized the ice
so
do you think she um the ones that you showed her like has she ever seen you eat any of them maybe like some of the ones like the kind of different kinds of foods
yeah like the sushi she's never had herself
but she's seen us eat it
and then she's never seen a kiwi i don't think
um
but yeah i mean i think most of them are familiar to her
so
does she try to ever help you in the kitchen like stirring stuff and
oh yes
yes she does
yeah she um sometimes too much
yeah that's fine
what were you saying sometimes what
sometimes she helps a lot
like i mean things like baking cookies she she's really helpful with
but when it's something hot no
yeah
i'm a little nervous to have her help
you wanna go see the fountain
we'll save the barn for you right here
okay
you come back
um so she likes to help you like try to mix up stuff
yeah
yeah
so she she's pretty helpful with anything i let her try so
yeah
yeah she seemed to know what the stove was and know that
i don't think did she try to cook on it at all though
uh she turned the dials but i think that was her pretending too
and then with the animals did you you tried to get her to play with it but
yeah i called her attention to it but she didn't really seem that interested
um at home she plays with dinosaurs like this
and she loves that
so she's really into dinosaurs
but um i guess she's never seen this size of all those animals
i'm not sure why she wasn't interested in those but
maybe just the foods were exciting for now
yeah
yeah
food and the dolls so
well and these are all new so
yeah
from the other visits
yeah
did she do kind of similar things to um what she did in the other visits
uh no it seemed like everything's changed developmentally like
i mean before she would just like pick up the food and like try to put in her mouth and now she's pretending to cook and um
and she wasn't even interested in the dolls last time
she didn't really care about them
and now clearly she does
so
yeah she probably would have gone straight for just the food last time
and maybe the animals but not actually like playing with them
now i imagine she would have like lined up and like played with and pretend they're eating things and things like that so
that's what she does at home
so at home you said she doesn't have those
with it
she doesn't have those
she like lines up her dinosaurs and then pretends they're eating from the trees and things like that
so
i think the other visits it was like stuffed animals
like more baby
yeah
do you think she would recognize um any of these animals
like have you ever been to the aquarium or like
yes
she probably would
i mean maybe not these but like definitely the zebra and the panda
and definitely the pig
if there's a tiger in here somewhere she'd recogni
yeah
so probably about half of them she'd recognize
have you guys been to the zoo or something
yeah and we read a lot of animals
animal books
so
she likes to read a lot with you
yeah
oh yeah that's like one of her favorite things to do
so
i don't know if she was interested in this book i don't know
she has it at home
so maybe it was just she had seen it already so
well and there's i think at the other visits there was more there were more books and today there's just this one
do you guys does she um do you guys read like every day
oh yes
that's we spend a lot o we probably read for about a at least an hour a day
she loves it so much
yeah
so um
and actually she'll her favorite books that she likes to hear all the time over and over again she's actually memorized a lot of the words
so yes
she she enjoys reading a lot
that's good
um is there anything else that was different about the session that you want to tell me
i know you said that the dressing was something new
the way she played with the the food was totally different then
i mean i don't know if they had the food
i think there was food earlier
but she didn't play with it the same way
um and i guess her attention span was a little bit longer in this one for the toys
like she probably wouldn't have played with any one toy as long as she did in the last visits
she probably would have just moved from toy to toy
so
i thought she was gonna jump to the animals she seemed like she was getting tired of the food kinda but then she went right back for it
i guess with the doll she sort of incorporated them
yeah
yeah
she's does that at home she feeds everything
she even tries to feed the dog
so
that's cute
yeah
yeah it seemed like she was real pretty familiar with that stuff
i just yeah i wonder if she would have known the thing that is cool about these too is we have the scenes and this has little scenes in it so we try to switch them up
yeah
i think sometimes they're too young to know kinda like what goes where
yeah
yep
yeah she yeah i'm not sure why she wasn't interested
but there's a lot out so
and then does she have anything like this at home
not like that
no she has like a little fake hammer but nothing fine motor like this
i mean tool wise
but she has other fine motor toys but um they're like the little stackable you know like the little posts with the stackable rings
that kind of thing
so
yeah
she doesn't really have anything like that either
i guess all of this is kinda new
yeah
it's a lot at one time
yeah
um she seemed to be familiar kinda like what the screw or she figured it out when i was doing it with her earlier kinda how to do it
so i didn't know if she had something like that at home
yeah
but
no that was new too
you said she likes to stack blocks and stuff
oh yeah
yeah we have legos and then we have
she stacks
we don't really have just blocks
but she stacks other things
like sometimes rather impressively
yeah i think like well she was helping me with the blocks but i think she was getting mad doing it on her own
yeah
but i was trying to see if she could do you know one
yeah
i'm sure she probably could have i think she was getting frustrated
yeah
she doesn't normally work with just the square blocks
i know what it is
we have all these different shaped blocks
so she they have triangles and ar you know like little arches and things
and she plays with that for a long time
and she stacks those and those aren't even uniform shape so
maybe that was kind of it was just like something weird
big big chair now
scoop
yeah she's really talking a lot
yeah
you said just like in the last week she learned a lot more words
yeah
i mean it's sort of like a language explosion for the last month and a half
i mean i was a little concerned for a little while until she was like twenty months and then all the sudden it was like
yeah
explosion of words so
i mean she'll put like four words together in a phrase that actually makes sense pretty regularly which i dunno if that's
that's good
that's yeah
usually around two they're doing like two um two words together maybe three
that's good
yeah i heard her saying kinda long sentences like she said grandma's glasses and stuff like that
so she's doing a lot of that
that's good yeah
really talkative
um okay so i guess the last thing i can try to do the last two things and see
okay
see if she'll go for it
and then that'll be it
alright
so thank you so much
yeah
tell me about what you guys played with
ugh he really loved the animals to start with
so um you know we've got a lot of zebra things at home
you have a lot of what at home
zebra puzzles with zebra
it's all the z
everything is zebra
um so we started out playing with the animals
um
and then he pointed out the poof so i wanted i wanted to look if he'd wanted to play baby but he wasn't all that interested in playing in the baby were you
yah
you guys gonna go run on the ramp again
let's go fly off the ramp
no thank you
no thank you
go play with your puzzle
he's like there are way to many toys
i know
oh can you cook timmy
go over there and see the stove
yah so he he loved the animals
and the birds so then we played with the birds
and the flying we've been doing a lot of flying at home
um and then he saw the puzzle animal
does he you mean flying like with animals at home
like animals and planes at home
oh yah he really liked the airplanes
yah and his grandma and grandpa just came to visit and they flew on an airplane and we went to the airport so we've been talking all about that lately
haha airport that's right
and do you think he recognized some of the animals like you said the zebra
yah he definitely recognized the zebra
um
he was calling the seal a whale but
and he recognized the bear right away at the beginning
but some of these other animals are things we don't
like we haven't really seen like i don't know if he's ever seen an otter or really i'm not sure what this is
yah like i don't know but he knows the kangaroo
so he definitely recognized the kangaroo
hold on let me just put his plug in his mouth
sorry this always falls out
does he um have you guys like been to the zoo or something is that how he
um we just we have a bunch of puzzles that have that are letter puzzles with animals on each thing
and then we have a lot of books with animals in it
so he's been to the zoo once but that was last summer
like not this summer but the summer be
or no it was this summer i guess
but he's only been once
but we just have a ton of book and a ton of puzzles with animals in them
does he like to read a lot at home
yah we read books every day
um like definitely every night at before bedtime
and then there's just there's books in his room to play with and there's books downstairs
so a lot of times when he gets up from his nap he'll just get down and get a book
we'll find him reading books in his bed
aw
that's so cute
does he does he know this one i think maybe he just didn't notice it
yah he probably didn't
hey timmy timmy
no books
you know this one
no read you know good night moon
but apparently you're not interested in it right now
but yes he knows that one
yah
yah
did we read that one
cause you do the lady whispering
hush
hi thank you
hold on we got to wipe your nose
yah i got one
thank you
thank you
he didn't seem to interested in food i don't think
no which is weird cause he has
although you know what we do have a big kitchen and food at home and he just hasn't been into it lately
like he went through a phase with it and then hasn't been
hasn't yah he really hasn't been much like of his play cooking or even doing um that lately
did he in the other sessions was he interested in the food before
yah he was um
yah
yah and he was in in some of the last ones he did some stacking and building of like the cans of food that like these guys in some of the last sessions
um
but i he's just kind of not been interested at home either
so hey we're over food right now huh
what does he usually like to play with at home
um he's all about his puzzles lately
and he's all about things like that require a little more concentration
so we've been doing a lot more coloring that he's wanted to do
and a lot of his puzzles
so we've got the big four puzzles
and trains
he's got trains at home
how could i forget the trains
that are his they talk to one another
they did not like they're the talking trains
but um tugging tin yah and they've got buttons
and if they're close to one another like they'll be like hi wilson how are you
ah that's so funny i haven't seen trains like that
and then like the track he puts the track together and they have like a filling station
and all that so when they get close to the filling station it'll be like time to fill up
cause they know like there are sensors that show
that's crazy
i think when i played with trains it like wooden
yah exactly i know i know
yah
and does he have any like dolls like this at all
he does he has um
he has two baby dolls
right before ryan was born we brought out a baby doll to try and get him used to it that
and then we have another one um
and he you know he'll occasionally put the baby down and put the blanket on the baby but
and he likes to dress the baby every now and then
but actually he like to give me the clothes to dress the baby
so he just likes to bring me clothes but he's not all that interested in playing with them
toys
toys you're like i've got a baby brother
say who needs a baby doll
does he have any like
that i don't even know if he noticed the tool set
but like some you know there was like screws and stuff
he seemed to be interested in the one i gave him like the little screw
yah he has um he has a little bench that you can hammer
um and he has a couple of um blocks that have a screw thing
again he was interested in a while ago
but hasn't really been into it lately
like they're still out in our toy room but he
sorry
oh
that would be my ipod in my pocket
i was thinking it was outside
i thought so too okay
i brought it out in case he
yah
uh yah sorry
i can't remember what i was gonna
oh yah so he likes the coloring like he seems to be into that and he was pretty good with you know with even the big pencil
yah yah he's been doing a lot of coloring lately
um and like we have some markers and we have some big fat crayons
but we also have some of the smaller ones too
and he just loves to color
he got his own little like table for christmas
so he's been he likes to sit at the table and like color
santa ho ho ho
what did you ask santa for
bike please
so you get like a little bike with training
yah he got a tricycle
tricycle yah
yep
yep
ding
um was there anything else that like was different from the previous session you think
like besides what he wanted to play with
um he i mean
he just talks so much more now than he did in the last ones
um
and he is much better at like imitating now
like what i what i do
and what we do
i mean he kinda desides what he's interested in playing with and we kinda just go with it
it's kinda what we've doing all along so it's sorta what he did last time too i think
so
is like a little more independent now with doing his own
yah he can he's always been pretty independent
like um he's been able to play by himself
um for a while now
probably since for at least the last year he's been able to for a little bit by himself
he's been a little more clingy to me lately since ryan was born
um of like wanting us to play
but usually once he gets going on his own you can sometimes like sneak off and go do something else real quick if you need to
so um but he's definitely getting like he can do it for longer periods now
like play by himself
does he ever try to like bring toys to the baby or
uh he tried to feed ryan some pizza the other day
oh no
so he like picked it up and had it in his mouth before
oh god
oh no
is like familiar with like like seeing you feed him the bottle and stuff
yah yah um he probably doesn't him get bottles as much from me
um
but um
he likes to get put blankets around him you know blankets and tuck in ryan
and then he likes to give him his his pacifier
like he likes to take it out and then put it in his brothers mouth
butters coming
or the bug is coming
i heard bug but maybe he's saying burgers are coming
burgers i don't know
bu coming
does he like do you think he's familiar with the stove like seeing you in the kitchen and stuff
yah yah cause he he likes to watch us cook and he's been pulling chairs over lately to try and like help
um so he definitely
burger coming
bug is coming
or is it it's not butter
is this what you're looking for a burger
he's like sure
whatever
that's exactly what i meant
i know well he'll say something and he'll just keep saying it until you repeat what it is he's like trying to say
timmy drinking
which most of the time i can figure it out
but every now and then he says something like i don't know what you're saying
well yah with the eel i was like what
i don't know what he was oh he was trying say tooth right
sharp tooth
sharp or something like that but there was something else he was saying about it and i couldn't quite figure it out
but yah he'll just keep saying it until you like say something close to what he's actually trying to say
he's very friendly
yah yah
top on
is he ready to eat
yah he'll play with anybody
he was running up and down the ramp with us
he was having a great time
oh yah
and then after all he was like toys
cause i think he remembered like wait a sec there's toys somewhere
yah
okay
well i i guess we're done
alright
he has no problem
okay
so could you tell me about what you guys played with today
um well he started with the dolls
um which was kind of interesting
um we have one at home but uh it's a small babydoll to get him used to the new baby
and um with the banana with the rolling pin
he picked up a couple of the animals
um i showed him a couple more he had the bear the cat the llama
the panda bear he had for a little bit
um the anteater he picked up
um the peacock he had
uh let's see he played with all of all of the food
so um and put all of the cupcakes in the tin
and then he was playing with the uh the stove
and the juice and uh
oh and then he had this also
and he put them both in and then popped them both out
so yeah he he did the outs
kind of went through
yeah kind of through went through a lot of almost everything i think
he didn't uh deal with the magnets or the books or the clothes
but um but the food and the and the animals
does he have stuff like this at home
um no and that's what kinda makes it interesting
the only thing that we really have at home is uh one doll and then we have books
which he didn't even see so
yeah
i don't if he noticed it there's just so much
does he like to read with you a lot
he does
he see the ki the older boys reading and so he has his books that he likes to read at night
so
but yeah he does
and then you said he has a doll at home what kinds of things does he like to do with the doll
he uh picks the doll up and he'll pat it on it's back
and he'll try to put a pacifier in it's mouth and it's not one that you can do that with
and uh he'll put it in the baby swing that we have and he'll get a blanket and he'll cover the doll up and
he sees me doing that with his younger brother and so he was doing it with his babydoll
so like oh so before before you had the baby he didn't do that stuff but now that he's watching you do it
he we started out with hi uh the babydoll sitting with me so that he would get used to something other than him being with me
and then we moved and then when he kinda saw what i was doing with his baby brother he started doing that too with the little bro with his doll
that's cute
did that do you think that helped him to like
yeah
but i think it helped also that he had older brothers who were holding the baby and you know getting stuff for me and helping me out
and and then he wants to hold the baby
so it's it's actually been wor really good
yeah that's good too like he has everybody kinda so he knows he supposed to kinda take care of the baby
i'm sure a little at first you know it's weird having another kid around that's
smaller than him
yeah
he he goes to the gym though and there's kids that are his age older and smaller so he's used to seeing it
so but yeah having one all the time
but yeah he's he's been adjusting pretty well
oh that's good
you said he goes to a gym does he like to play outside a lot
um he he does
he loves to go on walks
i mean he's so active as it is but yeah he likes to go on walks and uh go there are trails by our house and so we go down and walk around the trails and
yeah
so he's he's more is he more like into outdoors things than this kinda stuff
yeah for the most part he sees his brothers playing on like their d s and stuff and so he likes things that make noise
um he has a couple books that make noise and so he'll just sit there and you know hit the buttons and make noise
and he has his drum and uh other things that make a lot of noise and that's what he likes
he recognized the drums didn't he
yeah
he was like patting them and i was like i wonder if he has one
um so with the food like did he does he eat anything like this at home
yeah
has he seen you guys eat it
yeah everything here pretty much
um we eat corn we have uh he calls every fruit usually apple
um but we have a lot of stuff
we eat the hamburgers we have um we don't have ice so much but he knows what you're supposed to do with it and the cheese he likes
um we have uh
he watches my husband cook and so he was pu going like this with the little jars and things
adding the seasonings
um and then the meat and everything
but yeah he's he's seen pretty much everything
yeah he seemed to kinda know like know what to do and stuff
yeah
does he ever try to help you guys in the kitchen
all the time
all the time
he's tried to help us uh s empty the dishwasher fill the dishwasher um he's he's our big helper
i noticed that he really liked putting things away
away
and i was like oh this is good you know
yeah
that'll be helpful when the little baby you know starts making more messes and getting into things
yeah
yeah he knows where stuff is supposed to go and has a very real idea of how things are supposed to be
so
um and you said he doesn't have any animals like this but do you think he'd maybe recognize any of these
like do you guys have you been to a farm or anything like that
we have
we've we go to farms we've been to the zoo
um he watches uh shows on the television that have different animals on it
we do starfall dot com and it has it's a learning thing
it has it does the alphabet
and um he knows that some of them from that
uh they have like gorillas on it
they're all uh they're not real but so i think he kind of sees the different animals and tigers and things like that
so
so he might have recognized some of these things
yeah
yeah it seemed i dunno was he maybe he most interested in this and then does he have like clothes at home that he tries to dress his doll with
no
or like so maybe he's not really familiar with
yeah
what you do
no and he's well he knows what he does with the clothes
so and he every so often he'll try and get stuff on himself but for the most part he's uh he's a takeroffer
and so but yeah we don't usually take anything off the babydoll or anything like that so
and usually he's asleep when we're changing the baby or washing the baby so he probably wasn't too sure what to do
yeah
with it
but he but maybe if he had seen the book he might have been interested
gott looked at it
maybe for like a couple of seconds you know opened it up maybe flipped a page and then put it back down
so but he usually will sit and read with you like he can go through the whole book with you
it depends
um there's he has a couple of favorite books that he likes
um last night we had pooh blocks
you read and you're supposed to it says like you know pooh can do his abc's can you flip the blocks to make it abc
and and so i'll do it for him and every so often he'll try to flip the blocks but he's more interested in just kinda flipping the pages and
but uh too big
he'll actually sit and he'll watch me flip the pages and read to him
it's about it's a potty training book
and we've had it forever and he really enjoys that book for some reason
i'm not really sure why
maybe like the diapers are familiar to him now with the baby too or something i dunno
it's been going on since before that
he's actually been trying to potty train since he was like fifteen months old
so he just decided one day that was what he wanted to do and so we were eh if you want to
so
that's funny
but yeah that's one of his favorite books
he seemed to be really interested in the book you were reading before
he sat through the whole thing
i thought you know he wasn't gonna want to sit stay sitting but he seemed to really like it
yeah
so i i thought maybe you guys read a lot of books
and a lot of kids know this books so sometimes they're like ah you know they they try to read they knows what's gonna happen
um is there anything that was different from the other sections
um the other play session
i don't think so no he's usaully he usually goes after the food a lot so
that's normal
but and it's i never know if it's he's hungry and i don't see how it could be but it's possible and
we like to pretend to eat them so you know probably he's getting ready for lunch
getting that time
um is there anything else you want
no
any questions or anything
nope
um so we can just try to look at the cards a bit when he get back
i don't know um if he'll do it but i just need to get him to say what it is anyway he call it's just like articulation and like how he says it so
um so i'm just gonna ask you a couple questions about tonight and devon will play with kalin a little bit
okay
you're gonna go play with devon okay
okay so um do you want to start telling me what he was interested in today
what he started playing with first
first he started playing with this uh what what would you call that
it's kind cool
it's not really a puzzle but
yeah it's like a magnetic
type thing
yeah
yeah it was the animal pieces he was drawn to first
and then um he went to the babies for some reason
he doesn't even have any of those at home
and um and then to the food
i kinda had to ask him what that was for him to go over there
i don't think he likes the animals
yeah so with the puzzle type thing um what was he doing with that
um it was more of him playing with the pieces
and when i pulled the fly he liked the water on him
you take the cupcake to devon
do you want some water
alright so um any of so the animals does he play with those at home at all
um a lot of books have animals in 
and he's always pointing out and uh making sounds
uh does he have any favorite animals
not that i know
no
because i'm i'm at home with him during the day so i mostly try to do like letters and colors and his dad reads the books to him at night when he gets home from work
right
and so they do the animals and stuff
yeah
okay
uh um you did the water one um did he like any of the other did you go through any other scenes
um yeah the farm
and then the the water one
okay
did he like one better than the other or were they all pretty
um i think he got more into that one because i was singin the song with the animals
this one he was just like water
yeah
um and any of the animals were any of them do you think any new to him that he may have never seen before
um yeah the when we had the kangaroo
probably this and that ostrich bird
yeah those are pretty not very common
exactly
yeah there are
okay and he played with the babies a little bit you said
what was he doing with them
um oh my earring
oh
it fell
um well he was undressing that one
yeah
but the other one he just held it up to say baby pretty much
but he doesn't have those at home
no
but there's a lot of um
hi
morning it's afternoon
it's evening
um no babies at home but there's babies in the family
okay
stop throwing
go with the bubbles
look bubbles
now you don't want the bubbles
okay and um so he did play with the kitchen a little bit right
what was he doing with that
um puttin things in the bowl stirrin it up
tryin to eat the cupcake
um he was interested by i guess the sound this one the stove was makin the little timer
uh huh
um but that's about it
tryin to eat stuff here and there
yeah
does he play with food at home at all
no
no so that's a new new thing to him
did he have any um favorite foods he was gravitating towards or
no
it was about all equal
yeah and are any of those foods familiar to him
cupcakes pizza corn bananas
yeah
um and any brand new foods he may not have seen before or maybe less familiar with
this thing
it was like a lamb chop or something
yeah i think so
it's too small to be a pork chop right
yeah
yeah
alright so are there any other things he plays with at home that we didn't have here
balls
yeah
his first obsession was balls
yeah
and then cars
cars now but he likes sports
yeah
yeah it always seems funny that boys are always you know like balls and cars and we don't have any of those but
i say he shoots baby threes
we have our couch is like right here he stands here and let's say the hoop is where the camera is and he'll stand and he'll shoot
he'll make it
oh yeah
baby threes
he's gonna be pretty good i bet
i hope so
i think that if we had balls here they would be all over the room
they would
they would be throwing them because they don't really understand not to throw yet
yeah exactly
um and did you notice anything about his play today that was different from what he normally does
i mean i know he played with the babies a little bit but
um
well in this session
yeah
no
he's kind all over the place
he never he doesn't sit and just play with one thing for too long
yeah
and um i guess compared to other play sessions has this been has he been pretty much the same
this one has been better because last time we can i don't think he i don't think he was as mobile
he wasn't able to well last time i was giving him stuff like here kalin look at this
he was able to get up and see what he wanted to do and didn't want to do
right
hey bud how ya doing
say good shaun
alright um anything else you noticed today that you wanna bring up or any concerns
um no
alright well he did a great job today i mean it's late he didn't have a nap today but um he did a really great job today
he stuck on the tasks after going on and on
we got through everything which we don't always do so that's good
right
so i have two consent forms i'm gonna have you sign
alright
um and i'll explain them a little bit
watch your foot
i'm going to give you an envelope to send this other form
um allison if you just wanna play with kennedy a little bit i'm just gonna inter do a quick interview with you
okay
um
like away from
um right here is fine
oh okay
i know the moose
so do you just wanna tell me what she started playing with today
um when we first sat down i think she kinda went towards
okay play with allison
give her some ice
she loves ice i bet
she started playing with the um animals
and trying to identify some of them when i asked her
um
does she know a lot of them or
she knew she knew some
she knew she started at these in the store for a long time
okay
and then she she thought this was a horse
um
she thought something was a dog that was a bird
oh
okay mommy can't eat all this corn i'm just so full
i'm so full you have to share with other people
that's a rolling pin
and then so she kinda lost interest in that and went to this cooking thing
and we have these at home so
oh you do
yeah
the food and everything
so shh i think maybe familiarity she just gravitated to it
yeah
but she didn't wanna really go away from that
i tried to br draw her interest in the dolls
and she beat it with a c spoon
she didn't have any interest today
sometimes she likes that but today she just didn't show a lot of interest in it
um but she was interested in making her soup
yeah
so that's what she's been doing
and feeding us ice
right
um and so with the animals you said she knew some of them
she knew some of them
what did let me see what she she knew
she only looked at these two
i'm trying to remember what she called a dog
oh i think she might have called this a dog
right
and she i could tell she had never seen this so she was staring at it for a long time
yeah
um she didn't have much interest in this
yeah
she knew that was a bird
and she called something a duck that wasn't a duck
oh
she does know them though
just you know maybe they look weird they're little small plastic toys but she does know a lot of her animals
she watches a lot of those things on tv at home
oh does she
does she have any favorite animals
um dog
it's a good one
she likes dogs
um then i showed her this apart
she likes to put things together
i know like maybe not so much here but at home that's always what she's doing
yeah
so i put this together and she knew right away what to do with it so
yeah she like turned this over and started screwing
so clever
um so with the food does she have similar foods at home
yeah
yeah we have a lot of these same things
are there any any of her favorites that she really goes towards
i don't know if she knew what this was but she seemed interested in it maybe it's hairy looking i dunno
but she k that's really the one she played with that and the ice cones
oh really
so i mean we do have the ice cones and pizza and she didn't really do much with that
you didn't break it
um were any of the foods were they unfamiliar to her she would would she may not seen any of them before
yeah i dunno if she knew what that was mayb
i dunno
doesn't really look like cake but
looks like a yummy cupcake huh
and a glob peanut i think
yeah these this was kinda she was staring like that like what and i was too so i don't know what that is
maybe oatmeal
it's actually it's tuna fish
i know
every single every single parent sees it and its like is it throw up
you know that's what they think it is
i i mean i have to l on the bottom it says that it's tuna fish that's the only way i found out
oh that's funny
yeah
oh that's funny
it's gross
um anything else that any other foods that she saw that
she didn't ask me what anything was
um a fish
um and are any of the foods are they ones that she actually eats so she may have recognized them that way
she likes string beans
yeah
she um she keeps calling everything apple and i don't know why that what that's about today
she knows that apples are red and they aren't
she called this an apple
oh yeah
um and she called something a banana that clearly wasn't a banana
that red pepper
oh okay
same shape
yeah
um was there anything else that she played with
no not really
yeah
does she play with dolls at home
she does
yeah
she does and she dresses them up and she dresses up a lot in dr play dress up clothes
she did play with this
she put it on the oven for a while
oh yeah
um are the dolls similar to what we have or are they
this one looks like her dora doll
okay
a little bit
uhoh you gotta put the pants on
here's some green or blue pants for the doctor
alrighty
and um do they have different does she have like different dress up
like some of the i know we have different uh different characters kinda like that
does she have any of those
with her with the barbies she does
with her bigger dolls whatever they came in
yeah
she just takes that off and puts it back on and mixes up and
yeah
um but no not themed
doctor uniforms or what not
right
um and are there any other things does she usually play with at home that we don't have
toys that you
yeah any toys that you usually play with
she likes electronics that's why she keeps kinda gravitating to that when she sees those instead of
i mean that's the era they're in
oh yeah
so she has a lot of electronic type games where it sings to her and stuff like that
um yeah quack quack
that's a geese
his shirts under her cheerleading
um and anything else you noticed during the play that you thought was interesting or different from what she usually does
no we have a playroom in our house and she's just goes crazy in there she loves it
yeah
but she's usually really messy in there but she's really neat anyway
like she likes to organize things by color and when she messes something up she usually puts it away
she's not like that at home in the playroom but she's like that everything else she does
yeah
and um i didn't notice her trying to do that so much right now so that was a little different
okay
alright
alright
you wanna keep getting her dressed
sure or
all set
ask you a few questions
um
so do you wanna just tell me what she started playing with today
she started with this
landscape
whatever you wanna call it
okay
um
um what was she what was she doing with it
she was lining up
different uh
pieces on the bottom
on the ground for her
and has she ever played with anything like that before
no
no
um
were any of the pieces were they thing's she's familiar with
um
some of the animals
yeah the elephant
i don't know if she knows a barn
um
so
i guess
you know those were novel
yeah
okay
um and then
i heard
were you practicing some animal sounds with her a little bit
yes
does she know most of those
a few of them yeah
she learned them through
i probably shouldn't say the word wiggles
so other songs so
they do the rooster cock a
and they do a cow and a horse
so
okay
right
you gonna give it to sean
we're all gonna
we're sharing
okay
um and was she very interested in that or did it
i mean she was
it looked like she was interested in the beginning
okay
yeah
so what else was she
we played with the zippers
and the little boxes a little bit
i mean most of the time we did food
okay
the grocery
the food
yeah that's a popular area
that's a fun one yeah
um so with the with these toys did she
did she like the animals at all
or was it mostly just
she no i mean she didn't stay with it long
we put the tree up
we did the ostrich
and then
the zippers a couple times
does she play with animals at all at home
a little
a little bit
not too many
are they similar to the ones here or are they
uh no
i'm trying to think a way what kind of animals we have
probably not
probably more like stuffed animals
okay
and then with the food
what was she
what was she doing
she
she was eating lots of desserts
and sharing with mommy
right
right
that and the tools
i guess we forgot the screwdriver
and screw
but um
just playing with the food
and we do have
she has um a couple food sets at home
um so we do play with that at home
so
are they similar foods that she has at home
um
no
it's no
i mean there's some stuff that's
there's hotdogs which she didn't get to
um but
texture size wise it's similar
yeah
were any of the foods novel to her
or anything new that she'd never seen before
um no
no
i don't think so
okay
no she's actually a very daring young eat
eater
that's good
yeah
does she have any favorite foods
uh yeah do you have favorite foods
it won't
put it in
um
typical
chicken nuggets
pizza
yeah
french
yeah
cereal
right
but she she'll eat
pretty much anything we we put on the plates
so
okay
yeah
um and did she play with anything else
the tools
well the screwdriver and the nuts
uh
a little bit to the doll
i kind of i think prompted her over there
yeah
does she have dolls at home
she has a couple
she does
she does have
you have two
shoe
oh you found one shoe
um
she has two dollies that she really plays with
one the goes in a grocery cart
and some that goes in a stroller right
oh you want that shoe that matches that one
i don't know if that one
oh
there's a match
okay
you wanna go put it on the dollie
um
but she
i guess we're
she plays with a lot of cars and trains
okay
so does she do anything like dressing up dolls like that at home
um
not a lot of dressing up
a lot of care
like the bottle
or she and her brothers will put it
there's grocery cart we have at home
so they put the dolls in the grocery cart
like the big ones and push them around
yeah 
she follows her big brothers a lot
so it's not a lot of typical girl or baby play
um
she's fine with mommy
yeah
yeah
what
she's only got shoes on
i know
she i think she needs some more clothes
i think she likes how all this direct attention
i don't think she's used to having undivided play attention
she is just cracking me up
she does like to take attention
don't ya
look i'm sitting her playing and going you know
i really should sit and play more directly with her
but it just doesn't happen as much at home
wanna put a shirt on
no shirt no shoes no service
yeah
uh did you notice anything else about her play today that was
um did you notice anything else today that was um
maybe something new she played with
um
nothing too new
like i said this
but it kinda reminded me of like a puzzleish
um
no
she really played pretty similar items
yeah
um is there
i know you mentioned cars and stuff at home that she plays with
is there anything else that she plays with at home
that we didn't have
um
we do a lot of the cars
the trains
she reads
they read a lot
plays with books a lot
what else do you normally play with
what
um
electronics
little you know
computerish type similar games
or things that look like computers
or ipods
right
right
you like to talk on the phone a lot
don't you
do you like to call people on the phone
you know that's
that's fine
um
so
what else do you play with
we've been doing puzzles lately
that's been a new one
yeah
oh
puzzles
do you like puzzles
i'm the dolly dress right now
yeah
yeah
she likes to write a lot
okay
she will sit at the table
or on the floor
and anytime i start writing something
or her dad
she goes and gets
we get paper and she just scribbles forever
that's great
yeah
right
do you like to draw
and write
yeah
am i in your way
i'm sorry
can i get some
i'm on a mission
cheerleader
she's going from a
doctor
doctor to a cheerleader
well rounded
well rounded part time job
alright well i think that's everything
um
so i have just two consent forms to give you
okay
um and i can explain them a little bit
since we're at the end of the longitudinal study
let me get you
a clipboard
did you get a chance to finish filling these out
i did
you did
yeah
okay
good job with that
good luck
there it goes
does that fit her
okay so
we'd have to try a different outfit samantha
crazy
here why don't you try these
oh got it
oh
um okay so there are two consent forms
okay
now the first one is the final one
and then we have an additional one on top of that
um so final
since we're at the end of the longitudinal study
um this just explains a little bit more what we were looking at
so it explains that we've recorded samantha's speech
samples from seven months until now
two years
um
and we also have recorded your speech as well
um in addition to that
and um basically what this is explaining is with your permission
we'll go back and analyze the recordings of your speech
um things we're looking at
are things like your speaking rate
um
varieties of words you use
how carefully you might pronounce new words
um and really comparing it when you're talking with samantha
and when you're talking with an adult
um
and just seeing the differences in um
my lap
thank you
you know
how you're speaking to her to encourage her
to start using language
learn the model
okay
ice
um so this one just needs initials and date here
and here on a signature
and then
i'll explain the additional one quickly
um so this one is
uh like as i explained it's an additional
not part of our study necessarily
okay
um but what it's explaining is that researcher's have been putting
together an international database of child and parent speech
um and language
um
so what this is asking is if we can use um audio recordings
from these sessions
and use it in that database
so um this one
i just you just
need to check whichever of the three choices
um the first one is not allowing our
you know the data to be uploaded
um meaning it would just be available to us here for this study
um the second one is anonymous transcripts and test score data
okay
so that would be we just listen to it
do a written transcription
upload that data
um
and then the third is a long anonymous audio recordings
the real benefit of that is when we're listening for something
we're capturing what we hear but
someone else may want something completely different
that we're not looking at
okay
so um
with both of these options anything identifying would be removed
you said her name
uh her siblings names
anything like that would be removed
so is it one choice or is it both
um it's one of those
so the most accessible would be this one
right
okay that's fine
that's fine
so um just check any of those three and sign your name
sure
it's too small for me
back to you
thank you
and we can let her pick out a prize
or do you wanna pick out her prize
she can pick out a prize
we probably just have a bunch of two year prizes out here
we don't keep our normal box in here
right
it's in the other room
let's see
the doll foot
she's wearin a backpack
and nothin else
so the interview afterwards were more to look at how
we speak to adults than actually the play
or can you not answer that yet
um
well no it was i mean it was looking at the play
but it's also yeah um yeah how you're using those words
speaking to adults
um
i was curious about the first two
i'm like why are
you know
the questions kinda seemed a little
i'm like okay
do you wanna pick a toy
let's see i got a couple
oh
look at those
which one do you want samantha
you get to pick one
which one do you want
why don't ya pick one
what one do you wanna take home
do you wanna book
or a truck
a truck
the playdoh might be okay
which one
you found one
oh she saw something
what'd you see
oh
you got sesame street books
did you see elmo
i though i heard elmo
elmo
do we have a winner
i think we're good
thank you
you got elmo we're all good now
yeah
what did you find
oh elmo books
two books
wow
what's that
they must've restocked the box
yeah we got a big shipment in three weeks ago
what'd ya get
wow
who's that
do you know who that is
cookie monster
why is the cookie monster holding grapes
i don't know
the cookie monster doesn't eat grapes
there's shapes
that's a triangle
but there better be a circle in there somewhere
what honey
what's that shape
is that into a triangle
do you want to open it
yeah
there you go
here go
here
here
which one do you wanna
which one do you want
oh
here's your recycling bin
i like your
i love those
i was reading that
that's kind of a great idea though
yeah
to help people recycle and now just throw
we just got
keep playing and then we'll see what we want to do
okay
so do you want to tell me what he played with
the food
always the food
he has played with the food everytime we've been in here
does he play with the food at home at all
its funny we don't have that much food at home
and because of this i keep joking that we need to get some
so we got some at christmas but he's not that into it at home
i mean its you know he'll play with it
but not like here
right
so was some of the food here different from previous ones
yeah it seemed like you had more and different stuff this time
was there anything he was
the cupcakes i think he was pretty excited about because
and he actually loves muffins and cupcakes and pizza
pizza you've had before and he's obsessed with every time
and you used to have spaghetti that he was obsessed with because that's another
he's an extremely picky eater so its kind of ironic that he's this obsessed with the food
extremely picky eater
so i'm like most of these foods you don't actually eat
does has he seen any of the foods in real life before
yeah he loves these but he can't eat them very much because they're not good for him
these not for a while because of the season
we give him tuna but he rejects everything
does he know the names of those foods
he knows this
he said this
muffin
pizza
peas
he knows peas
hey buddy
he knows cheese but he usually eats it in stick form
so i don't he wouldn't recognize it in these little floppy slices
do you see the corn buddy
do you see the corn
corn
that was a good burp there
lets put this lets put everything away
you want to help me put it all away
okay lets put it away
um
was there any other food that he was interested in or maybe even not interested in
well i don't know if he picked up on my these gross me out
the soft ones
so
he was thinking about making faces probably like i was
i don't know
i mean this didn't interest him because he doesn't really eat big chunks of meat so he probably just doesn't even recognize that
its not stuck so much as mommy is wearing a microphone
here
there we go
unstuck
better
want to put those in the basket
i'm wearing that
that's my decoration
you're a little pissant
we're almost done okay
mommy's going to wear that
can you put that in the basket for me
can you put that in the basket
and then did you try to get him to play with anything else besides the foods
not really because i know that he only wants the food
yeah
you know if he showed interest a little bit i'm happy to involve him in other stuff
but i know from experience he's obsessed with the food so i'm like go for it
yeah
so at the end he was playing with he was playing with something but i can't remember
the animals
he was playing with the doll but then kind of the animals
this is like at home
he's not super into books
he's got a few at home that he likes
okay
and we'll read him some for sure
but he's not like my daughter loved reading and he's like alright it's one activity that you can make me do sometimes
yeah
hi baby
were there any animals that he played with a lot
well he has dinosaurs that look like this
but he doesn't have animals
put away
yeah you're going to put them right in there
um
i pointed out the panda bear because he knows panda bears
he was looking for an elephant which i couldn't find
he likes elephants a lot
i didn't find one huh buddy
any other animals
he seemed interested in this guy
but i didn't
do you know what that is
what is that
a penguin
you do know
how do you know penguins
do you know penguins from curious george
i don't know how you know penguins
i know its my pin huh
its like my little decoration
you're going to make an interesting page for them to listen to
can you put the penguins in here
say bye penguin
you want to put this food away too
penguin goes in here
why do you care
why do you care
its okay
lets put the food away
can you get the pizza
can you put it in the basket for me
where's the pizza
pizza's got to go in the basket
can you get it
calm down
okay mommy can pick it up
let go please
we can go know but we have to clean up first
help me clean up
yeah
food away
food away
was there anything else that you really saw
that was interesting to him
no
aside from the food
okay
food food and more food
alright
so do you think it would probably be better to come back another time
i think yeah
okay
this is by far the longest he's ever sat for anybody so well done
well yeah its tough sometimes
we're asking them to do a lot sometimes
he's saying goodbye to you
would it be easier for me to email you or just set it up now
we can try now i've got my calendar
it helps that he also thinks your name is john because he has a lot of johns in his life
yeah
well that's alright
here we go
we're going to put it away
is there any day that's better for you
do you know
well how much longer will it be
about an hour
do you think
it should be about an hour
i assume the sooner the better
yeah
put the shoe in here
here we go
alright nice job
you found a chair
oh there's no reception here
yeah
i know its very inconvenient
tomorrow won't work

thank you
bye
we're going to get your jacket okay
is it hanging up in the
yeah
okay
excuse me we're going to put the chair back
thank you
do a quick interview with you
sure
um
she can just keep playing
um
and i think i have most of your forms filled out
i might need to still
okay that's fine you can just leave that there for now is fine
um
do you wanna just tell me a little bit what she started playing with today
um i think she was very interested in the animals until she saw the kitchen
and then she went for the kitchen because the kitchen's her favorite
yeah
um did she do much with the animals at all
no
oh
i think she picked out the fox which i'm not sure where it went and it's she likes swiper from dora
oh okay
and that's why she picked out the fox right away
yeah
um
okay so she went over to the food and that was
where we stayed
yeah um so you said that's her favorite
yes she likes that a lot
um does she have food at home
is that
she does
we have a kitchen and toy food
and at her childcare too she has two older girls there and they're both very into babies and cooking and all that stuff so i think that's why
she's interested in that too
um does she have similar food
do they have similar to what is here
we don't have this
um but i'd say a lot of them are probably actually i'd say we don't like have like lambchops or anything either
but i mean we have a lot of variety so we got like the mega pack
oh yeah
so she probably has seen most of these things
does she have anything she really gravitated toward
anything she
i'm tryin to think
i don't the ice cream i guess
i don't think that's ice cream
i think that's mashed potatoes
yeah you don't like mashed potatoes
you're a weird kid
i like mashed
this is the weirdest food ever
i know i know
it's kinda gross
you think that's ice cream
i don't even know what that is
that that causes a lot of questions
it's actually tuna fish
but
oh alright
well that's not that weird
yeah i know
oh it says it on the bottom
yeah
um so any of the food um were any of the things new to her
anything she might not have seen before
uh definitely not this
whatever this is
i didn't even know what that was
um i actually don't think sushi is new to her
um but she's not that familiar with it
yeah
we read a book about sushi randomly
um and we do eat sushi just not that often
i'm trying to think if there's any other food that i saw
i guess we didn't get to the one's that she wouldn't have known
gentle baby
um yeah i don't see anything that she wouldn't have known necessarily
other than the turnips
right
and then she thought this was ice cream so
um and any of these foods that's she actually eats in real life that she maybe she recognized
ice cream
we're really healthy in our house
yeah
you can tell
um yeah i mean she would probably know
thank you
she's eaten kiwi clearly
oh yeah
um hamburgers
cheese
she knows peanut butter she's eaten
mushrooms
she'll eat it just like this
oh wow
um so might not recognize that
peas
pro not lambchops
right
oh that would have been a food she probably doesn't know
oh yeah
she would know it was meat probably but that's about it
but yeah she knows bananas
the vegetables and the fruits
yeah
um
i don't think she would know tuna slash throw up
was she doing anything with the food besides you know just kind of looking at it
pretending to eat it
yeah
really trying to eat it
sticking it down the baby's shirt
oh right yeah
not sure what that was about
i heard that a little bit
um trying to feed me
i think that's about it
does she do any um at home or at daycare does she do any cooking
anything like that
like real cooking or
er no just pretend cooking
pretend cooking yeah
she does cook things
yeah
and she mix things together
oh yeah
um so and then she played with the the dolls a little bit right
little bit yeah
um does she play with those at home at all you said
claire don't don't chew on that honey
we do wipe down after every one but
you won't be able to if she really eats it right
you right yeah
um sorry what did you ask me
um
oh you did you say she plays with dolls at home er
yes she has several babydolls at home
okay
and um are they similar to these or are they different
one is
one's like this
one is this
actually two are like this
they look similar to these yeah
and what sorts of things does she usually do with the dolls
she likes to put it in their stroller and push them around the house or to the park
go outside
um she likes to put them in the chair to feed them
yeah
gotta feed them
um she likes me to wrap them in a blanket so she can finish putting them to sleep
thank you this looks delicious
nice dessert spread
wow look at you
wow
um yeah put to sleep
comfort them
yeah
does she do any dressing up at all
she has to herself so she'll take the clothes off
but then she'll want me to like put the clothes on for her she doesn't want to do that
she'll get frustrated
does she play with any that are in any kind of outfits or from
there's two spoons
yeah i think all of hers have clothing
okay
thank you
did she did she play with anything else today
i don't think so
nope
um what sorts of things other than you know the food and the baby does she usually play with at home
she has um little people
like the house that you guys have
yeah
um and it has like a car and an airplane and a farm
and pretty much everything they make for little people
um but so she'll make the animals like go to sleep
or put the people to bed
she likes that which we play a lot um but she'll just drive like race cars and um and she she actually i would say her favorite still her favorite way to play is physical play
oh yeah
like we have a tent at home
she loves to just like run in the tent and in and out around the backyard
she loves to be outside
garage
she likes to go to the park
swing
slide
oh careful
careful baby
um tickling
like chasing
yeah
i'd say that's her favorite way to play
um and she loves books
yeah
she could read books all day
um but with toys i'm trying to think
she's not so into puzzles
no
she'll complete like a wooden puzzle
yeah
um but interlocking she's not really interested even in having me help her
okay
we have a big one and she's not that into it um
it's a pepper
it's a hot pepper
oh hot
chili pepper
ouch
um i'm trying to think what else she plays
she has like one of those
top computers
oh yeah
where you push the buttons
she plays that
and like toy phone
another pepper
there was another pepper honey
where did it go
some hot dog
i think there was a green one somewhere
yeah i think there was a green one
where did it go
are you sitting on it
yeah
why don't you stand up then and see if it's under your bumbum bum
oh it's under the baby
oh it's under the baby's bumbum bum
there they are
two hot peppers
and so what she played with today is it similar to what she's done in other play sessions
or i know she's younger
i think all the sessions she wanted the toy food
yeah
and the babies
i think all of them she did
yeah
i'm trying to think
i think all of them
how many play sessions are there
two other ones
there are let's see so they they start at seven months
i'm only remembering two
they start at seven months and then
she's seven months ten months
did they do a play session with the first one though
i don't remember
did we do one with that
i don't remember if they did it with the first one
i remember twice and i think both times she played with the
yeah
toy food or the baby doll
i'm pretty sure
but not the whole time
yeah
there are two
nice job
yeah i'm pretty sure these play sessions could just be the food and every kid would be fine
it's too hot
yeah i feel like a lot of
yeah
um alright was there anything else you
oops
you noticed during the play that that was interesting something different
um i would say just in general she typically does talk more than that
i though she was quieter than usual
yeah
like at home she'll talk incessantly
yeah
like never ending strain of words
so she's a little quieter
yeah i'd say a little bit
and i guess w was she la i guess the last play session did she come in for an eighteen month visit or
y
okay
was she talking much then
yeah
yeah
oh now you're going to play with the other ones
do you think she's more talkative in that visit or
no
no
just
no
i think she's been quieter than she typically is every visit
oh
i think just being a new place she's a little shy
yeah
yeah
shyer than i expected actually
i think it's a lobster
look at that
it's a big lobster
it's from the ocean
alright
and oh there was one thing i didn't um on the
mullen fine motor does she usually turn pages in the book
does she just turn one at a time or
oh yeah
she can do one at a time
um i mean she doesn't always do one at a time but she
yeah
take my eye out
it's an eel
it goes in the water
it swims
swims in the water
called an eel
with sharp teeth
oh no look at you
so now um i can give you since we're we're all finished so um we have two consent forms to go over
okay
um
i can
give to you
he's squawking
squawk
squawk
is that what the parrot says
yeah
ouch
did he bite you
no mouth
maggie come here please
is she done probably
probably yeah
okay
should we put away the toys
put a
actually um i was just gonna ask you a few questions real quick
oh sure
that's fine
um
maggie
come on get outta there
um do you wanna tell me what she started playing with today or what she was interested in
uh starting playing with the dolls
and then doing some pretend play with the food
um she spent a lot of time with that that's what she really is into right now
she's kinda interested in the animals for a minute
and then back to the pretend play with the kitchen stuff
right
and then just putting things in her mouth and hiding
right
um
out of your mouth please
yeah about
the cracker can do in your mouth
that's good
that's much better
yeah that do you want me to hold that one
i meant the screwdriver yeah i'll hold that thank you
um
okay so um just
just in terms of more specific things so with the food what was she was there any food that went she went towards if she like
the cookies the cupcakes um
those were the the porkchop she liked the porkchop
those we the items she pretty much honed in on
the corn
we have this corn so that was familiar to her
oh yeah
um were there any foods that were new to her she
um most of them actually
i mean as far as like what the food is she's never seen suh real sushi before
she sorta looked at that um the kiwi she thought was a little bit interesting
she's
had kiwi but probably hasn't seen it like that
yeah
um as far as just she's had mashed potatoes before but she's never seen a toy that looks like that
or whatever the gelatinous goon next to that is
that one
yeah
yeah
it's tuna fish
o okay
yeah
of course
i mean everyone
it does
yeah
um
it's spam
i was thinking of just taking it out
oh well you know the green beans are a little funky too you know they're good conversation
um
yeah so those were the things that she was drawn to
yeah um any of the animals was she
the farm animals cause she she knows those pretty well
um the horse the cow the sheep
um she sort looked at the giraffe we've got a lot of giraffe toys at home but she was more interested in the fact that its head came off
it happens
it does
yeah um did she play with the baby at all
yeah she started off playing with the baby
okay
um i was actually kinda surprised she didn't come over here cause when i was telling her the baby needed the diaper change cause she really likes to pretend to change
yeah
diapers right now she is potty training right now so
it's an area of interest to her
um so yeah she played with that she's she's been working really hard on learning to put her own shoes off and on
so she tried for a while to put the baby's shoe on and it was it's a for a different doll so it wouldn't go on
but she was trying she was making good effort with it
yeah
and was there anything else she played with
that was pretty much it
that's about
uh uh yeah
um is there anything else that she usually plays with at home that isn't here
uh she plays with little people a lot
um the little fisher price sesame people
um uh we've got like hippity hop balls
like like i told you earlier she's really into the gross motor
right
kinds of things
so she and her sister will seesaw and swing
and fly and we've got a little slide that's in our playroom and that's where they really like to spend a lot of their time and driving the car and
and that that sorta stuff
yeah
those are her favorite activities
but she does like the stuffed animals and the dolls and um and doing pretend play with those
yeah
um
yeah and she's very much right this week into play doh
oh is she
and squishing play doh around
yeah
very funny
do you find it everywhere
you do
it's true
yeah
anything else you noticed that was um
that she may
done play today that was different from which from which she normally does anything
no no i i pretty well knew what as you were spreading things out which she would show some interest in and which should
yeah
she would just avoid
yeah
she liked doing the cooking and pretending to put things in the pot and stir that
yeah
she likes to hang out in the kitchen and watch everything that goes on there
yeah and that is seems two years old they love the food stuff
well they're at that age where they're starting to want to be a little independent
and that's one of the first areas of the house where they can be you know you get a bowl and a spoon and you're making pretend soup
yeah yeah
so there are lots of things around the house that they can't do yet but that
is one place that they can start doing stuff
yeah yeah
sure
so can you tell me about what you guys played with
mostly with the food
did she um not seem interested in the other stuff at all or
i think there just wasn't enough time
yeah
did you i think she played with a few animals right
yeah yeah
but that wasn't as exciting
and is that kinda similar to other play sessions or
um
other play sessions here
yeah
um
more with the food
yeah i think the last time we were here she played with the baby
um a fair amount so
but yeah
it's not
does she have anything like this at home
she has food
and babies
yeah
and she has some animals too but she's not as interested in those
yeah i think well also this time they're a little bit different
like usually they were like soft ones
yeah no she has things like this at home
oh okay
she's not as interested in that
yeah
what are you lookin for honey
the peanut and jelly
it's right here
oh there it is
and at home you said she has like babies
she has babies
um she has
no they're not like that
um but she's got a bunch of different kinds
she doesn't have any like that but
she has stuffed animals
and she has soft babies and she has babies that can go in the tub
and what does she usually like to do with the babies
does she just like
um care for them
change their diaper
put them um
we have a two month old at home
so there's a lot of baby equipment
so she puts them in the swing and she puts them in the high chair and she puts in the car seat
and backs the diaper bag and
so she's like mimicking what she sees you do
yes
yes
the most recent interest is uh putting the baby in a carrier and carrying the baby around on her chest
is it a little baby brother or
yes yes
aw
that's exciting
yes
does she try to play with her brother
yes yes
yeah she does
i see
and she's and then that's her only sibling
yes yeah
um so at home like with the food was it was it kinda similar to the way she plays here with similar
yes she feeds people and cooks
she has a a kitchen um and so she cooks
and she often goes grocery shopping and she'll put things in a bag and pay for them and that sort of thing
yeah
does she ever try to help you in the kitchen too or
yes yes
she cooks with us a fair amount
do you think she recognizes any of these foods or does she ever eat them
um oh yeah
um the cupcakes the cheese the ice cream
she didn't recognize the kiwi but she eats a fair amount of that
the green beans she recognized
the donut
the peanut
um
yeah some of these foods are a little different too than the other ones and they're more life like
yes it's a little bit that's a little bit realistic
gross
and has she ever seen any animals like this in real life
um yeah we've been to the zoo and to the farm
um
she's seen a sheep a pig
um
a z oh maybe she hasn't seen a zebra
um
she's seen a turkey though she didn't recognize that
well she was close
i think she said chicken
she said chicken
yeah yeah
um she's seen an emu actually
oh
um
and a peacock
all in like at the zoo or something you said
um at the uh at a couple different farms
the pumpkin patch was where we saw the emu
and the and we've seen sheep and pigs
and then at the farm we've seen a peacock and turkeys
cool
and you were saying before she likes to read a lot
yes
with you
yes
we had this one
this is a popular one
yes yes
she knows that one
what book is that moll
oh you're too busy dressing the baby
gettin the socks on
does she usually try to read to you or is she just kinda
um well she doesn't read
if if we're sitting there she wants us to read
but she does read to herself a fair amount
and you said that book earlier you you had read
you need to put her socks on first
i know we just took the socks off
before you put the shoes on
i know
um the one you guys were reading earlier you said you read that before
uh we got it at the library
she had about as much interest in it from getting it from the library as she had in it here
which is to say zero
yeah
what does she usually like to read
um her curr
she has a she likes to read a variety of things
good night moon is a is one that she likes
um she has a mother goose word book that she likes
um
biscuit's valentine's day
biscuit um
what is it
happy easter biscuit
um
the going to bed book but not the hippopotamus
what are other books we read molly
i love you through and through
what else
anything karen cats
although they're not as popular anymore
they're too simple i think for her
but she has they have been favorites at different times
um
the potty book
um she likes
does she ever try to read to her brother now or
no not yet
he's too little i think
um
that's pretty exciting to have him around
yes
was it hard for her to get used to him at first
she actually adjusted very quickly very nicely
um which was good
i'm sure she's a good big sister
she is
you're a good big sister to tom tom aren't you molly
you have a baby brother
yeah
oh
where is tom tom
right now
he's at grammy and poppy's house
oh
alright
is there anything else that you wanted to tell me
anything seem different or
no
she seems to be pretty independent
yes she's pretty independent
yeah
you put both socks on
i don't think we have any other socks for this baby
oh bummer
i know
they have to share socks
she's pretty articulate
she's pretty verbal
in the last one the eighteen month was she was she a little bit like was she startin to talk more then or was she kind of
she was starting to talk more then
i was actually i was just looking at her baby book and at fourteen months she had about three words and at eighteen she was talking in three word sentences so
she had a bit of a burst
and now it's not unusual for her to rattle off eight or ten words at a time
yeah
yeah
alright well i think the last thing we need to do is just try to finish up
try and finish up those pictures yeah
and then we're done
okay
um okay
we have a few more pictures to look at
we might actually get farther with the pictures if we're allowed to play while we
i was thinkin that too
let's see
do you want this back
um sure yeah i can take that
oh thank you
kind like i said earlier
once he gets focused on one things it's hard to get him to
go to somewhere else
but he did a lot more pretend play today
than what he normally does
like with the eating uh pretending to eat the food
and things
he did a lot more of that than he normally does
like at home normally or
at home normally
does he have u m food like this at home
no
no
what about like does he have any animals
he has like a little play kitchen
and it has like three little things and so yeah
so like it has like a little pot and a little spoon
so he pretends
he eats the soup
but that's it
we don't have a bunch of food items like this
like is it like a stove you mean or just
no it's a
it's a fisher play
laugh and learn
kitchen
and it's like a refrigerator that opens
and on one side of it it's like a little stove and a sink
and has all different buttons and things that you push
and makes sounds and talks to you
and sings and all that kind of stuff
so
i think i've seen those before
or something like that
we have a lot of those
fisher price laugh and learn series
we have a lot of those
is that i'm not familiar with those
are they just like they they like name things for you
yeah it's like interactive
in that you know they there's like a light switch
and you hit the button
on off on off
and they hit the water faucet
and it makes the sound of water coming out
and um
like the refrigerator you open it
open close
like it helps to teach them
words and language
and recognize
shapes
and food items
and
basic concepts like that
so they there's
a whole bunch of them
we have a lot of them
there's a vacuum
there's a kitchen
there's a work bench
there's a laptop
there's like all kinds of stuff
so it's
all very
he likes things that he can he's very textile
he likes to touch
and play with things as opposed to
i was really surprised he did a lot of the pretend stuff
that's newer
um
yeah he likes to
like he with the screwdriver
he likes to manipulate things with his hands
so he's a more hands on player as opposed to pretend
so that was interesting today
yeah
does he have like tools like this
you said like a work bench
yeah he has a little work bench
my husband's in construction
so he helps daddy with little projects in the garage
and things like that so
um
he's very hands on
he plays with his cars and trucks and trains
like takes them across the entire room on the floor
and like
he always has something in his hands
so
yeah he loved those cars when i
yeah yeah
i was like oh
we're going to have a hard time putting those away
yeah
and it's funny because of course it's like a memory thing
and they always remember the car
yup
they always remember the fall so it's like
yeah
i don't know it's a little skewed probably
yeah
especially for little boys
yeah exactly
um
so yeah
does he have any animals like this at home
no
we don't have anything like that
um
like the closest things we would have to like animals would be
like in his books like we talked about
in his books
or like maybe
we have a handful of stuffed animals
but they're mostly all teddy bears
like we have like a horse and a giraffe
but very very few of those
yeah we don't have anything like this
he plays a lot of cars and trucks
that's what he likes
that's what works
we don't have any dolls
at all
oh
um so yeah
everytime we've been and they've had dolls
he's showed no interest
because he doesn't have dolls
he doesn't play with dolls
so it'll be interesting to see now that we have a little girl
we'll have dolls in the house i'm sure
to see if he plays with his little sister's dolls
that'll be interesting to see
so
he probably will
yeah
i know my brother loved playing with my toys
yeah
and i would take his like g i
yeah
um do you think he recognized would have recognized
any of these animals
yes
i think had we come over and played with them
had i been able to take him away from the kitchen
then he yeah he would've recognized um
some of them
maybe not all of them
but some of them
he does more animal sounds
than naming the animals
that's a lobster
they're delicious
has he ever been to a zoo or anything like that
or a farm
he has been to
a farm
but we have no taken him to a zoo yet
we're probably going to do that next month actually
um
but he's been to kinderfarm park
which is near us
um
and they have
it's a farm animals is what they have there
so he's seen farm animals
and then mostly again just through books or movies
we have the baby einstein
d v
and i don't play them very often at all
but
um there's a couple he really likes with like neighborhood animals
or it has dogs and cats
like pet kind of animals
and animals you find in the home
like mice
and all those kind of things
um so mostly animals and he gets from books
and and from tv
we've the tv is on
i filled that out on the sheet
it's on almost all day
i just i watch a lot of tv
and now that i have the baby
that's one of the only things that will keep him preoccupied
so that i can deal with the baby
like when i'm nursing the baby i need him to not get into things
he normally does an excellent job of playing by himself
but
we have those times where i have to put the tv on as a babysitter
it keeps him occupied so
he watches a lot of tv um
even when he's playing he'll play
like simultaneously while he's watching certain shows
um
so i think he actually picks up a lot of things from tv too
but mostly from books i think
so he likes to read a lot
yeah he does
he loves books
he reads with daddy every night before bed
daddy does bed time
and they read at least two books every night
and then we'll typically read one or two
at some point during the day
he'll grab a book and bring it over to me
like good night moon is one of his favorite books
they read that just about every night
and he'll point all the pictures out
or all the things in the pictures he'll point out
and so
i was kinda surprised that i though that might get his attention
but he was like no too busy
yeah
he loves that book
yeah it's probably just more exciting you know the food
it's new and different
a lot of the kids like they get stuck on the food
i think it's just i mean it's cool
a lot of them look pretty real it's just
yeah
and they're kinda weird
yeah these are kinda creepy
the squishy ones are like ew
that feels kinda too real for me
yeah
do you think he recognized some of the food
i do um we we eat a lot
like especially the cake obviously
you can tell mommy likes to make cupcakes
but but yeah
we just has mashed potatoes the other night
and um peas and green beans
like all those kind of things
i had oatmeal for breakfast
so
pizza
he's a big fan of
so yeah i think he recognized quite a bit of it
like he's eaten a lot of these things
like the
like the cheese he picked up and said cheese
so we had that yesterday
does he ever try to like
help you in the kitchen or anything
um
yes he is
he has gotten really into wanting to help
like make his lunch
like he really loves hot dogs
we have hot dogs quite a bit for lunch
and for dinner
um
he's at that stage where he only wants five things
you know
so he likes to help
um
i i let him help me
like like we do it in the microwave
roll the hotdog in in the paper towel
and mommy has to use the knife
and he'll open the microwave door
like i'll hold him up
he'll open the microwave door
put the hotdog in
close the microwave door
and i'll push the buttons
and he pulls it out when it's done
so yeah
he really likes to help
and
when i start to do something
usually it's for him
like if i'm getting his lunch
or his snack
he he comes in and says help i wanna help
and so i have to
he'll point to the chair
i bring a chair into the kitchen
so he can climb up on the chair and watch what i'm doing
with washing the berries or whatever i'm doing
so he wants to he's a big helper lately
so that's kind of fun and exciting
but i don't do a whole lot of cooking
my husband is the cook
um so
and usually
he's starting to eat his dinner
when we're getting our dinner together
and then we kind of all sit down and kind of eat together
since he eats he takes his time obviously
when he's eating
um so yeah i am not in the kitchen a whole lot
actually like cooking
but there's been a handful of times
when i've been in there doing it that i've asked just to keep him
busy
like hey do you want to help mommy
and he'll come help me stir the soup or whatever i'm cooking
and um
so yeah he's starting to want to help more
which is which is cool
and then i mean that's good to if he wants to help with the baby
yeah he's good about like if i ask him to go get her pacifier
or go get her blanket or whatever
he's good about
the burp cloth that's the
i forgot the burp cloth
can you go get me the burp cloth
and he runs and gets the burp cloth
and brings it back
so he's a good helper
aw good brother
yes yes
oh good job aidan
so yeah
so you feel like so you were saying like with the um
like the infants and toddlers he understands a lot
he understands a lot
but he doesn't articulate
and i don't know if it's
i think i think
partially it's
he's he takes after me in that he's a perfectionist
and i think part of it is he knows in his head
i i think he's not getting it out right
like he starts to say like a lot of the times he'll whisper
like the first time he starts to say something he'll whisper it
like
does that sound right
and if it sounds somewhat right
he'll say it again
but if it doesn't he's like no that's not right
ya know
so he's very
cautious i guess in his speech
of that's not right
i don't want to say it unless that's right
um so i think that's part of it
and i think part of it too is just
is just delayed
and so he's definitely starting to talk
he's much more vocal and verbal now than he was six months ago
so
it's definitely it's definitely helping
and maybe it's just timing of things too
but um
but he's getting a lot better
but yeah he understands he understands a ton
like i was even amazed with the pictures
and things that he was pointing out
i was like i didn't know you knew that
haha it's like he knows so much more than i thought he did
but he doesn't say it
so
and there's things that he'll say
but i've only heard him say it like twice
you know
like i know he knows that word
but he's only said it a couple of times
so
it's always interesting filling out those surveys
of well does it count
he's said it once
i know he's said it
he doesn't say it all the time but
yeah sometimes he like
especially with the pictures
they might know it in like the context
of like their house
or whatever he's used to seeing it within the picture
it looks different
or yeah
so some parents are surprised like i thought he knew that
but it's just it could just be
you know it's just a new context or something
right
like with the body parts i thought that was
he knows all of his body parts on him
but to point at it on a picture
was i think a little difficult for him
like that's not my toes
you know he's like
i don't know what that is but my toes are right here
yeah
um is there
was this kind of typical of the other play sessions
yeah
yup
he always gravitated towards
the food items
again it's new and different
and nothing like we have at home
and other times there were like a bunch of books
and he was never interested
like nope i'm too busy doing this to read books
like i'm not in that mood
um and like i said the dolls
he never even went near the dolls
i was trying to i think one time i there was a doll
with a bottle
and i was trying to feed the baby the bottle
and he was completely confused
i breast feed
and so he was like what is that
and i kind of thought that was hilarious
i was like he doesn't even know what this is
so he's like ah i don't know
yeah he
i weaned
he wasn't weaned until he was sixteen months
so yeah that's that was all he knew
he didn't have a bottle very often
so
so yeah this was very typical of the other play sessions
that we had gravitated on this side
with all that stuff
and you said um he's he was more independent
or he's becoming more independent now
and in in the other sessions was he more kind of like
you had to name things for him and do things
um yeah
i was doing a lot of
narrating
i guess
what he was doing
i st i think i still do that but i'm more aware
of it now
just from things that i've learned
from the class that i'm taking or whatever
but yeah it was kind of like i was watching him play
and would narrate what he was doing
and i still do that a little
um
yeah he just he wasn't saying anything
so it's like well
i can at least make sure i'm naming things
so that he's soaking it all in on what these things are
so
so yeah
i'm not familiar with the class
like is it just like they are teaching you like
um it's
yeah they're teaching us techniques
and tips and tools
to
it's basically to get the child to initiate the conversation
so that as opposed to
saying
like a lot of what we did today
the can you say this
and i know that's for purely testing purposes
but they're telling us not to do that
that just to keep repeating the word
like if i was trying to get him to say cup
instead of saying can you say cup
i would just say cup
cup
and kind of wait for him to say it back
um
and now that he's at a point where he's um
more of a
between a first word user
and a combiner of words
he's kind of getting more into that
i don't do as much of that as i do waiting for him to say it
if i know like i know
he says cup everyday thousands of times a day
so i would just hand this to him and wait
for him to identify it
um
so i don't know
it's um
i think it's a canadian
i think the author's i think they're canadian
but yeah it's this whole program
and it's like six weeks long
and they come and do videotape sessions in between
um to kind of mark their progress
and then we he when we're done with the class
they'll reevaluate him to see if he needs to continue on with
the typical home visits with the infants and toddlers program
or if he'll be caught up by then
um
so i'll be really curious to see how that
how that goes
we had him evaluated at he was twenty one months
and they evaluated him at about a twelve month level
as far as his um language
but developmentally and socially
he was right where he should have been
but he was just the language delay was the big
the big factor
so i'm glad we got involved in the program
just to help help us monitor and help us to be more aware
we were never too concerned about it
we were aware that like
he just recently just started saying mama
as to call me
like as opposed to that's mama
but hey mama i need this
or mama come get me out of of bed
um he just started doing that just a few months ago
where as all my friends kids were doing that at you know
a year
so
so that was um a big difference
so yeah the class really is it's teaching me tools
and there's like work book
and we have homework
and i mean it's a class
so
um so yeah it's really just all about
kind of observing
like the thing they've been talking about recently
is the owl concept
to observe wait and listen
which is hard for me to do i don't
it's hard for me too
i'm not very patient
but to observe what he's doing and how he's playing
and then
wait for him to start an interaction
with me
um
and then listening to his lessons
whether they're verbal
or through sign he signs
um
and just kind of you know listening to his messages
and then trying to continue a conversation with him
so that's kind of where we just started it
just a couple of weeks ago
so it's still still pretty new
i'm finding it really interesting
and i'm learning a lot of just basic things
like you know
saying can you say really confuses them
more than just saying the word
they're hearing four words before the thing you were asking them to say
i'm like well that makes sense actually
you know it's like that makes sense
so yeah
that's really cool
yeah i hadn't heard of that
but that's good it gives you something
sometimes if you're receiving services it's like you wanna know what else you can do too
yeah exactly
when you're not coming in or
exactly
exactly
so that's good
and he's yeah he's very social
yeah
i mean he's kind quiet but
yeah
we'll we'll send you the results of everything
okay
but like with the things in the bag
like those are more like looking his visual um perception
and like um fine motor skills
yup
and all that you know he was doing pretty well with that stuff
yeah
so i think all that looks probably fine so
we'll send you that within maybe like four to six weeks
okay
so yeah
i don't know i don't know do you think he'll try the cards
do you think he'll even say them
we can try
if he if he won't say them it's it's like it's alright
a lot of kids you know get tired of these ones
yeah
they can't make it through all of it
but he can try
and that's all we have
you wanna look at these
look what emily has
can you say watch
clock yeah
can you say watch
ah
you know what this is

oh i just have one more thing
we have um
a final consent two final consent forms
oh yeah
um one is
you can scoop her some ice cream too
can you tell me like what you guys play with today
um we did food stuff
the whole time
yeah
did he look at any of the animals at all
um he was interested in taking the paper out but i don't think he was too interested in the animals
and he didn't look into the doll at all
nu huh
is that kinda like the other sessions that he'd usually go for the food
um yeah we've been doing a lot of pretend food at home
um we also do a baby doll at home too
but yeah i think that's what we usually do
i think a lot of kids end up going to the food like the stove and its more like
yeah
does he have like a kitchen at home
oh okay
yeah with like fake food and everything
aw yeah and then you said he has a doll at home
yeah
is it kinda like these dolls or more like a
um mean it's the same concept but it's a little bit smaller and it's a baby instead of like an older girl i guess
is that like when he was having the baby
right
yeah we got that at the same time so yeah
so i change max's diaper and he changes his baby doll's diaper
aw
yeah
and then does he um does he have any animals like this at home or
no not like this
we have some like stuffed animals
um but we don't really do he's not into stuffed animals and we have some like duplo dinosaurs and things like that but um doesn't really play with too much
does he try to you help in the kitchen too
yeah
yeah he'll pretend play with you know real stuff in the kitchen and then sometimes we bake together
do you think he recognized any of the foods like the particular foods you guys were playing with or
i think so um yeah i mean we play pretend ice cream all the time and um
i think he recognized most of that not the beets but like
the cupcakes
and then does he eat any of these things or you guys eat any of these things
uh huh we'll do um ice cream and cupcakes and green beans and hot dogs um we don't really and hamburgers
we don't really do lamb chops
are you all finished
and corn on the cob
did you see the corn on the cob too
he's obviously very rough and tumble as well
well now he's got a little brother to play with
yeah that worked out well
um has he seen any animals in real life like this
yeah we went to the zoo recently and they actually had a like little farm and he was really into the cow because it was so loud
um and the elephants so yeah and we have a dog and cat at home too
oh okay
yeah these particular toys like i think last time they were stuffed animals like theses these were all different
a lot of these are more exotic so like sometimes maybe they see them at the zoo but like
yeah not everyday things yeah
yeah it's funny
was he interested in animals at other sessions like earlier sessions you guys did
maybe
or the dolls or anything
yeah i think before we did the doll a little bit and like the books he wasn't yeah we didn't do the books today
i forget about the animals though i can't remember
does he like to read with you at home with you a lot
yeah we do that before bedtime and he really likes books during playtime too
he seemed to like when you guys were reading earlier he seemed to be enjoying it a lot so
yeah
does he have tools at home at all
um yeah yeah
i don't know if they put them out but there were tools out before
oh okay yeah we do have kinda like fake um pretend tools and also daddy's real tools sometimes if they're safe enough we'll let him play with those too
scoop on my head
thank you
is there anything else that was different you want to tell me about or anything
um from last time
yeah since he's getting older
i don't know
i feel like he's fairly independent
right yeah he does he is able to play by himself sometimes
quite a bit and sometimes he'll tell us to go away so he can do it on his own
um yeah
okay alright well the last thing is just the rest of the book and we can go
okay
oh boy
i don't know if he's gonna wanna
yeah
the room there's like we bounce around
okay
um
okay so can you just tell me about what you guys played with today
we played with
i played with the water animals
jessica played with the food the kitchen stuff
okay
and was there anything that she like were any favorites she had
sushi
she was playing with the ice cone trying to take the top off of the cone and put it back on
and is there anything she didn't seem interested in playing with at all
the toys i liked
the animals
the animals
in their little habitats
did she go after the dolls at all
no she didn't
no or the um trying to think of what else we have
did she just stay with the food
she did mostly the food
do you think she recognized some of the um the food she played with
i think some of it
like she called the purple thing grapes
though i don't they were actually grapes
but like that's what she thought
grapes
do you think like has she seen you eat any of the things we have or has she eaten some of them
yah sushi
yah
pizza
grapes
yah
does she ever try to help you
oh ice
does she try to like help you in the kitchen at all
yes
yah
i let them do the salad spinner
oh yah
let them spin the salad
oh yah
i couldn't did she
did she know what the stove was like i wasn't really watching
i think so she was turning it on and off
and she she like gets hot and cold
like she likes she's fascinated with stoves
we have to keep her away from ours
yah
um and do you think
she recognized some of the animals at all
yah whale shark
no actually she said dolphin for both dolphin and shark
so she likes water animals
have you guys been to like the aquarium
no we're gonna do that this weekend i think
ah oh cool
we were gonna do it for her birthday but they close at five everyday
oh
except for friday
is that the baltimore one
i've never been there
it's really awesome
really i have to go check it out
um and then you said you have like similar toys at home
yah we have like they're a little bit smaller but we have a whole big thing of fish
and then we have a thing of like different water toys
there's dolphins and whales and sharks and
so she's familiar with those ones
have you guys ever been to like the zoo or like a farm
farm yes
zoo not since she was a baby
so she probably wouldn't like
associate the a zoo with anything right now
till we do it again
there's like a lot of like exotic animals like this time
yah
so like weird like zoo type of things you know
yah
did she um in the other sessions did she play with the food mostly
yah she's always kinda played with the food for the most part
every now and then she'd pick up a baby
but she didn't do that this time
does she have
oh do you need this room
oh okay
does she have any um baby dolls at home at all that she plays with
she has baby dolls she plays
she has a stuffed animal that's her favorite that she plays with all the time
it like uh
lotso from toy story
i actually have that
that's so funny
she loves lotso
that's cute
and you said she has two siblings
or three siblings
two sibli
well jillian's with us all the time
okay
um and then her half brother is with us every other weekend
and does do they play a lot together
they do he plays more with jillian now cause shh'ell he'll share his ipad with her
and she'll play with that but he's good with both of them
and she's them two play a lot together
yes
they're what two years apart
yah two and a half
yah um
yah i'm surprised she didn't ask where she was
a lot of times they're like where's
i think she does having that time away
so and julie goes to school in the afternoons now
so she's used to being away from her half the day
true yah
um and then does she she like to read with you a lot
i don't think
i think we had a couple books
at night we do before bed
and like i'll let them alternate pick
i'll pick two books and i'll let them alternate picking which one of the two we read
and she does have a couple of books she loves
yah i think
she's always enjoyed that
i think at the last play sessions we had a bunch of books
um does she usually like to go for those during the play sessions like
no
she goes for the food
the food
so this was this session like very different from other ones
or pretty similar
no i think she's always kinda been drawn to the play food
and we have a play kitchen at home with a bunch of play food
that's always a favorite for the kids
um do you think she plays any different now
like any more independently
like maybe
probably a little bit more now
she's gotten a little bit more independent as she's gotten older
she's really sorta like
she definitely like takes stuff and goes off on her own with it now
yah that's what she kept doing today yah
um
i'm trying to think if there's anything else
was there anything else you wanted to tell me about or anything else
no not that i can think of
she's so friendly and she's so like she's very like interested in everything so it was easy to get through everything so
good
yah had a lot of fun
okay i guess that's it
thank you so much for coming in
but you gotta get all the toes in
you're welcome
okay
leah can you play with devin
so what types of things did you notice that she was playing with
okay
what was she drawn to
fake food
because we have that at home
she has one of those shopping carts
um
totally different food though
so i think that's why she liked the cupcakes
or anything like that
um
she has some animals
we go to the zoo a lot
because we have that national zoo membership
so i was kinda trying to see if she
because we don't have the play animals at home
i was trying to see if she'd play with them
yeah i heard you using some kind of obscure words
the lemur
cause thankfully the national zoo is really nice
and they got a lot of stuff
she knows a lot more animals
like when we'll go
she'll go that's the panda
that's the fox
that's the
the lemur was new
we just watched
um
madagascar
and they have lemurs
so we were doing the lemur dance at home
um
she has a baby doll
at home
a lot less clothing
but shoes fascinate her
she actually had to get tie shoes for school
because she kept taking her velcro ones off
so she likes to dress and undress her baby doll
who just has like a shirt that we put on and off
does she do the tie shoes
she keeps them on
yeah
because we double not them
um
other clothes that worked
um
no
she tried to put the skirt on the little girl's head
um
cause she's just starting to like dress herself
like in the morning
she'll wanna help
and we'll put her feet in
and she goes
okay i pull up
so the whole dressing thing
is still kind of new
um
i thought she'd like the magnetic toy more
cause she has one at home
but it's down in the basement
so she doesn't play with it as much
it's not where
our normal play area
but she didn't go for it
she did however
try and pack all of those animals
in the little girl's lunch
which i thought was funny
cause that's a big deal in the morning
is getting her lunch box
to go to school
and what did she pack in the lunch box
um
we got a hot dog in there
which makes sense
cause she gets hot dogs
for her lunch sometimes
and then
she packs all of the magnetic animals
so
there's no vegetarianism in our house
yes
um
what other foods does she play with
she liked the mashed potatoes
and the ice creamed cone
which is funny
cause she doesn't really get ice cream at home
um
i don't know
she kinda picked them up
and set them down
the orange juice she likes
she loves orange juice
and she likes juice
that's what she was feeding the baby
the little juice can
but her juice boxes at home have a straw
so i think she was confused
she kept holding it up
and i was like
there's no straw
sorry
um
okay
and there were particular
sets of animals that you were looking at
i know the zoo for awhile
yeah
we played with the aquarium
for a little bit
cause she loves penguins
and she has a stuffed penguin
she sleeps with
cause we get
penguin and panda before she goes to bed
so the penguin she loves
monkey's we really like
i'm trying to think
who else she picked up
for the aquarium
oh and she kept grabbing the cow
to tell me what noise he made
oh and panda
she found panda
but she was gonna put panda at the aquarium
so
yeah
cause at one point
she picked up zebra
she was putting zebra at the farm
at the zoo
and then we did the farm
but some of the animals
she sees at the little petting zoo farm
we go to weren't here
cause i think she was looking
for like the rabbit
and the goats that they can go in and play with
no we actually didn't get down there
cause that was
she just wasn't feeling well last weekend
so we just kind of avoided it
so i know you've done
did you come in for the eighteen month play session
no
they just had us do a survey or something
so what difference
i mean it's been a long time
yeah
cause the one we did
the last one we did
would've been i guess at her year mark
and all we had was fake food
and a doll
she just sat
and kinda threw the fake food around a little bit
at that point
she kept going after the fake peas
cause that was like her favorite food
that week was fake peas
or the jars of peas or whatever
um
but now
like we've even noticed it the last couple of weeks
she doesn't really need us as much
she likes to just do her own thing
she's
is it nap time
like she'll just kinda do her thing
and then she'll come to us
if she wants us to read the book
or like take the shoes off
but she's very much like
on her own
yeah
what is it
i guess she wants to take her outside
if you're okay with it
we're fine with it
you know
let's go on a field trip
and then you mentioned
that you have some of the similar toys at home
yeah
like she has fake food
she's got a shopping cart
that's just full of
i don't even know
kraft foods
like canned soup
and ice cream
and fruits and vegetables
she has that at her school also
cause her lunch box
recently came home with four or five pieces of fake food
but some of the other things
like the kiwi
and the sushi
and like the mash potatoes
those aren't in her kit
so she kind of picked those up a little bit
and the oatmeal that looks like throw up
yeah
that thing is disgusting
but she does eat oatmeal
occasionly at home
so i think that
she kinda looked at it
for a second
well um
great
so what what types of things were
i wasn't really paying attention
what types of things was she interested in playing with
oh um the various pieces of fruit and vegetables and
stuff like that
in particular the juice cup
the juice cup
and um what other food items i thought i heard some things that she was
oh um well she repeat but she saw that sushi
and then the um hot dogs
it was really just everything she was kinda grabbing and just putting all the articles into the uh pot
okay
and stirrin it up a little bit
okay do you guys have play food at home
no we don't i should get some
yeah she i don't kids love play food
yeah
i heard um she's never had ice cream before
but she knows
yogurt
she thought it was yogurt
okay
um and i like i like that she i heard mashed potatoes she likes big words
yeah that's true yeah yeah
that's great
um what other things was she looking at
um so she looked at the um cupcakes of course
yeah
the cupcakes i tried to get her to move her over here with the animals but she didn't seem to be as interested at the animals
okay
and so like yeah so like the banana
but i think she's more like how many things she can get into the pot regardless of what it was
and then when she maximized the pot she went back over to the bowl
and put everything over into the bowl
oh and did you guys have that book at home
yeah
so she's really familiar with it
yeah it seemed to calm her down a little bit
i think she thought it was i think she thought it was like oh its time to go sleep good
yeah yeah yeah ready for that
which the other one as well were you reading that
nope we don't i was reading that one but we don't have that that particular book
the one two three good night moon
okay
so at one point i was reading the moon the good night moon and then she was reading the other book
and i was reading out loud and she was saying some words out loud
okay
alright and and compared to i don't did you come in for an eighteen month session
compared to eighteen months do you
yeah
i mean can you can you tell me the differences that you've noticed
well i i guess it wasn't you but at eighteen month i was really concerned that she was not meeting the mark because i was comparing her to all the other babies that we had like play group with
and they were well all the other so the two other babies that are in her play group they were talkative and and tried to say different things and nyla was just kinda like not doing a whole lot
and um that same two months so i was kinda concerned that she wasn't on track
and then just in the last few months you know she's kind of um started saying a lot of words and doing she's just much more um social and outgoing
well she's always been pretty social but i think i was just i think i just seen she's much more curious and
yeah does that make sense
yeah
sure
seems weird that's a little bit of time but
no not at all
oh okay
not at all no i mean every every kid is different there's so much variability at this age
so um she just figured it out huh everything started to click
i guess so
maybe she was sizin us up
um so so that play session what types of things was she playing with in comparison
oh sorry i'm sorry i thought you meant like a overall
no no no that's yeah no no both
well no she's always she's been interested in the things
last time she was stacking the food more so than anything else
it could be i was doing it too so she started stacking the food
uh now she's like i think she's trying to imitate me with the cooking with the pots and the stirring
um and then she was she never really put anything in her mouth before
i think at the end she started to wander around the room at the eighteen months like she wanted to just give up and not stay remain situated
um she she played with the doll a little bit more i think she called it baby you know at least now that i
this time around she's not interested at in at all in the dolls
interesting yeah yeah does the food do her too much
yeah
for the eighteen months they did you guys didn't play with food did you
no they had some well not this amount
did they
they had some uh they had like the hamburger was there there was like the cheese to make a sandwich there was like bread like a little
yeah
remember us doing that
so they didn't have this to this extent but
yeah yeah
and i don't remember the animals last time but
yeah okay
well i think i think she's doing good she's a great kid
yeah she's fun
and she persevered
yeah she did
so
one session i came in and um you know we were in the room and with the television it was dark
and the woman came and cut it off early and i was like oh what happened she was like oh she's asleep
she was sitting there and then she just
