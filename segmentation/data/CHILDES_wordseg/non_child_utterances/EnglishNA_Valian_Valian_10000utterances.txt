yeah kean'll be here
maybe i'll take him
kean'll be here for the week
two weeks
kean is coming for two weeks
two weeks yes
so you're not going down
he's just staying
he's skipping school for two weeks
no no no this is winter break
oh this is normal winter break for him
yeah
oh
i'm not sure if it's one week or two weeks but at least a week
child kean is coming for a week
yeah he knows that
who's coming on friday
do you remember who's coming on friday in an airplane
right
child
are you gonna kean how you climbed out of the crib
are you proud of yourself
it wasn't so much fun to fall on your head though was it
what happens when you climb out of your crib
do you fall on your head
actually the second time he didn't land on his head
oh
oh
he's learning to swing his feet around
what he must do he must just pull himself straight up and then just go over
that's right
that's the only way i can imagine
and once he learns to rotate around it'll be okay
it's still a long drop
so it's a long drop he's that's not that long if he holds on
it's a soft rug
actually if he keeps doing it then i'll know
yeah if he keeps doing it we should just block off the stairs and make sure there's nothing dangerous upstairs and let him do what he wants
no that's what i mean we'll lower the sides so that he can
no i know that but i mean also he'll probably just wander around in the upstairs and we ought to make sure there's nothing he can get his hands on
unfortunately it's impossible to block off
oh the stairway i think he knows not to go down the stairs by himself
yeah you have blue marker on your hand
that's you were drawing yesterday remember
writing you were writing yesterday
you wanna wash your hands
when you finish your breakfast you can wash your hands
after breakfast
actually those markers don't come off as easily as i had hoped
water soluble huh
they say they're water soluble and i tested them out on myself before i gave them to him
i drew on myself and i washed it off and i drew on the table and i washed it off
but somehow he gets it embedded better
yeah
did you wait till it dried before you washed it off or did you do it right away
i probably didn't
i was impatient
oh

that must be very exciting
it's not working very well right now though is it child
we haven't actually ridden in it but we've turned it on and made the buckets go up and down

we learn from mr rogers too
do you watch mr rogers on television
i understand mr rogers came and gave a talk at college
last year
really
here at the at college
yeah
neat
i thi i think he's really interesting
most of my friends think he's a jerk and i don't know why
oh really
because i don't know if they're judging him i mean i've watched every day with child so i ya know i know what's on it
i don't know if they judge him because he's a little bit effeminate and all that
i don't know if that's why they think i'm not sure if that's the things he talks about are fascinating
ya know and he talks about things that you wouldn't think of talking about with kids
at least that i wouldn't
he was talking about the first day of school about a couple a days before school started and he wasn't talking about how children feel about going to school but how their mommies feel when the children are at school and the fact that their mommies miss them and what their mommies might be doing while they're at school
just you know just interesting things
i like it

seemed like a good idea
why don't we not put on the floor child okay you usually have to color on the table
child
you know why
you know why
because they'll get on the rug and that's not good
otherwise we'll be putting them away okay
if you can't put on the bucket we'll have to put them away
okay
your your rule usually is that you have to color up on the table
right child
no they're not
observer's got them now
did ya ever
you need one
okay which one do you want
okay
where'd it go
der there it is
whoops
child
that's not good
okay we're gonna put them away now
okay
we'll find something else to do because you know that's not good
right
maybe you can tell me about some more of the things in here

this is a great book
i think it's quite nice actually
oh by harry mcroth
this is the same guy that we have a lot books by him
oh yeah
i thought the drawings themselves were nice
they're very clear
yeah
a lot the books that i looked at aren't so clear
we have a bunch of books by him
is that yours or child's
no that was child's
oh we have a bunch of books by him
what's that
what is that
oh thank you
there you go you show observer what was in the picture
there ya go
oh which one is that on here
which one's big
and which one's small
oh this end is bigger than this end
you're right
that's called perspective
well because this end is closer
see if we can do it with this rolling pin
this end is closer to you so it looks bigger
and this end is farther away so it looks smaller
but they're really the same size
in this picture they're really the same size too
you'll learn about that when you get to about fifth grade child
isn't it weird how they notice things like that
yeah
that's really nice

when we get back from hawaii that's when we're just gonna start making christmas cookies
okay
we made em last year the flour
my mother came in and we just had it was just the biggest mess in the whole world but that for some reason that day i didn't care about it
so we had so much fun
oh and he ate tons and tons a dough ha child
it was great
he must have been a very little baby then
he was big enough to make a good mess
wasn't it
what else is in this pic child y you have to be really gentle with this
remember the rule about this
where does the rolling pin always stay
on the floor
it stays on the floor because it's so big and heavy
you can roll it around with you
what is that for
that's for making pies but mommy doesn't use that
it's for rolling out pie dough so the pie dough won't stick on the table
but mommy doesn't like that i just use wax paper instead
okay
okay

you almost can't buy anything without batteries anymore
batteries or else it all comes apart
we used to try to keep everything on the shelves and it's just really hard to do that

they've gotta play with it and it's all going in baskets
o you've got the elephant
here's the porcupine
show parent the porcupine
she was throwing it before wasn't she
are you going to share it
doesn't parent get something
hoarding everything
you know what she will do lately that i thought was kinda cute
if parent cries or gets hurt she'll offer her her blanket
parent doesn't have a special blanket yet
i don't know why i guess i just haven't had one for her
but to her that's really important to give her sister the blanket
and i thought well how sweet to think well that'll comfort her because that's what comforts her
when she gets hurt she gets her blanket
she gives parent her blanket and sometimes her teddy bear
hi
hi there squirt
they're as different as night and day
are they
parent's very quiet and easy going and jamie not now but she gets really wound up almost hyper sometimes
she does talk a lot
what are you doing
tells me which way to go in the car
what are you doing
you better not do that
you know what
you might choke
let's see
don't pull that thing out cause you know what'll happen
all the air will come out of the duck and then he'll be a flat duck
he won't squeak anymore
what's that
right there with the orange stripes
seems to me that those were twenty nine or thirty two dollars before and now i think i saw them yesterday for twelve dollars
ninety six
what is it
it's the kuzoo the cabbage patches' um pet i guess

you know i mean they do so many things
you want more toys

why don't you show me some of your toys
you want to show her investigator one what some of your toys are
what's jamie's toys
parent's sister is eleven and they play
it's like i feel it's all i can do to take care of them
and i was thinking the other day that we don't sit down and
but like she doesn't know all her colors or her numbers and things
i know other people who have two year olds
it's not like they're extra smart
it's just that people have taken time
and she will pick up on things
if you tell her something she'll remember it
but i just haven't had the time
i've been so busy with diapers and keeping everybody clean that i feel negligent in that way
well then i thought she will pick up on it
it's a learned thing
colors are learned and numbers and
colors i think kids really don't get them down until they're five
they really have a hard time
are you going to take my microphone
where are some of your toys jamie
right there
you've got so many

you've said some sentences while i've been here

they don't fit
they're the same size
she's just started singing lately
she makes up these little songs and sings aloud
are you biting that dog
poor dog
he's crying
now she's really convinced
at least we both know how to whine
did you hear the doggie
you're biting his feet
ouch
are you gonna have a dog for lunch
where is the other dog
is there another one
there's two horses and one dog i think
there's only one
here's the zebra
that's his tail
where's the other where's the elephant's tail
that's a duck
that's his wing
that's another wing
by his feet
there's his tail
that's his feet
that's his feet
there's his tail in the back
there's his tail
see
there
there's his tail
isn't it funny they know to turn everyt to look at the tail
don't bite it cause investigator one has to take that duck back to school
yeah i have to take him back with me
and she'll get in trouble
right
you wanna put him back in the bag for her
you want the duck
where's parent's pacifier
she's knows what parent's pacifier is but for some reason she call's it
parent's mouth
cause it goes in parent's mouth
you're sharing
you gave parent the ball
i don't know how many balls they went through this summer because jamie and her sister would go outside and play ball and jamie always threw it in the rose bushes
so we have all these deflated beach balls
i see something i better take from parent before parent
ahhah
why don't you give the duck a ride on your boat
go get your big boat and give the duck a ride on the boat
that's a good idea
where's the duck
now he's lost
i think he's by parent's leg
okay
you gonna give him a ride now
tell parent you'll be right back
that's not the boat
where's your boat
he looks pretty up there
you think if you put him there that he can stay here right
it's terrible not to be able to have anything on the coffee table anymore
i can't stand it
my table cloth is gone my knicknacks my cactus except that cactus
everything is in disarray for years to come
he can sit right here
see
it's a good place for him right here
why don't you put him on the rug on the floor on the bear
put the boat on the bear on the floor
oh that's pretty there
i like that
he's happy
you know when you're around your children all the time you get used to the way the talk
like i told you for writing she says ai and i know what she's talking about
every time you go somewhere or if you're gonna leave em with somebody you feel you have to leave this dictionary because you're so afraid that someone is not gonna understand em
she speaks pretty clearly though
are you biting my duck again
i have to take that duck back with me
what if it's broken
don't break his beak
don't bite him
investigator one has to
look now she's doin what she saw jamie do
he won't fit
put him in the front
you forgot that your boat toots didn't you
he's too fat
isn't that funny
we don't have anything that squeaks and of all things that fascinates them
they don't have any squeak toys
he doesn't fit there honey
he'll fit right here
see
he fits there
see
you're too big
we were on vacation in a big boat
did you go on a big boat
did you ever go to centerville in toronto
the little amusement park on the island
isn't it cute
we had a nice day
it was absolutely pouring and we thought well we'll go anyway
and there was nobody there but yet it was still open
when we were on the train i said
oh god please can't you stop make it raining
this is really bad
when we got off the train it was finished
the rain was done and we had a real nice day
that's great
went on a big boat
are you biting the horse too
you're biting his mouth
don't bite the horse
take him out of your mouth dirty
you wanna go on a horsie
outside
we don't have very many places for kids just to ride ponies and things
i guess because the insurance is probably so high
horse or pony
yeah i don't know if they have it any more
what's that
what's that
this blue thing
what do you do with this blue thing
tell parent not to touch
you know it's too bad you're not able to video tape at the same time because you miss a lot
lulls in the conversation their actions speak too
yeah
we always have the person who came to see the kids do the transcription of the tape because you remember a lot
but i know you miss a lot
are most children shy when you pop in like this
yeah
which is too bad in a way because even though they're talking you're still not seeing the real child
yeah
it's too bad you can't do a month's study just getting friendly with the kids
calm down
phone books and catalogs
they used to be stacked up very neatly
o
where is em
in the summer
it's too cold outside right now
see the kids
do you see the kids and people
isn't it funny how books will bring them out
i think that's all
it's too cold
it's freezing
there's some shoes
you have some don't you
can you tell parent to get out of there and close the door
thank you
there's some more shoes
yeah
okay
yeah it's funny
they always get warmed up toward the end
what
what'd you say
they're going to sleep
those aren't pajamas
those are shorts
you have some
where's the christmas catalog
shopping
is it j c penney's or sears
the victim of little hands
i just saw something that she really liked
where is it
mommy's got another book
do you wanna see the shoes again
who's that
right
santa clause
are you gonna show investigator one some more things
find the christmas things
i don't know
can you say
clock
oh parent
you do
see the dolls
look at the dolls
see the baby dolls
you just passed them
bicycles
shall we find the dolls again
there they are
what's this world coming to
ugly ugly
punk rock dolls
they are ugly
i could see if they had pretty faces with makeup but they're just ugly
i still like my shirley temple doll and i had betsy wetsy all those madam alexander dolls
do they look like daddy's pants
what are these
there's a gumball machine
see
when we go to the store okay
when we go to the store you can get some
there's exercise
remember going through the catalogs and circling everything you want
i remember
what is it
what is it
we have a speak and spell
mommy has to send it to texas instruments to be fixed
i don't know what i did with it
i put it away somewhere
i called them about it
what's
axercise
can you say
exercise
no
okay
are there any cars any cars in there
oh oh
you tore the magazine
my father used to always tell us to be careful that santa clause would send a bill every year
my eleven year old was talking to her girl the other day and they were they were saying
do you still believe in santa
she said
yes my mother says if you really believe that there is one
and i thought it's really funny they don't really wanna give it up but they have a feeling
that's kinda cute in a way
it makes you feel really responsible
they don't tell anybody because they make fun of them
when she gets older
jamie that book is getting all torn up and you won't be able to read it
yeah
can i have the catalog
please
may i please
wait a minute
can you pick up investigator one's toys for her and animals
yeah i have to get ready to go home in a little while
can you say hi
hi
where's all the animals jamie
what's that
what goes in there
no
somebody's sleeping
do you wanna get investigator one's toys for her
do you wanna help me put my toys away
put em in the bag
she has to go home
no
she has to take her toys with her
yeah
but you wanna help me put em away
would you help me
i'd like that
now the destructive jamie's coming out
magazine
i finally decided what's the difference if i go shopping to buy toys or if i just run through penney's and sears and charge em
cause you can still go to the store every week and make a twenty five dollar payment or something as if you were puttin on lay away
it saves you all that running around
right
you want the girl to come back

noah opened the door of the ark and two by two the animals hurried in
when all had been done as god had ordered noah closed the door
look at all those animals
rain began to pour down
creeks became rushing rivers
rivers flowed into lakes
lakes joined to make a great ocean
and the ark was lifted off the land
look at that
there it goes
i think they're all closed up inside so they don't get wet anymore when it's raining
you you've been rained on
did you get wet
in all the world nothing was left but noah and his family and the animals on the ark
look at that
there's noah and everybody on that big boat all by themselves on this big ocean
they're all inside there nice and dry eating eating all the things that they took for them that noah took for them
what do you think they eat
do they
the horses eat hay right
and maybe like
maybe the giraffes and some of those animals eat hay too

look at that
the ark was noisy and crowded
and noah and his family were kept very busy
they brought food and water to the animals
they swept the stalls and cleaned the cages

he never wants to have his feet exposed
really
like the minute i remove his dirty socks i have to put on clean ones right away
he never wants to go barefoot
that's amazing
i know
i don't know why
and he won't let me cut his toe nails
you have special feet in there right

sacred
yes
where are these shoes from
i don't remember
some store
what are those called child
what did mommy tell you shoes like that are called

what is this study studying
oh i'm interested in how parents and children talk
and i'm mostly interested in um do you like does he imitate you
that kind of thing
oh
i'm interested in the language aspects
yeah he repeats everything
i think he's stuck
i don't think he can fit in there
it looks a little too small
he could go through that tunnel again
that's another kind of tunnel
that's a tunnel too
lots of tunnels there
that's a little tiny tunnel
no i don't think he can fit do you
that's the axle of the wheels
where's the motor
oh
yeah that's like a hill
you keep bumping your head
poor guy
are you gonna lie down
probably that's a good idea
keep you head out of the way
where's child
oh there i see his eye
do you see investigator over there
oh they must be hiding
they're in their garage
right
they can see you
can you see them
watch your head
oh that's a tunnel under there too

watch your head
watch out
oh
what do those trucks make
in that red part on the back
what do they mix up in there
yeah
you know
what are they called
cement mixer
right
that's where they mix the cement in that back part
and then they dump it out to make sidewalks
that's a wheel
oh
that's right
and then they take the wheel full of cement and pour it somewhere else
did you ever see anyone do that
that's the garage
i have to get simon
i can see him winding up here
okay
here comes simon
what is that
that's a collie dog remember
and you know what
last time you named him wolfie
right
that's right
remember wolfie
yeah i know
but wolfie wasn't a dog was he
what was wolfie
maybe that's why he wants to keep his toes covered
maybe
no this was before that
this all started a long time ago
that would convince me to keep my toes covered
um what kind of an animal was wolfie
was he a dog
no
what was he
what was wolfie
did he fly
didn't he have
what color was he
tell investigator what he looked like
was he green
you know
don't open it
i think there's stuff you don't wanna touch in there
no that's
what is that
it's the fireplace
you know child
these are all things you know you're not allowed to touch
that's the poker
the poker
well let me see which one you're pointing to
is that the broom
then why do you ask me
simon has really black hair
i know
he had a lot more
he's lost a lot
that's the poker
and the other one is called the shovel
no that's the poker
that's the poker
you'd better put that back there kiddo
put that right back child ralphy
we poke the logs around to make the fire go better
let me see
that's the broom
to sweep the ashes away
that's the shovel
that's to shovel all of the ashes into a bag and throw it away
now why don't you come over here and not touch that anymore
you know what it is
why don't you come over and say hello to simon
yeah
simon wants to say hello to you
you know what that is
come on over
simon's looking for you
no you can't bang on there
i don't think that's a good thing to bang on
no it's not
child please stop that now
investigator doesn't like it when you do things like that
i don't i don't like it
it's too noisy for me
yeah
what are those

let me see if i can do it
sometimes i have a hard time and i wanna see if i know how
should i try
okay
i'm makin the loops
okay
did i do it right you think
does that look like
i think that's it right
that looks good
it looks kinda like the other one
should i put a knot in it

then it'll look just like the other one
it'll have a fat knot in the middle
there now they look just alike
pretty good huh

what about the monkeys
i love the monkeys
what
what
you wanna come on the what
on the platform
what platform
oh you mean where the elephant was
they had a platform and you could climb up on the elephant
oh
but we didn't let child do that
probably a good idea
because he never would've gotten off
you know what that book's about
you've seen that book
oh what's that
wait i just saw something that we just talked about last night
what's that
is that the castle
who lives in the castle

what did the ginger bread man say to the cow
run run as fast as you can
you can't catch me
i'm the ginger bread man

the three little pigs and
i know
little red riding hood
the grimm's fairy tales are really awful
i know they are
they're frightening

don't swing that belt around please
do i have to take it from you
then please stop it
if you do it again mom's going to take it
yeah i think that's not a good thing to do
cause it's stretchy and when you let go it springs back and it can hit you
it hits your face

the people should be safe
they shouldn't get run over by cars
i thought the people were in jail
they've gotta go to the hospital now

when we're near cars

over dick
poor dick the policeman
you think he likes to be run over with the car
in the road

did she hurt your feelings by saying no to you is that what happened
let her have dick
let her have dick
it keeps her happy okay
you know she's just a baby
oh really
is that why she didn't cry
i think she didn't cry because she has dick in her hand
see if you take dick away and you say no then she gets mad and she cries
let's not try it
you have all those people to play with
so she can have dick
well let's trade let's give her one of those instead
