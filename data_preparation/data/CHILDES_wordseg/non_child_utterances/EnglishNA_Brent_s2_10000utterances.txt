the grinch hated christmas the whole christmas season

no one

i think we'll put this one up
mommy doesn't want you to break it
there's the grinch
but i think that the most likely reason of all may have been that his heart was two sizes too small
but whatever the reason his heart or his shoes he stood there on christmas hating the whos
staring down from his cave with a sour grinchie frown
at the warm lighted windows below in their town
for he knew every who down in whoville beneath was busy now hanging a mistletoe wreath
