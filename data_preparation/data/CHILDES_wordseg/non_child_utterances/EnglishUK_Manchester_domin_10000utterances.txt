diesel sort of goes doodoo
like that
because he's got he's got a siren rather than anything else hasn't he
well
he probably does say get out the way as well
it's probably the driver says that
it's not to tell people to get out the way
it's to warn them he's coming
isn't it
so as all the passengers are ready
where's percy
so where's the diesel then
can you get the diesel

it doesn't
honestly
alright then
i'm not going to argue with you

okay
oh
you're gonna going to put petrol in the policecar

that doesn't need as much petrol as the lorry dominic

that's not very good idea
because you should really put the petrol in in about there
you don't put it in there
you put it about there
okay
no
you don't
that's because you're just putting petrol all over the driver
i don't think he likes that

i all i said to you was if you're not gonna going to play with them put them away
that's simple enough
simple enough
and you had to be awkward
it's alright
i'm not bothered

well
it's up to you
you have to behave then don't you

because i'm not
i'm not taking you to the shop with me while you're being like this
you can stay at home

it will do
because you've made it
you have to make it so that it's flat
like that
we're gonna going to have a tunnel now are we
no
how about using um the red car
there it is
so you'll have to make it wide enough for the car
yes

you don't need to blow it
what's in there
just cows
and
making a farm now
right
so we need to get these bricks
that's a
it's a big one is it
that's a little one
so
i'm making a farm am i
doesn't it
let's have a look
okay
are we gonna going to make a big one
how do you know it's a lady
it's a lady is it
you've decided it's a lady
oh
i was just asking
you said it was
that was mummy's fault wasn't it
right
we've got the horse in there
i'm afraid you're going to have to wait while i
that's it
i know
it's because i was
let's make it so they can get in and out
so
that's where they come in and out
you have the dog with the horse
i think the dog will get upset
you've got a pig in there as well
can you see it
horse what
happy
no
shall i make a little area for the the pigs
got the pigs in here
where's the dog
two
three
where
so
we've got three pigs
so
that's the area for the pigs
and
oh right
is he keeping watch over the animals
well
the cows don't climb up
not like that anyway
what're you doing
one chicken
well
this actually looks like a goose dominic
alright then
it's a chicken
i willn't argue with you
now
we need to make a little area for which ones
alright then
okay
you can't just throw them in
you wouldn't do that if you were a real farmer would you
eh
isn't it
you look like a little jewish boy
dominic
you don't just throw the little animals in there like that
they willn't be very happy
oh
it makes sense if you put it somewhere like that
then they can't
the little animals can't get out can they
then
we could open it
and move that brick
and then they they could come out
like that
they can all come out then can't they
if they were standing up
i think they're drunk
that one lay down
oh
well
that's alright then
is that one's you've decided that one's a lady horse

because you were a bit too fast for it
you put your big foot on it then
can i have a play
yeah
this train

the train's gonna going to come off the track because the track's broken look

i want to do i
how do you know i want to
oh
alright then
but i haven't got a train
so

no
no
don't bother
don't bother
because i know where they are
no

alright then
i'll play with this one seeing as you're going off
well

don't bother
i don't want one now
i'll play with your cars
honestly
thank you anyway
oh dear
beware
oh dear
you're being a bit rough
that's why it keeps coming off
there
now
you'd better slow down with it
or they will be coming off the track
you'll have to move your track on on a bit
that's it
there's feet on the line
vroom
no
you went too fast
look
there's a passenger waiting for the
was waiting for the train
you're supposed to give him a lift
not kick him off
you're supposed to stop and put him on the train
well well
we know what you think of pooh bear don't we
now
let pooh bear ride on the back
you have to go slowly
well
there you go
that wasn't very nice was it
oh
i think you're gonna going to have to slow down a bit
oh
right
pooh bear's gonna going to stand here and insist that he gets a lift
now
can i have a lift
please can i have a lift
no
why not
i'll give you a penny
two pennys
three pennys
four pennys
goodness
we are noisy aren't we
keep you prisoner now
excuse me
this is the same child that shuts every door
in such such as way that i think he's gonna going to trap his fingers
so i don't think that's very fair
telling me not to shut door
why
well
winnie the there
are you gonna going to pick him up then
no
you have to go very slow
and keep the train on the track
no no no
is it alright if your sister has one of your vans
no
that's pooh bear
don't you want him now
want to what
winnie pooh hasn't got a van
no
he hasn't
where's his van then
oh no
the track's broken
can you fix it
you're supposed to say i can't but i know a man who can
well
daddy can fix it can he
the train fell off the track did it
did you play with the other train
you have got another one
daddy brought it for you last week
you remember that little one
the little wind up thomas with the key
did you play with that last night
you'll get it soon
not yet
no
i know
it will do
and i'll fix it up later
but only if you tidy up this mess
because i'm not gonna going to put it out if you've got all these things out
because we need some space for it
not enough space
it needs at least this much space
and you've got to leave it alone
you have to let it run round the track
and not keep picking it up like you do
oh boy
who's not putting their hand over their mouth
who's not putting their hand over their mouth
go away
you can't tell the train and the truck to go away
that's not very fair
why can't he go on the back
why not
what's moved
it goes back together
who's not putting their hand over their mouth
who's gonna going to get tickled until he do
there
what're you gonna going to do with that
on back
will it stay
it willn't stay like that
i think you have to put it that way
like that
if you go too fast it'll fall off
i wonder if you'll love trains if you're older
or if you'll have grown out of it by then
i know
because you're going too fast for it
can i take it
why not
a
i've got to get the letter a
you find me the letter a then
what letter's this one then
what letter's that one
no
what letter is it
okay
you find me the letter a
if you can
well done
can you find me the letter e
e
where's the e
where is it
well
can you fetch it for me please
yes
that's right
well
it's not really supposed to be on the track darling
in real life if you found a car on the track the train would knock it off
there'd be a crash
oh
vroom
oh sorry
sorry
oh
is the train helping the car
well
what's the car doing on the track
because cars don't go on tracks like that dominic
cars don't go on tracks like that you know
no
they don't
no
they don't
funny enough
there
oh
grrr
why did you do that
dominic
be careful
don't you
sorry
why not
is do you think it's gonna going to squash your car
well
you sit on your cars all the time
oh
dominic
mind your foot
oh
that's it
oh
i'm sorry dominic
i thought you wanted me to help you
oh

hey
are you not talking to me now
who's that
i know it can't go
well

they're supposed to stay on there dominic
trains don't crash as often as that you know
despite everything
does that join with that one
doesn't it
it does
there you go
oh dominic
let her have something
that's very generous of you
is it alright if she has postman pat's van
okay
well
she it's because she's grabbing things
i willn't let her eat it
you used to do things like that
wait until you she's a bit bigger and she clouts you over the head with one of them
dominic
don't get upset
she's only moving them
she's not doing any harm
she's only moving them
she's not doing any harm
don't worry about it
alright
oh
leave it there
right
i'll move it back over here if you don't want it
you are a little
you are a little horror
now
it's gone from being just a train track to being everything else
you're not not sure what you want to play with are you
well
what do you want to play with
oh
train and cars
dominic
trains don't always crash
that's what i keep saying to you
i know on your thomas video they crash but they don't always you know
honestly
gordon fell in a ditch because he was being naughty
gordon didn't fall in the hole
thomas fell in the hole
no
he didn't fall in a hole
gordon pulled thomas out
you don't remember your videos and you watch them more than we do
you really don't watch them properly else you'd know
