we wouldn't make construction engineers
oh
too small
make it a bit bigger

oh dear
oh no
open it
you're going to see if it's in there
that's a good idea
oh

perhaps her hair ribbon might be in there
to tie up her hair
oh
what's that
oh
is it her pants
excuse me
have you got no pants on
oh
she's got no pants on
her pants
put your pants on under your trousers

no
she hasn't got any shoes
we bought some doll's clothes for sophie that had shoes with them didn't we
yeah
do you remember
i don't think
you haven't got any shoes for your dolly have you
i don't think this is supposed to go over the top of that blouse
think she's going to look a bit bundled up
supposed to be this alright
oh
i think that might be a bit small for your baby
don't you
you haven't really got a smaller baby
lucy's the smallest one you've got isn't it
well
the only other one i can think of that one
we could see
oh
hang on
hang on
is it the wrong way round
it's because her head turns round anne
this peculiar dolly
oh
now
she looks in that doesn't she
wants her bibbie on does she
she hasn't got a coat
no
i know you have
for you or for dolly
for the dollys
oh right
you could put her hat on though
which one's gonna going to wear a hat
i think yours ought to because yours has got no hair has she
no
so she'll get a cold head
there
that's right
wow
she looks stunning now doesn't she
and which is gonna going to wear the bib
shall i see if i can find a ribbon for her hair
shall i look for one
let me see if i can find one
we might be able to find a decent ribbon
oh
there's a ribbon

anne
a bit muddled to have the doll's clothes and the animals
no

okay
i'm not going to take yours home
yes
i'm not going to take that
no
caroline's little girl could play with it if if she took it home couldn't she

i think that one might be in the wrong box anne
yeah
that one's in the wrong box
that one doesn't go with that one does it
what where do birds put their eggs
do you know
in a n
nest
can you see a nest
might not know what a nest looks like
there's a nest
that's it
where's the big nest
what
to go with the big egg
well
that big egg goes in another game
and i think it probably goes with an egg cup
in the other game
what about this teddy
that's an easy one isn't it
that happened to your dolly this morning didn't it
what happened
her arm came out
didn't it
yeah
in the bath
now
what do you think goes in that box
that's right
that puppet
it's called a jack in
not anne in
jack in
john collins
is that what you're thinking of
i thought you might
oh
what's that one
that lives with the cup
that's a good idea
what
oh
there
oh
you see if it goes with that one
um that's not an egg cup
that's a teacup
you don't know what an egg cup is do you
we don't have boiled eggs
i should leave that one out the way
because i don't think
i'll perhaps find the other game in a minute that that one goes in
yeah
you were doing the teapot one weren't you
what's that teapot lost
oh
that's right
needs a lid
what've you lost
it's here
it needs a saucer
that's another one that's a bit out of date
here
or a plate
it's a bit like a plate
oh
what do you think you need to go with that
and what's that
the toothpaste
that's right
think somebody's squeezed that toothpaste haven't they
oh
no
i don't think that you did
you need a lock to go with the key
that
oh
now that goes
that's a bow
and that goes with the violin i think
oh

who's that
cat
and what's that cat doing

shall we see
you're right
oh
what's happened to the teacher
she's fallen off her chair and her books have all gone up in the air
and her glasses have fallen off
haven't they
and her pen's leaking look
why do you think he doesn't want the wolf to hear him
what do you think the wolf might do
eat him up

what's his dad doing
riding on his bike

oh
there's one there
oh

thought he'd gone on his travels
gone on holiday
are they at the station
you know who else could go in this train don't you
your men could go couldn't they
hey
we could
i know
shall we have another train
i think mummy's getting carried away
yes
hang on
two trains
okay
to go on the railway
oh
here look
we could have this train
oh
that's a bit of it isn't it
here we are
oh
has it got to go
are they going into the station at the same time
oh my
is there room in the station
okay
oh
so the people have got to choose which train they're gonna going to get on haven't they
pardon
you want me to push that one
this one's going behind the men's house
choo
oh
this one's going to london
okay
i think this is london over here
the trouble is we've forgotten to bring any people with us
no people got on the trains did they
i'm going
my train's going back to get some people
pardon
oh dear
oh
is it broken near london
oh
okay
i think it's because the engine's a bit big
there you are
okay
oh fiddlesticks
yeah
that might help
that'll work better now
let's see
who's gonna going to get on my train
i think this red man's going in the back
um that red man's going inside
oh
you can have these ones
okay
i might have to be a bit selective because that one's got a bit of a circle bit
there
how's that
yeah
but he's too tall
that's why i've chosen one of those little ones
well
that one's too tall as well
choo
okay
i wonder which train's gonna going to get there first
go on then
you wouldn't be following me would you
i've got to london
oh
my people are getting off
your people aren't getting off
my people are
my train's going back over here
pardon
well
they're having a day out in london
they don't want to get on the train yet
the train'll come back for them later
i should think
we don't want to come on the train
oh
well
in a minute
i'm just drinking my tea
i know you are
what's happened
is there
where from
oh
oh
oh
put the other train on top of that train
thank you
whoops
wrong way round
what's the matter
is it because that bit's
oh
will that work
no
there we are
okay
okay
oh
that's a good idea
onto the train
under the tunnel
it's going under the tunnel anne
under the table
okay
yes
does this train need to go and park under there as well then
does it right
oh right
shows you how to do lots of different things doesn't it
yeah
okay
which one would you like to try and do
shall we do this funny duck
that bridge
that's the zoo isn't it
so
we need the green board don't we
and then
oh
that's right
okay
shall we do the bridge first
that bridge is all made with red bricks isn't it
well
one yellow brick on the top
there's one yellow brick
yes
the park one
did you
oh
it does look like an aeroplane
yeah
i think there's some fences across the middle
caroline's fences are red look
and the ones on there are blue
but that doesn't matter
oh yes
you're right
perhaps
oh
and there's some blue ones in there
yeah
i don't think there's another blue one
one more red one
oh
okay
um can i arrange your red bricks or have i got to leave those ones like that
okay
right
are you gonna going to find me some other ones then
okay
well
i don't need green ones do i i don't think for this
we need the tigers
we do need the tigers
okay
it's something like that anne
yeah
okay
that little yellow um little small tiger is sitting there look
steps
hang on
hang on
hang on
hang on
how's that
four steps
oh
okay
nobody
perhaps it was that big tiger
that's very good
now
the other side look
we need some yellow bricks
they're yellow bricks
yeah
no
i don't think so
can i move your aeroplane
oh
i think you've probably got enough yellow ones there
oh
because the yellow ones go like this look
yellow one goes like this
and then like this
and then we need
or will we need
and elephant on one side and a hippo on the other side
okay
that's lovely
can you find the hippo and the elephant
that's right
one on one side and one on the other
because i think they're in two different fields
can you get it on
okay
i see
so he can climb up
lots of yellow in the farm
in the zoo now isn't there
whoops
it's lovely
yes
right
over here anne
i think what we'd better have is
we'd better find some white bricks so that we can put the penguins on the white bricks
the white bricks are a bit like snow aren't they
or ice
and that's what penguins like
they like it when it's cold
just over here
that's it
little bricks and the big bricks
that's lovely
shall i look for the penguins
think they might like them piled up a bit
might they like them a little bit piled
that's it
with some blue bricks as well for the water
okay
there
oh
that's beautiful
shall i put the penguins on this bit then
one at the top
where's that one gonna going to go
oh
they like their house don't they
now
shall we build a tree for the monkey to sit in
what color bricks do we need for that
okay
could use these ones as well
pardon
have a colored tree
it keeps falling
are you cross with it
here
let's make give it a firm base
that might be a bit better
he just stands up doesn't he
right
that's his tree
you know what
the men that are in the train could come to the zoo now to look at the animals couldn't they
okay
think the whales would go in with the tigers
or do you think they'd go in with the penguins
okay
oh yes
shall i bring
are you gonna going to get the train or
okay
okay
let's get the zoo all ready and then you can take you can open the doors
you can unlock it and say it's open
can't you
when the zoo's all ready
okay
oh
is it gonna going to fall over
how's that
the trouble is the taller you make it the more likely it is to fall over really
okay
are you gonna going to drive the train
you're gonna going to open the doors
okay
he has hasn't he
it's because he's not tall enough
so he's sticking out the window
he's got his head out the window so he can see what's going on
here comes the train
can the people get off
is the zoo open
okay
is the driver gonna going to stay in the train
he's gonna going to get out is he
he's in the other driver now is he
whoops
are the other men gonna going to get out
oh
i thought they were all gonna going to get out to go and have a look at the animals in the zoo
are they
i was gonna going to say
i would wake them up
because they might not want to miss out on the zoo
oh
they've gone to see the animals
hey
come over here and look at the monkeys
okay then
okay
let's not forget they're there then
okay
okay
careful by the speaker anne
