that won't be enough
i think i still need more milk

don't you have another truck
thank you
that's still not enough
adam will you say one two three four
you say it
oh yes
that's alright
something's sticking out on the tape recorder
what d you think it is
do you have a harvard shirt on
what
oh the dresser is hurting your head
why are you putting your head on the dresser
does it still hurt you
it what
adam maybe you can use these
you have some
where
what colors d you have
red and blue
anything else
well it'd be nicer to leave the box there and just take them out of the box
if you leave the box there then we'll know where it is
alright
would you get your handkerchief please
what did you see on television last night
did it have a lion in it
did it have a scarecrow in it
did it have a wizard in it
that's right
can you
i don't think so
it's glued on there isn't it
d you know why those people wanted to go see the wizard
you don't know
you don't know why
they each wanted the wizard to do something
d you know what the lion wanted
handle it very gently
you can open one end
yes you open it
now let's see
the stick
attach rubber
we have to attach it to this little hook
i'm taking out the tail part
i think you can take this piece out too
really
alright adam
take this piece off very carefully
these we put into here
these are wings and we're putting them into the clip
no
this is the wing
and another wing
i'm taking the end off
then they can attach by themselves
we're putting this clip onto the stick so it will go like an airplane
it's not easy
no it's not so easy
oh i see it did
now you turn the propeller many times
okay let's try it
you try it
now hold it up in the air and let go
it's a sky dart
the same way you put it together
oh no
why don't you leave it together
oh a bit more
a sky dart
paul adam's talking to you
do it more until it's tight
no it doesn't have wheels
sometimes
well it's not a regular airplane
it's what you call a sky dart
that's why the wings aren't straight
see paul
thank you
he didn't give me anything
i took some paper from him
i took it from him
the tail
the rudder
no
which part don't you like
alright
you can have it straight
wind it many times
that makes it fly
that's right
well don't hold the rubber band
because then you keep it from turning
no
no no don't let paul get it
that's right
well he likes it but he doesn't know how to handle it carefully
you aren't holding the rubber band are you
it turns too
see how the band is being twisted
the wings don't turn do they
what are those
i thought you said that was a propeller
no it was right but it fell on its tail
on a caboose
what kind of caboose
you need to hold it up like this
thank you
i guess when it hits the floor it hits so hard that it falls off
i heard it
that's the place to attach the dart to the propeller
no
why
it thought your arm was a tree
why did it think that
you didn't hold it up high enough
first you wind it many times
then you hold it here and here and let go
paul wouldn't know what to do with an airplane
i don't think i would adam because it's not very strong
you won't cut your finger what
oh yes when it snaps
that's a strong rubber band
oh did it break
not in that but people get in real airplanes don't they
it doesn't fly all by itself
you help it by turning the propeller
i just don't think that paul is interested
where
are there any children
oh
you made it
who made it
oh you made one
a little boy named george
and he had a sister named what
no tony was the little baby
his sister's name was what
the little girl
her name is sheila
sheila
careful adam you may break your airplane
your sky dart
the what
you don't
well are you being very very careful with it
it fell on that on that part adam
those are bright tone crayons
careful
pick the one you dropped on the floor up
what d you think that is
they're all black
i'm asking you
no they aren't all black
yes i think that's black
no the paper is
some of the paper is black
but that's yellow
the yellow black thing
i don't know why the black should be on the yellow
all the others have their own color
maybe they made a mis
oh honey
yes you made a mistake
no adam
careful honey
fell went over you
what are you going to do with it
oh adam
an airplane fell on your little brother
adam
adam
did you make another mistake
you're pushing paul
will you take those and put them back in the crayon box so they won't get broken
yes
why would you want to break them
you don't like crayons
you think that is meat
what kind of meat
you made two of that adam
because you took them out
that has two ends and evidently you opened both of them now where are the other crayons

use your hammer and take it out
now you can drill right through there
you can screw that on
where's your screwdriver

well how would you turn it
careful
you ran over a bean bag

what is the horse killing
why
oh what is it you're killing
no
yes but what is it supposed to be
to kill the noise
you mean stop the noise
because that's the way it's made
that's a saddle isn't it

adam is playing with the airplane
oh why is it doing that
oh that's not an accident
how does an airplane come down
does it come straight down
he drives
why does he do that
drive
because it doesn't have a motor
i don't really know where a motor is on an airplane
why don't you ask ursula
perhaps she knows
this is the landing wheel
after you get up in the air it fold back
because it has a motor and it has a pilot to drive it
i guess it's misplaced
it must be lost
no in robin's home
what doesn't move
what's the matter paulie
oh no i don't think you should throw it
oh no i don't think you're supposed to do that
it's not a real airplane
why do i put my hand on it
i don't know
it's just not in here
it's just lost
then wind it up again
why can't you
how can a what
get an airplane when its up in the sky
well it can't because a bulldozer doesn't what
what does an airplane do

you know
a bulldozer doesn't fly
it doesn't have any wings
adam why don't you want to do this yourself
no no don't do that
you may break it and it's paul's
i don't know
it's going to do what

but it's falling
now why is it falling
when you turn the corner what happens

you hit his finger
no you didn't
i think you hit his finger
don't do that anymore
yes
i don't think so
he's giving you the other one
he didn't really knock it down
because the knots came out
because the knots in the string came out
i tied some knots in the string and they came out
why are you tying it
no i don't really think so
wait
don't run over paul
block
there are lots of blocks in the basket

won't you please go get it
alright
i'm sorry
i was just happy because you were doing such a good job
d you want to tell ursula about the museum you went to the other day
what museum was it adam
he said a toaster
oh you saw the toaster oh yes
can you tell her which museum it was
was it science museum
or the museum of fine arts
or the children's museum
what else did you see
a snake
birds
a real bird
did you see some birds that weren't real
what kind of birds were they
you don't remember
adam does it work with that little bow too
oh it's my turn
yes
it works
it what
what d you think
at the same time
well how are you going to do that
does that look like a macaroni adam
that looks like an elbow doesn't it
where're the peppers
what's a pepper
what d you think that is
why don't you look further inside the bag and see what you find
i don't know what d you think that is
well why don't you save that for a little while
oh i think you can
you just have to get the paper off
go ahead
you're getting it
that's right
what happened
d you have four there adam
how many d you have
he's not gonna what
oh that's a good idea
each one
which one goes the farthest
which one goes the farthest
and did they have a race adam
let's put them all in one place to start
did they roll
who won
oh how could they all win
oh
what d you have to do to win
what is that adam
adam what about these cars
aren't these like the cars that harvey had
why don't you do one thing at a time
oh
what kind of airplane
i didn't know that airplanes had a horn
you said beep beep
who
what's a full house
careful don't break it
does it turn now
no the wheel
what
it turns when it's getting ready to go up in the sky
why did you take my racers
this is green
green like the green light
what does this mean
how could an airplane go through a tunnel
how could it
i don't think it could go under it easily or through it
what should we say adam
do we go under a tunnel or do we go through a tunnel
adam if we put this here and we all start racing who wins the race
how does your car win
alright let's try
and who's the winner
yours what
what happens when he has a flat tire
can he keep on driving or does he have to stop
he can
with a flat tire
adam did you tell her about your accident
what happened
you caught your toe
no you didn't cut your finger
how did you catch
yes last year
but what happened to your toe
no it got caught in what
his tricycle
was it very bad
it wasn't
we had to use the pliers
no you couldn't
well we can play a guessing game
alright
let's play it
i don't think that's a car
what d you think it is not
you don't think that's a truck
well i don't think that's a bow
no
i think it might be something that flies in the air
i don't think it's an airplane
a spear
no i don't think it's a spear either
what else can fly in the air
a bird
it doesn't have any wings
maybe
you have to do something to it first
i think perhaps you'll have to put it together in some way
first you have to find out what it is
you might not like it
let's think a little while
you don't know
i still think something that flies in the air and maybe you hold on to it with a string
i think so
you mean unwrap
she might have that for robin
don't you think robin needs a kite
put it down
you play with something else a minute while i get paul up
i think you might need some help with that
so the short wouldn't come out
what's a short
what
what are you going to eat on that kite adam
hi paul
hi sleepy head
oh you're not a sleepy head now
i think it will
alright
that's the first part
then you have to take it outside on a windy day
there isn't much wind at all
perhaps tomorrow
no that's a string for what
why d you need string
watch the little cars
you can't
oh you can
let's see if you can
he has a flat tire
oh he didn't have a flat tire
what happens when you win
probably
careful adam
then what're you going to do with it
when you use that adam always shoot it away from people
oh no
i think daddy won't come in again
why would you shoot indians
i see you've learned how to use it adam
crawl under the bed
why not
it's dark under there
oh don't do that
now shoot over toward paul's bed
no because he's not in there sleeping
where did that go
what happened
okay
over that way further
see if you can hit the pillow in paul's bed
you missed
what happened that time
turn it the other way
yes
you what
what did you say
you almost did it
oh no
come back over here because you may hit me
paul what are you reading
a book
are you reading a book
oh very good
almost made a spear
oh is a spear like an arrow

what is that d you think
the mountains
they're watching a puppet show
these are puppets
these kangaroos are in there
that's a dragon
what d you think
i don't know
who
no here's his face
then they couldn't see
now it's night time
they have to go back
first they go for a boat ride
here're the boats
oh this side yeah
this is the fair and this is where they live
that's a good idea isn't it
but they could walk across the bridge
now were you going to find me a scissors
you read that one to me if you like
well that's what i need the scissors for
we can make very nice designs with it if we cut some paper to go on it
scissors
we have to have scissors to cut it out
really
how d you know that's the kind he likes
let's use this one
we need a circle just that size
a circle just that size
thank you
i'll trim it just a bit
that's very nice
yes it's sort of an egg shape
now adam let's start i cut this way
you turn this
i'll hold this down
you turn it
whoops not too fast
you can turn it over and do a different one
yes
lots of different things
not too fast
a head of a turtle
now you can set this in different places and see what it does
each time you move it it gets a different design
i don't think it'll write your name but it'll make lots of different designs
alright try
what
until this writes your name
it might do something surprising
let's make another piece of paper alright
alright
it's a little bit too big
make it a tiny bit smaller
you like that
no i'll think i'll bring it back
let's make it a tiny bit smaller
that's right
now it's just exactly right
it looks like a big flower
yes
another turtle
no more
not too fast
you need to go slower with it
isn't that pretty
that's enough
okay wait adam
that's right
i think so
let's try it
it's a surprise
not too fast adam because it doesn't work
is that a turtle
no
what is it
the pen
that's what makes it draw

oh is that alright
what happened
oh that's a good one adam
no just one
shall we trim it just a little bit
alright

alright
remember to go very slow when you're turning
so you can get a turtle in the middle
now you can change it
silly
i didn't think you were calling anyone silly were you
that's what i thought
try it like that
that
that makes it wavy
it makes it wavy like on the ocean
alright
alright
it's hard to hole it isn't it
sure
i could draw around it
would that make it any easier
and you could cut on the line
that's good
yes
it's pretty good
which way

where's the box

they're cotton balls
for cleaning things
if you have a hurt or scratch or cut you can clean it with a ball of cotton

can you find another piece like this adam
are there any more big ones
let him have some of the little ones adam
you can have some too
you use these
put some little ones in between and then it stays better
yes now you can put another long piece on
yes
careful it doesn't fall down
now you do the other side
why is it naughty
he can take some
no he's not
looks like a what
that's a rooftop
here diandra
let's give him a few more
let's see if we can't make it stand up
i guess that one's too small let's put a bigger one on
did you go to school today
with who
you want to put that one on
what's the matter
your shoe is untied
good and then you can put a roof on
oh yes
what're you doing
that looks high enough adam
are they both the same so you can put a roof on
i think this needs to be one higher
no diandra you use those
carefully
very carefully
what're you going to do with them
maybe you could make a floor
look at your building and see
oh we should make some steps
that's a good idea
it wouldn't be so hard to make steps
what
oh yes
you could have an open house and walk in
then you don't need doors and windows but you do need steps
i don't think so
now where we live
what
maybe this house is way out in the country
are you going to have any furniture in the house
furniture
who is going to sleep in the beds
me
i'm too big
alright
adam d you know what he's saying
not higher than the roof
how could you sleep higher than the roof
i thought we're pretending i'm small
it's a bunk bed
is everything alright
i'm going upstairs because paul really is very cranky this afternoon alright
you di make a gate
a fence
you need two straight pieces
and a lot little pieces
i think they have to be the double kind
the fat kind
like that
that's a good idea
we'll do that next
right on top
oh that looks good
shall we make a fence all around the house
okay
now you'll be safe
why don't move that over because that might not go over the
the fence
thank you
isn't that a pretty fence
okay
we'll fix that adam that's not too hard to fix
not too hard
here
a mouse
a mouse can't eat me
i'll eat the mouse
it is not
did you see any pictures of the circus
have you been to the circus
now we need one more side
oh that's so pretty adam
now you could fix up the house again and put the roof on
it doesn't need a floor
does it need a roof
maybe it doesn't
yes that's right and that could be the water
you can pretend
make another one and we'll have a race
alright
the boat knocked down a house
let's put everything back first
will you help diandra
i didn't bring the top
i have my car just outside
it doesn't take very long to get from here to the car
yes it does
it takes very long from harvard
that's where you used to live
i live near there
i'm in the same place
is that yours
does diandra have one too
apple mommy
did you finish yours already

alright
then maybe diandra can play with it next
why don't you let diandra play with the windmill and we'll put this together
diandra's your mother
alright
be very careful
submarine

alright
maybe it's a jet
yes

but this is peace time
peace time means there's no war
yes
make it go high
let's see if there's something else to do on it
good for you diandra
this makes it fly straight i think
oh that's good

i could make one for every finger if you want
one more
oh one for me
were you at school
of course

i guess i made it too small
that's very nice adam
that's a beautiful bow
look at those colors
here's your bow
i don't think i do do you
a bigger one no i don't
how
what's the difference between a spear and an arrow
what about the arrow
that's a very funny thing
you could hang it from the ceiling
shall i make you a necklace
a gun
i certainly don't
that's a bicycle
a big truck
me too
sounds like a motor to me
what would a lion be doing on your street
i would care
i wouldn't mind if a monkey wakes me up
if a what
car
oh
yes i don't like a clock to wake me up but i don't mind monkeys and i don't mind a kitty
does your puppy wake you up
you would
i'll take them off
we can make some flowers
in your yard
did you plant them
can i see them from here
i'll see them when i go out
no not like this one
i just made this one up
you want to make some too
oh is that your
i'm sorry
i didn't mean to take that
d you go to school all day
in the morning too
i thought maybe you go in the morning and stay and have lunch there
is that how it goes
does kris go home too
it's a funny flower
isn't it
here's another one
what happened to my flowers
oh no she's here
she's upstairs talking to somebody
must be a gun
me too
oh yes
then we have to make a sprinkling can
oh yes i can
alright
let's see first how big your wrist is
here's one
no
well i can make
no
no i can make a hammer and a chair
wait a minute
i have to put this on you
let's try
you have to ask me when you want it off
you're just going to keep it on
alright
here's your watch
now it can't pinch you
what time is it
eight thirty
that's it right there
aren't you going to keep them on
i'm going to keep mine on
it comes off
you look very elegant
let's put them away
i'm going to keep my ring on too
let's leave the flowers up alright
are there some books in there
d you want to look at them
what're you going to do with the pajamas
what does it look like
a banjo
let's see where it's going to fit
doesn't your mother have one of these
guess
no
guess again
i guess this is going to fit here
try again
we're going to need some crackers and a bowl
d you want to ask your mother for that
a small bowl
let's put the crackers on here and the bowl goes here
put a cracker in here and turn it and see what happens
what did it make
it's a grinder
it grinds them up
lots of what
you can watch it come out here
cracker crumbs
you could put them back through again
a what
a grain thrower
yes or else you could ask your mother if there is anything else she wants ground up
it comes out like a waterfall
i think maybe that's the last time
watch your fingers
what did you say sugar
yes that's the one
sure and sheep too
go slow
grain fall
i think maybe that's enough
they do
they taste salty and delicious
brush yourself off
let's see if we can rescue some of this alright
that means you can grind this up again
that's a good idea
we'll just pick it up with the paper
look inside and see how you think it works
where does it push it
what way
where does the grain go when you push it
and then
you could make some bread with that
you make bread out of grain
oh let's take a bigger piece
no
careful
you forgot something
it'll taste like roast beef
chicken
what does yours taste like
chocolate
let's make a little funnel
pour it right in
cheese
grapes
careful
watch
well look what happens here
what d you think this does when you put a cracker through there
what d you think it does here
how come it gets so small
what d you think it will be like
orange juice
wait adam
now don't forget to put the bowl back
frost
what's it like
there isn't any
stand up and we'll clean it all off again
alright but first i have to get it all collected
wait for me
don't go without me
it's all gone
alright
water
mine tastes like pepsi cola
raspberries
it changes grain into anything you want right
can you make me some strawberries
why d you have to wait till it gets older
what kind of things do you eat that are older
water's older
that's right
only it gets less every time
oh that's alright
you can
we can use the flower
who's coming down
with the what
what did you call it
the grain what
alright
well let's leave it up alright
i don't know if i have anything else
maybe you'll have to show me some things alright
what d you think
you better put those back
the pajamas aren't to play with
guess
what d you think
maybe
i do
cherries
maybe i could have a drink but i can't stay for supper
no
why not
we forgot to show your mother the rings
yes
alright
well i'll take one and you take two how's that
what did we forget
oh
yes
shall i get out the pipe cleaners
yes
it would grind the stick up
yeah but then you couldn't eat the grain anymore
that's right because it'll be mixed with stick
a telescope
i'll try
no thank you
that's a good idea
you make a chain
a chain of flowers
yes it's very old
old glasses
shall we do that after the telescope
why don't you bake some bread
here's your telescope
here diandra
yes
i'm making them
oh thank you
i'm sorry
that i didn't bring you down anything to eat
well we had all those fruits strawberries and cherries remember
oh my goodness
now i don't have to get any birthday presents
you do
what time is it
oh yes what shall i do with it
oh it's good
no thank you
if you want to but i don't want any more
what d you think that was
maybe it was a police car
how d you know how cows eat
how d you know how cows eat
no thank you
say no thank you
adam
just a minute
where shall we put this
you had something to eat
did you tell her what you had in there
buds
oh it's a rosebud i guess
yes
would he be taller than you if you trade chairs
just a minute
alright
would you like to bring your chair over here
have you told her that you're graduating from nursery school
his robe
who made the hats
oh i didn't even know i was supposed to make your hat
out of cardboard
well i saw them in her office when i took the robe in
let's take the biggest thing first
oh is that the way you know that's rubber
that was very nice of you adam
i wouldn't be so sure
let me open it
is there a trick to opening this
good
try it on paper
does it work
it's the stamp pad
we may have to put another drop of ink on there
maybe a drop of water would do
just one drop adam
what
one fill
you don't need much so you
it won't work if you put too much on there
one more drop
what is that
maybe we have to use paint
it's too wet isn't it
that must be paper to print on
you can see the outline of it
you could print it right in the book
yes it is isn't it
yes you can even take them apart and print them
one what
are those letters or numbers
can you spell your name
diandra he asked you not to touch them
stop draw
stop draw
alright draw stop
stop draw
stop draw
your name is draw
diandra don't say stupid
that's not nice to say
he said what
well what does that mean
i didn't hear you say thank you
a monster magnet
it does doesn't it
why d you think it sticks
it's the most what
oh it's glue
is that why it's sticking
it's not a magnet after all
it's not
it's not coming out
i don't think it really needs water
it probably needs a little more ink in the pan
no no this probably needs some more ink
pen ink
stamp ink
that's not really ink
that's the water that's mixed in with ink
no i don't think you need water dear
on the pad yes
adam why don't you let them play with it
come on boys let's go upstairs
i don't want a cat
i've got a dog
i don't want to have a dog
my dog is outside
these are mexican jumping beans
he can help too
it's right underneath the ink
no i guess not
isn't that nice adam
very good adam
can you tie your shoes
look in the bag
i can feel mine jump when i hold mine in my hand
what
yes i see
without what
my arm is too big
let me put it on you
how can you get out
some more
you haven't finished playing with these
are you sure you want something else
alright
what did you find adam
now adam you better find yourself a a target
you could use this for a target
it's a dart
aim for the target
dart
somebody what
you missed
i never what
won't get it
be careful
i have an idea what you said
i won't tell you
it's a secret
you missed the target
no
you almost got it
what're you doing that for
are you his admirer
why don't you take that one out
you only had two
here it is on the chair
is that it on the chair
what
shoot at yourself
i wouldn't do that
that could be dangerous
no don't point it toward anyone
why don't you do it over here
hit on the black
almost
two more darts
well no
let's look at your gun
careful adam
yes
alright
important to who
why don't you stick to one thing
only the one thing yes
that's right
she wants so much toys
what will i play with when i go home
alright
you have to take care of what
to do what
stand up
what're you supposed to be
well let's let paul keep one
d you have one diandra
yes
just like a target shall be
is that what you said
you're aiming some place
a mexican day
yes he can keep it
that's right
what
what's wrong paul
why
a what
no what could you put the cans on
a record phone
you mean the record player
maybe i can help you fasten it
i don't think so
no just on the door
no dear on the door
it's easier for mommy to keep up with with the door
let's have the door for the special place for the darts
that's the what
who makes the rodger gun
you only call it what
a rodger gun
i don't feel like reaching way up there
am i that tall
am i that tall
mommy
mommy
see
are you going to be tall enough
promise not to do it again
i still can't reach it
i'm afraid that won't be sufficient
did it
good
it's not up there by glue
no
she said no just like i said no
no
it works like a plunger
no it's not a magnet
why d you think it sticks
that's not the reason
see if you can find out why
it's not glue
it has air
i surely don't
what d you think happens when i push down
yes just like a plunger that's right
when you push down it pushes out the air underneath there
maybe he could keep two
can you tell me what makes that stick
i don't talk to you like that
it wouldn't stick would it
why
the what
the dodge
what is the dodge
just a minute ago you were saying it was some other kind of a gun a rodger gun
i don't know that i've heard of anybody with rodger as a last name
you didn't hit her
are you sure
what
that's his nursery school teacher
how many do you have
get on the other side honey
you get on this side diandra
close the door diandra
a mule
that's what the expression is
it's something you say to
yes you say it to a person to help explain something or add color to what you're saying
you could shoot at anything that's set up for a target
oh is that why you missed
alright now
again
again
just right
thank you
don't play what yet
you say no
why not
why not
yes
i'm going upstairs and check on paul

all the other ones should be higher than that
a racing car
where is it
oh i see
but you went away for awhile didn't you
d you want to tell me
no you didn't tell me anything about it
for the sound
maybe the hole is for the sound to come out
that shows where to put your fingers
do you think you're finished with the banjo
do you know what they are
those aren't cigarettes
that's right
i brought you that from switzerland

i don't think it will close if you put too many
yes
did you learn them in school

i wonder what happens if you mix these two
what d you think it will make

with a clock on it
how much do they cost
what time does the clock say
okay
ten cents five cents and one cent
you could just stand it up
there's a bunch of grapes
they'll last a long time
if you only give him two every day
maybe he'd like an apple too
do you
no i like this one thank you
that's right
a what
a carrot of course

oh
i have quite a ways to go
alright
that's not a banjo that's a guitar
paul
oh what is it now

that's just the case it came in
don't put your mouth on it
he'd have to have one too
or something so he could hear you
i don't think so
you can go from one end of the street to the other
go from one end of the street to the other
okay don't play with it adam
you may break it
well maybe when you get a little bigger
david's eleven years old
