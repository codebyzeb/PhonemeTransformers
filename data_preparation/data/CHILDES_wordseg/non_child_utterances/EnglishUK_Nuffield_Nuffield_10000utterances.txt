you like this one don't you
how to hide a lion
one hot day a lion strolled into a market square to buy a hat
but the towns people were scared of lions so he ran away
he ran as fast and as far as he could and hid in a house in a garden
it was a playhouse and it belonged to a small girl called iris
you can't hide there said iris who wasn't scared of lions
that house is too small for you
so they went inside so iris could hide the lion properly
they had to be quiet because mums and dads can be funny about having a lion in the house
the lion let iris pull the leaves out of his mane and he showed her his paw where he'd stepped on something sharp
i'll put a plaster on that said iris
it wasn't easy hiding a lion
it was just too big
too fluffy
and too heavy
especially when he was asleep
lions sleep alot
and when nobody was looking the lion would come out to play yay jump
look at him jumping on the bed
they just had to be careful not to be too noisy
one evening iris's dad said they still haven't found that lion
i bet it's a kind lion said iris from behind the sofa
there's no such thing as a kind lion said her mum
all lions will eat you
the lion was worried but iris comforted him
then she said him his favourite story it was about a tiger who came to tea
he fell asleep half way through because lions
lions sleep alot
and that was how everything went wrong
ahhah
iris heard her mum coming up the stairs but it's hard to wake a sleeping lion
however most lions wake up when their mums scream at them
ah
the lion raced out of the house
ahhah tearing down the street
found a hiding place where he could still see iris whenever she came into town
nobody noticed him
not the town's people
not even iris
certainly not the two burglars who broke into the town hall and stole every single one of the lord mayor's candlesticks
