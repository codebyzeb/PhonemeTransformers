what's that for
no what does it do for the fireplace
i think it's broken honey
do you know why it's there
to protect you
that's a screen she's talking about
so the fire won't come out
so the logs won't roll out on the floor
that's why the screen's there
the screen
well that's supposed to open it but it's broken
yeah
so you can put more logs in and clean it out when it needs to be cleaned
i don't know
it's probably the way it came

too girls or boys
there's one boy and one girl on the inside and one boy and one girl on the outside
why's he going up on the roof
but why did he go up in the first place
the roof wasn't wide enough
was he scared
then why did he come down
it was what
i see
he went up and fixed it
it's easy to stand the cow up
it's pretty easy to stand the cow up
what
you didn't stand it up
you said you could stand up the baby cow but you didn't let it stand up
it fell down
what is it
oh
oh
well then why don't you put it over there
on top of the newspaper so it will be out of the way
a chicken
a chicken
it's not
oh
i was just kidding you
then come here
come come here and sit down a minute
and take a rest
right here
are you are you getting so so tired you're getting silly
would you like to read a story
if you want to go and get one of your books we can read a story
and you take a rest while we read read the story
how about right here
for who
for mommy
that's for the kitchen isn't it
in the kitchen
she just went to the bath
i was just putting some plates away
where did you where did the kitchen go over here
oh just so it would be in the middle
it does make noise when you get too close to it
okay
that's the bed and that's the kitchen
oh wait a minute
i thought you put the refrigerator over there
how can that be the kitchen if this
okay
now it's that's going to be the kitchen huh
that can be one bed and that
this is a bed over here in this corner
did that scrape
did that scrape
i hit it scraped
let's see
is it going to turn red
oh i think it's alright
i thought it could go in the kitchen
i think that goes in the kitchen for the kitchen table
no it's the seat for the kitchen table
it could go besides it's a bench for the kitchen table
okay
that little tiny room is the living room
well i think that the smallest room ought to be the bath
is it in the bag
that's where all the furniture is as far as i know
is it empty
maybe we didn't bring the toilet then
i guess we didn't bring it
where does what belong
the wrench
it's the wrong way
the what out
um
i don't think that comes out
i just don't think it does
i think it's part of it's attached to the rest of the body of the car
i think only the sides come off
i think you're going the wrong way though
it's making it tighter
do you want to take it off or put it on
well
what do you want to do
do you want to take it off
that way
okay
yeah
i think i can help you a little bit maybe
nope
there
yes it does
the hood comes off
i think it can
nope
it's stuck
you're going the wrong way
that's right
nope
that's right
maybe you need to use the screwdriver
yeah
now ya can't drive it all
no
there's no wheels and there's no steering wheel
and
there's still a motor
there's still an engine
use the wrench
what
what
nope
now you can't drive at all
well you tell me
there's no engine and no steering wheel
you're the right person
why are you the right person to do it
why
you are
it doesn't come out
is jenni the right person
is jenni the right person to do that too
why not
oh
she doesn't listen to you
oh
oh you're right
where did that come from
found the blue block
oh good
i'm so glad
wonder where it was
oh
maybe it was in the car or something
or maybe it was under the tractor
maybe so
no you didn't
you didn't lift it up
it was just sitting right there
oh you have a hole in both socks
oh
do you have a hole in both socks
who's going to put the car back together
who
who's going to put it back together
no
we're not leaving
i just wondered if you knew how to put it back together
because when you were little you didn't know how
can you do it now
who
can you
i still see something else
and i don't hear it but i see it
is it under
have another bolt
and another one
is that it
i don't hear anything
i think you took it all apart
do you need help
oh
okay
good
that's a cute question
i don't know
i think it goes in on the spare tire
i think so
that goes on the engine
that goes on the steering wheel
that's not going to work
screw
i think you have to have a bolt on the back of it
no you don't
no you don't on this one
maybe lois will play with the steering wheel while you turn the screw
okay you turn the screw
the other way
the other way
whoop
nope
let's try it again
yeah
that's it
there
can or can't
that's the engine
no
goes on the um
in the front
no
oh i'm sorry
that goes in the back
the engine goes in the front
no
that's right
nah that's not right
the engine just goes right here
doesn't have a wheel
this is the engine
no
you saw a wheel in the back
that's it
good
can i ask a question
okay we have to write them after every step
what
after every step
you need a red screw pete
yeah
yeah
that yellow one's too small
the other way
you can use a screwdriver if you want to make it tight
now it's tight
now it's tight
that goes where it was
yes
yes
um
i think the tools go on the back
i think this goes in the back
i think so
the jack
i don't know
here it is
here it is
well i guess you need the wooden sides on first i think
i think so
put the hood on
yeah
you have to put the hood on
here before you put the sides on
here it is
that's right
you want me to hold the car
that's the wrong side
patsy said that's the wrong side
no we need the other one
this is a hard job isn't it
um no
that one goes right there i think
should we put a blue bolt in here too
let's put the bolt in first
okay
you have to make these things fit those things in the holes i think
yeah
there you go
now you can screw it in
now you can screw it
there you go
now you can screw it in
now you can screw it
right here
okay
that's good
yeah
nice and tight
so okay
now if you put the other wooden side on you can put the wheels on
we have to get this in the holes
okay
there
alright
the yellow screw
the blue bolt on the yellow screw
i don't see one yellow screw
good for you
not talking about lumps here's a blue bolt
where's the yellow screw
do you see
oh it's behind you peter
there it is right there
we have to fit the blue
wait a minute
take the screw out
have to put the bolt on first
okay
that's probably tight enough
little bit more
okay
very good
it's nice and tight now
now there's the wheels and the headlights
okay
put the little bolt inside
wait peter
we have to put a bolt in first
okay
whoops
oh i pulled my hair a little bit but it's alright
it didn't hurt very much
looking at the screw to see if it goes in the bolt okay and i don't think it does
i think i have a bolt that's too small
i do okay
can you take the screw out again
i'm sorry
i made a mistake
okay
now it should be okay
it's working
that's a good idea
oh you did a good job so far
it's a lot work
i didn't know you knew how to put it back together
why does it have tools
so that you can fix the
so that you can take it apart and put it back together
if you didn't have the tools you couldn't unscrew the wheels if you didn't have a screwdriver
if you have a jack it's easier to change the tires
you can take the bolts out
it would be very hard to do it if you didn't have on of those
i think you probably could do it but it would hurt
you could put the rest of the wheels on
i don't know
what is that
a little car
i don't know
is this a tool
is this a tool
is this a tool
you want me to help you
should we put a tire on
okay
you give that
that's a bolt
okay
you look and watch the screw come through
is it coming through yet
okay
okay
should we put another one on now
this one
i see the screw coming through
okay
got one more huh
i need another bolt though another yellow bolt
yeah
the screw coming through
okay
i see it coming through
good
now i think we're missing the headlights
right here
no
that's the windshield
it's supposed to be a window
it's pretend window
those are the headlights and the taillights
the other one is behind you
you have to put the screws in to make it look like headlights though
i think it's a combination of the headlights and bumper i guess
do you think we have to put some bolts in or not
yeah
we have to open the trunk
oh there is a yellow one in there already
i don't think the blue goes there
that's right
i'll hold this on for you if you want and you put the screw in
no no that's not gonna work
right
i'm sure we have to push it from the back
yeah
how about this uh taillight
it already has a bolt
that's right
here's your screw
there's another blue screw behind you
let's see now
it's almost done
i'm very surprised that you could do the whole thing
when you were a little bitty boy when you were just a little boy
you couldn't put the car back together
did you know that
you need to put a bolt in first
it was just
here it is
time out
you have to put the bolt in
i see it coming maybe it's under your valentine
there it is
i see it coming
see
here it is
whew
very good
that was good
all finished
congratulations
you win first prize
well i don't think we brought the other barrels
what do you mean
do you want to fix up all the rooms
okay
what what kind of things
we didn't bring all the furniture because we had to come so far
you know we had to come a long way today
so we didn't bring all the furniture
we can make we can fix each room
we had so far to come that's why we didn't bring you then
but we can fix up each room a little bit
maybe the next time we come but we won't be coming tomorrow
we just are going to come one time this time instead of two times
it's so far
it's a long trip
i know but
well we have to come on the bus
before we used to just walk to your house from school
we live in new york and you still we still live in new york and you live in new jersey
we have to go all the way back to where your daddy works
oh it's much too far
yeah
it's about an hour
it takes about an hour
that's right
and then we can walk to our house from there
okay
let's see
we could make this the living room
the whole family in the living room
and we could put this in the living room
this bench
and maybe we could put one of these chests in the living room too
and we could even take some of the furniture from that house and put it in this on
we could get the table and put it in here
there's only one table
you know we could get that round one in there and there'd be two tables
why don't you put that one in this room
so there'll be one in each room instead of having all in the same room
not big enough
okay
oh not too long
well pretty soon we have to go home
i have to go and see my lucy
you know my i have to go see my baby too
she'll be hungry and want somebody to be home
well i was going to put these in the house
no

or some kind of tape that that wrap around here then then you wouldn't have the two different levels
there
this isn't scotch
it's really dumb
well let's see
that's just uh
we just have well
this is really strong tape but
you want to hold that like that and we'll make a try
it's hard to cut
yeah
it's really tough stuff
it's very hard to hold without the tabs on it
it slips
it slides
oops
let me hold this so i can slide and do the other side
i don't know whether to do it down there or up here
do it around like that yeah
i tell you
it looks like i'm going to use all of it
