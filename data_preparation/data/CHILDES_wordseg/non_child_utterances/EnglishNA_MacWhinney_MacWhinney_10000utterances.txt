ross took his bath
m
and he threw doo all over the floor
m
and when i walked in i saw it
doo doo
uh ca
poo poo
uh poo excuse me
and um
i walked in and saw it
and i said
oh my
and ross looked at me and he said
oh my
and then he said
how did he say it
let's hear how he said it
oh he mushed it
oh my
he said oh no
oh my
the goodness was mushed but the oh was clear
oh my
and then he said
oh my
oh my
was that clear
it was pretty clear considering i i understood
oh my
and i was sort of listening
yeah
and then he said
oh wow
oh wow
i was trying to figure out what that one was but that was clear too
it was clear enough
he doesn't say anything clear
just now
he says don't very clearly
no he doesn't
he says unt
he says du
don
well he doesn't say it clearly though
he doesn't say don't
pretty clear
okay
and then and then just a few minutes ago i gave him a piece of coconut which he had been pointing at and wanting
and so i gave it to him
and he said thank you
thank you
mary wants to tell us a story about mike spratt
i think he means mine
mine
mine
okay
you want to tell us a story about mike spratt now mary
please
oh
mike spratt came over
and as soon ross realized that uh i'm not sure this is such a good story
tell it
huh
as soon mike re ross realized that mike was there he began to bring him the uh leggo dolls
one by one
and then he became uh began became involved in a game with mike
where mike would um this was very nonverbal
ross would put the doll oh i know he wanted all the doll back from mike that was it
after he gave them all to him
so he'd take them one by one
well at least he took the first one and then he'd put it on the window sill
then he asked mike for the next one and mike gave it to him
and he asked mike for the third one but mike would not give him the third one until ross put the second one on the window also
uh and he tried i guess mike guided his hand that time
so the third and fourth time around ross got the hang of the game
so when people insist on him doing things he will do things
yeah he got the game very very quickly

what was that
was that navajo honey

something like mommy
he's has never used uppy to ask for food

mostly for food now and or then also very rare
and he uses uppy for any type of action in which he's being propelled by another person through the air
transfer
transferred
transferred from one place to another
but particularly he uses it to get into the house even when he kind of helps himself in

yes
with the bell
and he was putting the wheels end of the toy
up onto the window
and he was saying uppy for that
so he was propelling it
he'd say uppy and he was propelling it
and then of course every
time that the bell would fail the little toy would fail
he it would fall down off the ledge and he would
try it again
slam it against the floor
bang it up and down on stamp it on the floor
yeah
and say
no no no no no

mary
mommy
mommy
yeah
are you questioning
or you just playing a game
you want to do 
you want to do 
ross just said keys a second ago
keys
keys honey
keese keys
he said keese keys
keys
keys
you can say our keys
oh boy
uppy
opa
uppy
no keys
keys ross
keys
no
he seems to like the idea of one single gesture
let's see
some other word he was saying you could just see where he had gotten the intonation but that was about all
he got the whole feel of the word
but he didn't have little details very good
he had the contour really
the intonational contour of it
oh
but keys
like keese keys
you've got the rising contour and uh
i don't know what else
the aspiration really
things that extended through the whole syllable were probably were better than ones that were just located in part of it
what's that
keys
there he goes
keys
you want these keys too
tape
tape
let me see that better
i don't want to let you uppy ross
i don't want to let you uppy even though you have your nice little
blanket on now
do you have a sore tooth
do you have a sore tooth
do you have a tooth coming in
oh yeah oh yeah oh yeah
he's doing a little chant
oh there's titus dingalinging up the steps
go out and tell your father you're sorry
get down off the bed and go out and tell daddy you're sorry
and he did
and he said it very nicely
and this morning speaking of politeness and all that
he climbed up on the chair and asked me for something
very nicely
and now i'm telling him to stop whining
i don't want you whining
for example i'm going downstairs
okay
don't whine
yeah
basically if you agree to do what he wants
uh something nice
and you tell him stops whining
he'll stop whining
he'll stop
if you don't tell him to stop whining he'll continue
yeah yeah
you've gotta be very explicit in what you say
okay
i was fooling with his nose and he said
oh
he doesn't want no more help daddy
i got that coming up
he wanted me to get his stick
he was outside and he wanted to come in
he says
and we were watching tv oh here's marky
that was the cat
that's not marky
okay what will mark talk about
we saw the gonk and the glimore something on tv
these are some wug type nonsense creatures nonsense muppets
lived on some silly planet
and about two hours later he asked me
he really wanted the gonk
what's going on
that's marky in the background
he's going
dadadada
where's the ball
what happened to the ball
i thought that was rather nice
he just learned the word seth
and did it rather nicely in a little sentence
not to roady
what are you doing
and this was a lie
because he had run out to try to find me
because he thought i was driving away
and i got out there and caught him in the act of looking for me
and also being out in the front yard where he's not supposed to be
so he said
i think he was really lying basically
he wasn't doing pee on the grass
no no he tried
go ahead and do it
he couldn't do it
because he didn't want to in the first place
he didn't want to do pee
he calls his bottle flintstones
means i don't want my bottle
may i say that last week it was barney
yeah he calls it barney
and calls it bottle and now it's flintstones
he's got lots of names for it
he's changing around a lot
yeah he has names for his bottle
yeah
um he was looking for spoons or pencils i guess
as if i want another also or i want another one too
i wasn't sure
i want one too i'm not sure
he might be confusing those
yeah that's what i was thinking
he's very into numbers
two and two right
i heard that sort of confusion before
i want two
i want it too
where's the other one
oh here it is
what was that mary
what you found
okay something
i'm going to take off your pants
so it looked like he was building it up out of the units
don't take off
and then what
don't take off my pants
and then he kind of readjusted because he like it better with the idea that off would follow pants
so don't take my pants off
he likes that better
so he kind of correct himself essentially to that
and i was cleaning his nose a lot this morning and trying to fix him up
he was having a lot problems
giving him medicine
giving him medicine right
and he really was getting unhappy
we told me we were trying to help him
trying to help him
try to help him feel better
but that was later
yeah i know later he said
he wanted mark to come downstairs with him
as a command that's a command mark coming downstairs
here he comes
here comes ross whining up the stairs
he's sick that's his problem today
was that from marky a bear sort of
i take away fra marky
i take away fr marky a bear
i take away fr marky a bear
and it was from marky
very carefully
and he did was he being mean about it
no
instead of saying you go to sleep like he usually says
also he smokes about anything now as a pipe
he smokes a pencil and what did he smoke this morning a teaspoon
yeah
okay
three times very insistently
it's sort of like he got pleasure out of saying it three times
did kitty go office ross
where did kitty go
is that what she did
kitty go bye bye
what did she do
where'd she go
yeah where did she go
she went away

yeah
was he a bad bear
was he a bad bear
right
and if we run into them we'll get real scared
cause they're very big
then he'll talk nice words and since they're animals animals always listen to tarzan
cause tarzan speaks the animal's language
he learned to do that when he was a little boy
cause he grew up in the jungle with a tiger family
no
because the tiger took him for a baby
was it a tiger or was it an ape
anyway tarzan grew up with the animals
when he was a baby he didn't have a mommy and a daddy
what do you want mark

i thought he said
i can do it i can do it
okay
i'll bet they were rabies weren't they
good
did he get well ross
and is that the end of the story
and then everybody said thank you to louis pasteur didn't they
cause he had figured out how to stop people from getting rabies
yeah
good
no ross

not true
it tastes like caterpillars
like caterpillars
see all those caterpillars crawling around
caterpillars taste yummy
no
why not
you're not eating them
why not
marky will eat them
and i asked ross
who wants apple juice
and mommy
what he means is that mommy is already drinking beer
so it is an incorrect use of the present instead of the progressive
golf head
and then did billy cry
did he think it was funny
what did he do
was he mad
was golf head a bad word
and then did billy go with his dad
did he feel like his dad was angry
really
why did his daddy call him a golf head
what does the dad do to him
what does the dad do to him
he does
like what
really
nose head
maybe that's because he has a nose on his head
he does
and does the daddy spank the little boy
no
does the daddy daddy ever give him kisses
i love spanking
does billy's daddy ever kiss him
so all the things that he does is he just uses bad words
well that is pretty bad wouldn't you say mom
does your daddy ever use bad words
do i ever call you anything bad
one word
there's one word i use
it's a little bit bad
what is it do you think

that's not a name
spanking's not a name
name
spanking's something you do
there's a name
that's a little bit bad
that sometimes i call you
yeah
what do think about that name
pretty funny
is it a good name or a bad name
is it as bad as golf head
it's gooder
right right
superman
but superman never loses
and then what
and if you're on the other side
well closer to the napkin and farther from the napkin
there are two positions there
right
so the guy that's farther from the napkin wins or loses
who was that
very good
that's exactly right
very good
if you have two of them what do you have
then you have storm troopers
or storm trooper people

i see
if they rot
now that's different between getting raw

uh
why does marky want that darth vader case
it beats you

is that what it means when you say
it beats me
is that what it means ross
no it means i can't figure it out
he beats me on the head
no that isn't what it means when you say
it beats me ross
think about it again
what does it really mean when you say
it beats me
you've got to figure out something
what does it mean
okay you lost it
you lost the game ross
you didn't figure out what it meant to say
it beats me
what does it mean
it hates me

how do you know
okay
well she's just turned a different way ross

it's the same gun
the bump is just because it's turned in in her hand
see you can see the bump on the side
that's the difference
no it's a different blaster
you're right
she's changed her blaster
it's a different blaster in her hand
you've got the wrong one there
this is the princess leia organa
it came with it
if it came with it it must be the right one
you're right
maybe we can figure out what went wrong
maybe they took the wrong picture ross
maybe they've got the wrong picture here
maybe they made a mistake when they made the picture
when they put it in the box
i see
so maybe when they packaged it up for the store they put the wrong one in there
do you think so
or do you think they made a mistake when they took the picture over here
when they made the gun and they put it into the box
and they gave it to you
do you think that maybe you made a mistake
well who made a mistake
not the person that chose the wrong gun
maybe the guy who made it made it right but somebody chose the wrong one
you don't think so
what if you go to the store and you're supposed to buy cherioos and and instead you buy raisin bran
do you say that the guy who made the raisin bran made a mistake
no
you say that the person who bought the raisin bran made a mistake
he should have bought cherioos
who made the mistake then
he made a mistake who made cherioos
no mark
he didn't make a mistake with cherioos he made a mistake in that he bought the wrong thing
you understand
is that right ross
i want apple juice gagoo
how do you say it
how do you say it mark
want more apple juice gagoo
i want more apple juice gagoo
how do you really say it
how do babies really say it ross
tell me the right way that a baby says it
well does he say
i want some more
what does he say
good
that's right
he messes it all up right
who else messes up words that you know
there's somebody else that you you know who messes up words
who else besides ben
yeah who else
somebody in star wars
somebody in star wars
who is it
he doesn't mess up words
he just does that funny talk
who else messes up words
no darth vader doesn't mess up words
darth vader talks right
chewbacca doesn't even talk so that's not the answer
who messes up words
who messes up words like a baby
who turns words around
uh huh
who is it
no
r two doesn't even speak
yoda
what does yoda do
for example
what does he say for example
he says
the training you must complete
instead of
you must complete the training
he says
the training you must complete
away put your weapon
he says
away put your weapon
instead of
put your weapon away
right
did you know that he was making a mistake
did you know that yoda was making a mistake
to tell him
yeah that would have been interesting
and you could have told yoda that he was making a mistake
that's right
do you think you could really get into star wars
wouldn't that be fun if you could really get in there and really be part of it
uh huh
why
they don't play star wars
yeah
well maybe when you get some friends you can teach them how to play some harder games
do you think that these kids are too old for you
maybe these kids that you're in with are pretty big kids aren't they
have you ever played with really big kids like this before
okay let's hear you don't like
go ahead
do they really
you do
what do the five year olds do
they beat on you
they beat your words
that isn't fair at all is it
what do you mean they beat your words
the big five year olds do that right
you know what you can do
well that's one thing you can do
you know else you can do
you can get the four year olds all organized okay
get them into a a little group
get all the four year olds so they can figure out how to get those five year olds to stop it
what you need to do is get a bunch of friends and then if those five year olds come by and bother you you guys can work together and stop them
hide or play tricks on them
play tricks on the five year olds
you can stay away but i think the best idea is to play tricks on them
say
you five year olds are going to be the losers
i have a better idea
we're going to play trick on you
i have a better idea
petition
the four year olds can petition to have the five year olds removed
that would scare them away
that would scare them away
oh ross
get all of your bunch to figure out a plan
okay can you do that that tomorrow
get all of your kids to figure out a plan against the five year olds okay
that would work really good
do they really have real guns
do those those five year olds really have guns

yes
you must know
you know all the things that you need to know
i don't know
oh
i don't know why
oh i see

i don't know
because it was a dutch computer
oh i see
who's your best boy friend
oh he's really fun isn't he
really
oh melanin
how do you know that
what do you mean
what are you talking about
is that a game you play play at school
where did you get that
is that where you found out about melanin
what do you want to show me little boy
well tell me about it
i'm going to give you lick back or a back lick
which one do you like better

is that a made up word
how about kisser
what about running
what about kissing
marky marky what's daddy doing
giving me some
right
dadadadadada nobody sing this song
well the answer is i don't have anything for this afternoon
ross
is that too bad
is that good or bad
bad
what do you want
what kind of presents do you want
yeah but we wouldn't buy anything right
and then what ross if the sensor scope is missing
and we won't buy any toys
well what if there is a sensor scope
does that mean we're supposed to buy it
what do you mean you don't know
what do you mean you don't know
you forgot the whole argument
no he didn't
he didn't
he knows very well
he knows that i've said that i'm not going to buy anything
he knows very well that there's a possibility that if it were there that maybe we would buy it
he also knows that if he says that
that he wouldn't get it
that he'd be in less of a position to say so
right
so he's saying
well maybe we could just go and take a look
once we get there then we can figure out how to get them to really buy it right
is that the idea ross
how are you going to get r two
he's being very noncommittal
how are you going to get your parents to get you r two
say nothing and hope
and what else do you do
what
work hard with your other new toys
show that you're a good boy
ross
poor dear
and maybe you'll get something nice
oh i know another way you can get your r two
take your money out of your piggy bank
would you like to do that
maybe it's time to take your money out of your piggy bank
and then you don't have to be nice
you can take your own little money
you don't have to be nice
isn't that great
do you like it better when you're not nice or when you are nice
when he doesn't have to be nice
it's better when he doesn't have to be nice
you put that in his mouth
he is nice so he doesn't have to be nice
okay ross would you like to eat some breakfast
no we can't
how are we going to buy it
oh wait
now wait a second
if it doesn't cost a lot money there'll be no problem in buying it
what do you mean even if it doesn't cost a lot money we can still buy it
you mean that if it does cost a lot money then we can't buy it
if it costs a lot money then we can't buy it
what did you mean
tell me the whole idea again
that's what he meant if it isn't too much money then we can buy it
but he said even if it doesn't
so he's got even if wrong
he means if it doesn't cost a lot money then we can buy it
what about even if it does cost a lot money
then will we buy it
not if it costs too much money no
and even if he doesn't finish his breakfast
in other words we still have a lot action figures to buy
what do you mean ross
go ahead tell me
for new ones
which ones don't we have

it's a good idea if you want to get your dad to do something
think about
what
no
no because the money won't cheat me
no
what do you think ross
do you think i should worry about it
why
that's though
okay
okay okay but just go on talking about the money machine
why do you think i should worry about it
why give me a good reason to worry
well maybe there's no reason to worry
i'll write the names now i'll write the names on the very bottom
i have to go pee pee
don't say that
don't say what dad's saying

you've got the right idea
earlier mommy was saying how boys want any breakfast and mommy raised her hand too
i can't fix them
it was a very nice thing for him to say
later
just thank you
there's just a little bit left and you can have it when you finish what you have on your plate

no that's that's just that you're getting better at putting away
right
very good ross
right okay that was very interesting
so i can have the light from the back
why
although it is true it's nice to have this light come from behind
it is not is isn't
you don't like my explanation
easier on my eyes right
but was my explanation really a bad explanation
no but not whether my idea was a bad idea
but when i told you the reason i put it up there was to get light from behind
did you think that was really wrong
what was the real reason that i did it
okay thank you
where do you have to put your legs up
yeah
i'm not telling
no maybe they're for me and i'm not telling
well maybe they're for grandpa and grandma
i'm not sure
i want to go outside and see the witches
what
what's so fare about that
yes
and what's fare for you
so that the part that's fare for me is that i don't have to do too much
and what's the part that's fare for you
oh you get to do some
ahhah
i'm falling
is that a good deal for both of us do you think
okay but i thought you were going to talk about another problem you and i have
you forgot about the other problem
what is it
what is that other problem
it had to do with the telephone
yeah there was a problem with the telephone
upstairs in my room
no
there was a little problem we had
what was it
and you hit marky and so what's the problem
and what other problem was there
what
no what was bad about it
yeah and what else
and what else
and you still haven't ap to your grandfather
so there are three bad things
first that you hit marky
okay four count them
to marky you didn't apologize to marky
okay and then third
yeah
and four
no that wasn't that's not something wrong
going to your room is a punishment it's not something you did wrong
okay you want me to tell you what the fourth is
you didn't apologize to grandpa for not talking to him
you still haven't done that you could do that still
no he didn't do that
and there's one more of the thing that you did that was wrong
is that you made it so your father couldn't talk to grandpa
five things
okay now which of those can we fix
of those five there is one that we can still fix
daddy
okay
two of them you fix one of them right now
yeah
okay what about the other one
how do you fix that one
when are you going to do
which one
what do you mean maybe today but really tomorrow
ow my foot is falling
you promise you will do it tomorrow
promise
okay and what other promise did you make for me tonight
no no you made another promise to me earlier tonight what was it
it had to do with the lego blocks
what was the promise
no it had nothing to do with that
you made me a promise remember the little lego blocks
you made a promise to your father
okay did you do it
ahhah and are they all fixed and put back
do you know what happened
marky took them togeth apart again
okay
no no your promise is that you're going to get those blocks back
that's your promise
you understand what a promise is
well that's another problem
now remember what happens if you don't fulfill your promise
what's supposed to happen
okay so is that ready are we ready for that
jump over
okay then after do you promise to put the blocks back together
yeah promise promise
do you promise too
okay
sure honey
something happened to santa claus
yeah i guess he needs to be blown up again
what hole
no i didn't find a hole up there
okay honey there wasn't a hole on the very top
well just wait a second ross you just tell me here's the hole
it's not a hole
that's just maybe it's broken
maybe that's where it's broken
it's not broken
not not broken ross you're just wrong it's that simple
i want to play santa claus
you mean that hole right there
there's no hole
there's just no hole there honey
okay let ross touch the hole mom
here's the hole
let him touch it
i found the hole
i found the hole guys
okay we we're pretty sure that santa claus is broken now
we're pretty sure santa claus is broken because somebody jum hit him too hard
no that's where dad took ross out of the bath and put him on the bed when he was all wet
why what do you mean even when they're dry
oh that's true
do you want more milk
honey you don't say
just my second one
it was my second one
and i don't want anymore
you say
it was just my first and i want one more but it was my second and i'm finished
is that right
girl isn't a baby either
didn't you forget something
this morrow i don't want to take my shoes
why
these are for boys
of course that's not a good reason
right
that's how he put it
it was a huge balloon uh
it wasn't a little heman
oh that's great ross that's great
marky did you see that
at
they did
at children's palace uh
when did you guys go to children's palace
oh you went you saw them on tv
oh the add
do you want toys ross
right those toys you want are for christmas so why should we go to children's palace
we already
oh well we'll go after this christmas is finished okay
i want a real real bad monster who steps on heman
your 
oh they don't have any more
they're not going to get for a awhile only if we're lucky
they stopped carrying 
isn't that horrible
just like they stopped showing the phoenix dirty trick right
is that fare ross
do you want some of the potatoes
right
why can't i
you teasted teased me you tricked me into that
right
do you still play with brian
sometimes
how come you learned learned it from him
he does
do you ever play with him at all
who do you play with now
yeah who do you play with now
and
and
austin and maria lane no
and who else
jeannie
jeannie
okay
that means you didn't go outside
it means don't go
we cuffed outside so we not outside right
we no
we didn't go outside so cuffed means didn't go
how about we cuffed go outside
what do you say
uncuffed go
ahhah uncuffed means yes
oh uncuffed means yes
well that's nice
and the word what is the word
that means that
uncuffed right
and what if i say to you do you want some chocolate what do you say
that means no
and what if i say do you want ah some toys for christmas
what do you say
uncuffed good very good
tell the whole story now
uhhum
uhhum
well where where are the meat
where is the meat
in his tummy
yeah but in meat eaters where's the meat
so on the meat eaters the meat is all over and on the planter eaters don't have any meat
ross that can't be right
that doesn't make sense
all animals have me are full with meat
meat eater means they eat meat
dad
yes marky just a minute
what is that
bologna and um mayonnaise mayonnaise not butter it's not marky
oh
it's not butter
is that butter
no
they're recording
that's okay
um ross it doesn't make any sense
to say that that the plant eaters don't have any meat
is this butter
because their bodies are made of meat
your body is made of meat
only if you eat meat
you have meat in it
yeah you have meat in your body
yeah but there is no meat in your tummy unless you eat meat
you see you gotta understand something okay
your tummy if you eat plants your tummy takes the plants and puts them into the tummy and makes them into meat and puts the meat all over your body
muscles
muscles muscles are meat
you take plants okay you you see that apple sauce
that's not meat is it
now if you eat that apple sauce what's going to happen
no it'll go no your going to make apple sauce arms
no
which is right unless you want seconds or thirds or in case you want seconds or thirds
which one did you say
what's the difference
hum
it make more sense
good ross
do you want some milk
oh i'm sorry honey ross spilt some water
what happened ross
tell the whole story
well what's you say
yeah go ahead it's okay
tell the whole story
and it feels like i was shocked
shocked
i feel something in my neck and it feels like i was shocked
it felt like i was shocked
what
sure they can
but how do you get a headache that shocks
you must be sick
how about mom
is she sick
okay
marky said get out his way i'm playing robin
get out of this way
let's go eat breakfast
to sleep
oh right yeah he needs a nice soft bed doesn't he
okay
what
how'd you learn to count by
you learned to tell time
uhhum
heh ross
is that twelve o'clock midnight or is that twelve o'clock noon
if it's late at night is it midnight or is it noon
right midnight mom
oh
i don't know to eat some berries
yeah
why did the bear cross the street ross
right
could you play
mom makes good toast
why ross
right a pony has four legs
very good
i want to interject that um this i believe that this comes from you telling him that you didn't even want to hear him asking
not tonight but other times
there has been quite a deal made over asking
sometime i do i don't even want to hear you ask for it
yeah and
and so he asked could i ask
yeah and it sounds like a politeness form but it actually has a very obvious function may i ask can i get away with it
well he may have i doubt i doubt that explanation
i can't imagine but he you know
certainly certainly it could be supported it could be supported
ross said
guess what daddy when i was in denver i sent a whole list of i sent a list when i was three years old in denver i sent a list to santa
yeah he sent a list to santa of what he wanted and uh
how'd he know he was three in

now how did he know he was three
in denver

oh magician

how did you know it was the bone ross
because i noticed it before you did right
um and he's right it is a kind of a little bone end onto the bone on the end of the sword
here it is ross

what did you want to say about a story

although he might not have thought realized how funny it was
that means the last one
yeah i will
but i can't come right now
right
which was ross and icey
right actually though what but what interests me about that was the sort of he ross has developed sort of a bit marky talk dialect which is
he wants you he loves you
he repeats things for mark to make sure that mark understands
yeah it's sort of
he doesn't use big sentences with mark uses nice clear little sentences
you know mark said roshie to ross because ross says roshie to mark in that baby
yeah right my name is roshie right
you're full huh
well that she probably she looks thou she probably does look the way she looks in the picture
the big lie is that they are trying to tell me without saying it in words that uh i will look just like her if i use that
oh i farted
fart is not a bad word
that's not a bad word
don't talk with your mouth full
and i say nothing right

t w o
p a i r
good cloth

what did the cloths cross the road
why did the cloths cross the road my hunch
yeah ross why did the cloths cross the road
run over run over
life is tough isn't it ross
not as tough as you
daddy do you know the punch line
what is it
to jiggle his head
is that why the car crossed over the road
no the cloths
the cloths crossed over the road to jiggle it head
they did the buttons cross the road
to go snap snap snap
no
what
because a
cause what
nod their head
they nod their head
that's why the button's cross the road
of course
why did
everybody knows that
why did the shirt cross the road
why did the bunny cross over the road
because he wanted to crash his head
give me another one mark
why did the the leak out of his that
cause he was thirsty
no cause oh oh oh oh he was going to get out of home
oh i see
the cow
no
who
who
the milk in the glass
i see it's going to get out of his stomach of course
okay why did the milk drink out of the glass because he
he's gonna get out of
using the verb
i noticed that
goes to the milk
get drunk out of the glass by the milk get drunk and it's it's because he was saying drunk
umhum

scary to go to another persons house
well when you went to hungry you didn't take all your toys with you

it doesn't sound like a good idea ross
i said ross
did you think i said r mark
it was kind of silent i didn't say it very clearly
yeah
you're right
no
maybe you heard it maybe i said it's on the tape recorder should we go back and listen
do you want to go back and listen and see if we can find the truth
very interesting maybe your were right and i was wrong
who do you think is really right let's go listen
we went back and listened to the tape recorder and we couldn't hear the difference it was sort of mushy
so i think i understand how ross thought it might have be mark
but i didn't
right
right
that's not really wood that's sort of foamy brick
it's called foaming brick
foaming brick
no no that's the horseradish
that's the bitter herb

the big stick of horseradish has two ends and the foaming brick is just flat
you licked your kitty
he's pretty grotty isn't he

i always dream about killing things

ross is a big boy he knows a lot things
was it
did you really have a game

i like the different one too
the new one
i like the new one too

do you play that game too mark up in the rec room
yeah yeah no yeah
dad does marky's class come with yours

okay now you're missing good jokes
whose idea was it really
ross's
think so
did you have anything to say
why did you call
please don't rip it
okay go ahead and do it to see if i care
was it right was you did
what do yo mean how should you have known
you should use your head and think if it was a good idea
brain
daddies always tease their boys
sure
at school or at home
hey daddy tell them about this and tell them that i gave it to you too
where do you want me to put these up on my door
right on your door
okay i'll take them to work and tell them that my son made them them for me okay
what are we going to do next
i don't know

we could try to learn work on a book
okay
put some of this over here
what is that that's a little pelican
a mina bird
my turn now
i'm going to go like this
i can
what
ready
i said
those are rossy's
you keep rossy's and you keep mine
i've got to jump you now
oh very bad boy
yeah very sneaky
no you can't do that ross
after you jump you move and you have to jump again if you want want to move again
you just jump over him and that's it
that's all you can do you can't go any further
because that's the way to play it
that's next turn
you do that next turn
but you won't have a next turn because i'm going to cheat and jump you
i'm not going to cheat but i'm going to be sneaky
watch this
one jump two jumps see
there's a sneaky way to get me
i'm not going to tell you
no you can't do that
that's not a a possible move
you can't move backwards until you're a queen
a king
yeah right okay go ahead
i'm not going to give you any help
they're kings and queens
want me to give you a little help
you can put this guy here
you're kind of trapped right
you're trapped
yeah if you moved him up here then that would be bad move
you you have to leave him there so it blocks me
i'm sad because no one brought me a present
yeah
is that right ross
marky that's not fair
what does that mean
doesn't he say bomit
yeah he says bomit
ross you just make your daddy's life hard you know
gee ross i've got a lot work to do
do you know what i mean
is that pretending
no that's not pretending
what were you you pretending
i see
then he fell down for real by accident
yeah and it was an accident
it was an accident
mark
what mommy what
are there six more shows
the third eye
five and six more shows
no wait
how many more shows
that's not right
how many have they had so far
and how many are left
right
and what are there names
number
good
how many
ha ha ha
he said there are two more left
oh
jump mark jump
ross
don't push him don't push him
are there six shows
in all
how many in all
that's what i didn't want you to do
ow
i didn't push you
ross do you know how to put the under roo's away
yeah just drop them in the right place
did you do a good job on it ross
okay
do you want to have any tapes
yeah
but i might leave anyway
so what are we going to do have tapes or not
how come
okay good
marky has to have him first
well just go hide it in a place somewhere where no one will will find it
where mommy and daddy can't find it
well how are you going to remember in the morning where it is
what do you mean
ross let's talk about whether you should give sean the sword
now why don't you want this
to be friends with another boy
you what
but um okay i understand what you are saying
but then how is sean going to feel
well think about how you feel when other people have you ever ever been a kid and they don't play with you
other kids won't play with you
how does that feel
you don't feel too bad in that situation
just find another kid to play with
and then don't you need more that one kid to play with
what if no one with play with you
no one at all
what if your brother won't play with you
brothers always play huh
well what if there really really was horrible and even the brother wouldn't play
that's smart ross
he's a smart isn't he
so you think sean should've done that no one was being being nice to him he should've just left
that's a good idea
so you don't ever want to be nice to sean huh
how come
well how about grandma
are you ever going to be nice to her
she pokes you
she doesn't always poke you
she likes you ross
grandma really likes you
she buys things presents for your birthday
what if she promised not to do that anymore
what if we got grandma to promise not to poke you anymore would you like her then
no but what if she really stopped it
no wait ross what if she stopped it then why would you be mad at her
but you're going to get old someday too
well how old is your mommy
because you should learn how old your mommy is that's how you you should know
your mommy's thirty eight
when you write on the the mothers day present for her and on her birthday present you have to to know how old she is
okay
are you going to be mean to old people
just because grandma is old are you going to be mean to her
think about it
you have your own body
kind of but sometimes you have to think about other people like like sean and grandma and
no one makes you and you shouldn't yell
because people i'll tell you the reason
do you remember about about god
do you remember god
okay god wanted people to be nice to each other
you don't believe in god
okay well then what makes you want to be nice to other people
yeah but what if other people were nasty to you
and you wouldn't have any more friends
so maybe it's a good idea to be friends with kids
think about it
just think about the idea of being nice to everybody
let's think about a world where everyone is nice
i'm not bossing you
i'm asking you to use your head
you don't want to think about other people huh
you don't think about being nice to other children
well think about think about your own brain being nice to other kids
okay i'll tell you the rules
do you want me to tell you the rules
then i should tell you beforehand
okay every time you go to a party with kids
listen let me tell the whole rules
i'll tell you the whole deal
whenever you go to a party with kids you have to be nice to all the kids
when you go to school you have to be nice to all the kids at school
and when you go on a picnic and a boy scout party you have to be be nice to all those kids to and you'll have to be nice to all the kids you ever see and when you go to the mall you have to be nice to everybody
ross that's not nice to your father
your father's heart is going to break ross
yes
that's it and there'll be no more father for you
well then you'll be nasty to her and her heart will break
but they're too old and you don't love them
well but if you don't love them if you want to just be nice to me i'm not really old and i don't poke my finger in you and you can have a better deal by being nice to me so i wouldn't die
you do
but you didn't want to talk about my things i was talking about
it's not with your body
ross it's not your body you're doing things
because you have a good little heart
you want to really listen to the answer
wait a second
wait
it means that there is an answer to your question
are you ready to listen to the answer
in your heart you know right here where your heart is
you're not listening
right in here is your heart
if you have a good lovely chocolate heart then you want to be be good to other people
if you have a mean hexy heart sketzy heart
do you know what what sketzies were like
then you want to be mean to other people
are you a sketzy
yeah
why
the grogg in raggedy ann
now if your brother falls and you have a warm heart then you'll go and you'll help him
you don't have a warm nice heart
you don't to be a friend of brothers
see i know you love brothers
okay no more talking about it
i'm not going to boss you ever again
i'm finished bossing
i know you have good warm heart and you'll do it for your own sake and not for mine anymore
so that's the end of my bossing you
really
that's a dirty trick
are you going to try to do things so that they'll make me mad
no okay
no that's not the dirty trick that's not the deal
the deal is that i just stop bossing you and you do the good things for yourself

if i see anybody bouncing what will i do
i don't want to go to school
daddy i know how to open my door now
i'm not going to drive

what did you say marky
i don't know
you said i'm going to push the button down or something

i'm not going to drive i said
do you know how to drive
ross tell mommy the whole background to this about how there's there's a friend of yours who thinks there is fire bird and all those
and flier bird
okay who's this friend ross
who are you talking about
hold on a second
barry barry
is barry in your grade
okay you sit here and tell me the whole story
you don't want to to do it lying around
okay
now what do you think barry what happens with barry
what did you figure out
and i said maybe it's true
maybe there is a commercial
and you said may be
maybe what
the third one
what is the third one ross
the third set
okay what are the first two sets of he man
what what are the other sets of he man
what set is this ross
yeah you already said battle cat
okay and what's the other the second bunch
what does it mean in between
how do you know that it's in between
how do you know that it's in between
why isn't he
why isn't he in the first bunch
why isn't he in the first bunch
why isn't fakir in the first bunch
fakir
yeah why isn't fakir in the first bunch
he came out when did he come out
how do you know that he wasn't really in the first bunch how do do you know that he wasn't part of the first bunch
he's the last one of the first bunch
but where do you see him
where do they and when they make ads where do they put fakir
they don't add him anymore
and what is the third bunch
and what is the third bunch
but don't you think that zoar might be flier bird
what does zoar do
what would he be
okay now tell me a story about all the people in the first bunch
what are they
supposing i didn't know about them
oh you don't me to tell you you don't want me to tell
but you know something
ross that you didn't figure out
you know you know what's in the first bunch because you know all those pictures they used to have on the back did fakir ever get in those
are you sure
is fakir in the second bunch
so they never put fakir in any of the bunches
yeah the did
you made a mistake ross
at the end of the first bunch they started to sneak fakir into into those pictures
yup they did
no it won't show you in the books it was on the backs of the the toys and we didn't save that
how would that prove it
where are we going to find that
you mean at the toy store
i know how you can tell
the toys have numbers
issue numbers
and you can tell on the back of one of the toys when they sell all of them they come with their numbers
you can compare the numbers
but the interesting thing is that ross realizes that there are two waves of these things that are found why i just barely realized realized myself and he even hypothesizes that there was a third wave and that these unknown toys that this boy barry was talking about must be part of a third wave of these toys
i'm sure that there will be a third wave
you mean roots
an orchid
isn't he a terrible little brother
why isn't he as bad as i think he is
but he does understand some things
i do understand
do you understand mark
yes
he does understand
what does he not understand
no earlier you said he doesn't understand infinity and some other things
no it makes two infinities and eight
and that is an unreal number
that's a fantasy number
did you know that infinity is a fantasy number
because you could never really get there in reality
in reality you can get to infinity
right because you'd have to live forever
yes
so it's fantasy
infinity is fantasy
good night
good night mom
what was the hardest part of your day
okay what was the hardest part of your day
come on in mark
can we take our backs
sure
after you come back then you'll go to the movies
let's take the other car other car because we might need to to carry big things
it's ark
it's a boat
it's a good question right ross
okay now ready to come in
and we can't take the toys
no but can take your belts off
do you do good jobs
what's the best job to have
but is there anything interesting about it ross
yeah ross i did
they were messing up the car
i sure hope todd and his family don't get here too late and miss it
if they do we'll have to tell them about the exciting part they missed
one of the guys disappeared just like the wicked witch in the wizard of oz
who
oh really
how about marian
marian didn't do it
you go one two three four five six seven eight
you you count that way
people would get very confused if you went that way
it wouldn't work out well
you could make it up too if you want
do they still check you for lice at preschool
ross was pretending he's a servant he said
at your servants
at your servants my king
instead of at your service right
which one is it
at your servants or at your service
at your servants my king
the real word is service
no why ross
from your service my king
right
that's cute ross
what is a servant
what does a servant do
kind of like a slave
but a nice one huh
and the king's not mean to him right
and what else
we're the kings
we're the kings up here and you're our little servant
i'm the one that
you can't have any blankets servant
okay you can have a little blanket servant
if you're good
there okay
we're the the kings right
but i'm the one that has glasses
what happened here
maybe it felled fell
good marky good
he really is doing well isn't he
when you were a little boy three years old there were were some things you could do better than what marky can do now
like you could tell long stories about star wars
no and why is that
and when do you think they're going to stop
okay and how about when return of the jedi is finished
i see
but then we won't have any more toys
we'll have more toys we'll have as many toys as you want
mark
you can have as many toys as you want
isn't that true ross
ross you mean advertise
but you don't want the baby why didn't they have babies ross
they didn't grow them
why
did they stay inside
what did it say
did you read it
what ross
what about it
i understand
then how did you see it
oh yeah
what does it tell you
yes
which bears ross
yes
are they just the same size and everything
how can it drink milk
i see
and are they the same color as the mommies
how come
i see
you mean in mommy's tummy
real inside where there was blood
that's nice
and that's where they came when they were babies
right
is that where they grew
well then did the care bears grow their babies
inside them
but you said they didn't get fat
oh
i see
neat huh
so they can't have any babies on the show huh
where did you get the name for the little bear
on the back of the box
and the name of the bear is what
skyscraper
trust him
my goodness
that is quite involved
they call skyscrapers skyscrapers because you know how big skyscrapers are
wasn't that a joke about little john
is it the same kind of joke
do you think it's a funny joke
what if i called you he man
it would be a joke
it would just sort of be a because you're not really a huge muscle yet
what if i called you darth vader
but what if i said that i was just playing a game would it be funny then
but it would be like fantasy then
it's hard to tell the difference between humor and fantasy
up in your weapons drawer

what
okay well that's okay
okay
no that's okay go ahead ross no no no no please
thanks that's nice
that's good for my arm
what's wrong mark
now which story do you want to hear about the machines
okay about a long time ago
how did it start
you don't remember the story
well don't you remember part of the first part
and what did the cavemen have
and what things didn't they have
tell me some things that they didn't have
yeah
and what did they do with those big thick sticks
know what those things were called
clubs
yeah
yes they are
okay you wanna hear some more stories about them
sure that's another tool they made they took a piece of skin from an animal
a real long piece and they put it into a stick from a tree
and then at the very back they put a stone
and they pulled it back back and then it shot
shot it like that
or sometimes they'd wrap it around slinging it around and let it fly
and that's called a s they're both called slingshots okay
in the old days yes
there were many enemies to the people sometimes there were other people who were enemies and sometimes wild animals
did you know about that
that's true do you think they fought with dinosaurs
no not with really
that's a mistake
the dinosaurs were long before when the dinosaurs walked on the earth there were no people
no but saber tigers and wooly mammoths did woolly mammoths lived with with the caveman and they were huge
yes they were real they were real
you think so
that's just in flintstones
how do you know
oh they were still just monkeys
may maybe so okay now
so they were there
okay now you wanna hear the rest of the story
okay now the first thing they did those first thing those people did ross when they wanted to eat they would have to hunt and kill an animal and then eat the flesh that's right and that's of course a lot work first of all right
and also kinda yucky right
okay
but now how did they get out of the caves out of the stone age what did they do
do you have any idea
no
to get out of the caves
no
you know what they did
that was very important
the most important thing of all
fire
they learned how to make fire
would you guys know why is that so because they used the fire to make to make iron
iron and bronze and metals so they could make metal they used hot they took the dirt
and they burned hot hot fires and the hot fires made the dirt into strong knives
and into guns and into a uh shovels
no they could make shovels they took things and they made big tools with the fire that's why fire was very important ross and mark did you know that marky
what
why
then they could dig caves but you know what else they could do with a shovel
dig holes for plan to plant plants
or they could make a palace they could build big buildings you see
right
right and so these people worked very hard they made these tools and now you know what they could do next
they started to make machines do you know what kind of machines they could make
first they could make machines to lift things like big pulleys and things like so you can lift up on top of the building and they made big huge wagons so they could carry things you heard about the wheel do you know what the wheel does
the wheel makes it so you can roll wagons with big wheels can roll down the hill
daddy
now we getting to the cowboy part aren't we
we're getting close to cowboys okay
yeah
and then all first we have to go through do you remember robin hood time
yeah
okay robin hood had arrows right
yeah
and he had swords
yeah
and they had guns
yeah
oh they just starting they were just starting making the ssh they didn't have guns yet but they did have swords
forest weapons
okay
okay now came
right
no
because they didn't have gun powder yet
gun powder came from
middle ages
okay well they had the forest weapons and they could build a lot shovels and axes but they still didn't know how to make big machines and then came the time of the great machines and s people started building machines to do lif
oh okay well oh and there was armor i forgot to tell you about armor
a knights in armor used to have masks on their head made of steel marky do you know like he man and man at have masks made of steel and they have all covered with steel
but those are still not machines they're just weapons and tools okay
think of a machine what is a machine
yeah
okay
so four forty four comes back that's a machine

you could send one of the daddies to when its time for me to teach classes and things at school you could send the the other daddy down
i'd just stay home and play with you
i'd get fired you're right
that wouldn't work out too well
let's think of a better idea

what about the people
the bad guys

the persons can
go out the door and throw them in a deep hole
ummhm
they all got out
ummhm
the bad guys opened the doors and got out and the very good persons throw them in the deep hole
they all lie dead
they're dead
yeah
oh good
the deep hole that not have teeth in it doesn't eat them up
not a sarlak
what does it look like
it looks like the sarlak in that movie
that had that all the bad guys got eaten
and it that this kind of hole doesn't have teeth to eat them
does the sarlak have teeth
what
does the sarlak have teeth
what
does the sarlak have teeth
does
yes
does
yes
yes
does this hole have teeth
what
does this hole have teeth
no
why not
because um well because people uh that um that that not that kind of hole didn't brush teeth so his teeth fell down and dropped in his mouth
oh i see
that's why he doesn't have teeth anymore
i see
but but
ummhm
and you know what
what
there's a very good person in each of these cars
yeah
you know what they're going to do
what
jump over the sarlak
they can
good
the cars can fly
i know that
over this car is the sarlak
over there
on the floor
yeah
the floor is the sarlak
does it have teeth
no it no but this hole but this hole does have teeth
the one's over there do
watch out marky if you walk like that you're going to fall into one of those holes
i can fly with the cars
you might fall right into one of those holes
what
you might fall right in
so
invisible persons don't fall in
are you an invisible person
yeah
no you're not invisible
you're a little boy
i'm just pretending i'm invisible
you're not invisible you're a little boy
i'm pretending i'm invisible
oh i see
i see
i'm not for real invisible
no
mark said this
daddy
tell me about the big one
the big one puts the napkin on his mouth
if where else can it his his hand his here's a hand that goes like shwoosh
he holds a napkin and he holds it with his wheel
that's what his big brother does his big brother does when he has throw
ummhm
in his mouth
why do they get throw
what
why do they get throw
he does
why
why
why do they get throw
he doesn't and he does
do you know why that happens
no
they go around so fast and they get dizzy right
ummhm
he said this this big brother car is not so allergic to throw right
which one's not so allergic mark
the big brother car
he was making it go around in circles and they were getting dizzy
he
so this big brother car is not
the big brother
so allergic
his big brother always liked little brother
ummhm
it
he's nice to the little brother
yeah the big brother doesn't all the all the day all the time all the time his big brother doesn't beat his little brother up
that's right
big brother's nice and good to his little brother
um
right
and helps the little brother learn
the
and plays with him a lot
he he doesn't he doesn't like to beat him up
no
not at all
he doesn't beat him
no
he just gives him a
he
ride or something
yeah
now he's going to just
ummhm
something like this
show me
he's gonna go in slow big circles
that's a nice big brother isn't it
little brother wants to get out he d the fast ones with his little
if he wants to get in he doo does small things
no
no he does slow
he does slow
does he doose does them or does he does them
he does slow
ummhm
he does slow spins if he wants to get in
that's right
check it out so he does fast so he's going to do fast fast spins
reasoning from the previous premise
fast spins because his little
the brother has a big house
brother almost got out
his little brother went to play
a big full house
with toys at his house
the big brother has a big house a big full house that's full of what
it has his big house has a big a big to a lot uh food in he has a lot food in his big big house
oh good good good
that's nice
so if brother wants them
so if his brother gets hungry you know
so if his little brother
ummhm
his little brother just has one thing to eat
what's that
a bottle of milk and what with what with milk and
coo takes them to his house
ummhm
and he
you hungry
ummhm
takes them to his house and he's too hungry
yeah
good
he's more hungry
is he still hungry
ummhm
nah
he's not hungry right now
he's not hungry right now okay
oh yeah he is hungry
he he still hungry so he his big brother is probably going to take him to eat something
ummhm

that's all there is
okay now everybody want to go to sleep now
sure
good night darlings
i told ross that it wasn't wouldn't be fair to cry just because i'm giving a trono to another boy that's adam just uh he shouldn't cry because it makes me think that he doesn't want the other boy to have something nice
and what did you say then ross
actually he said
you know the set up of the double hypothetical just think what if
uh and i never could have gotten one
how would that have happened ross
oh i see
i see
you think it might have worked that way
i see
now a little earlier you told me that you were pretty sure that the trono was for you
and why did you think that
and i wouldn't and you said i would i w
you said you wouldn't have hided it or wouldn't have hid if it had been for me
isn't that what you said
how did you say it ross
because it was yours i would have hid it away
do you think it's somebody else's
why do you think that
no no
okay but you but you thought you say that you think it's for you
why do you think it's for you
and why did you think so in the first place
what was the reason
no and the reason was no the reason was that you said that i didn't tell you who it was for
if it was yeah if it wa if it was hi if i was hiding it from you then it was sure to be yours because if it was for adam i wouldn't try to hide it would i
so do you still think that reasoning is good
do you still think that's that's good thinking or have you changed your mind now
who do you think it's for
if it's for adam then why not show it to you right
then i do show it to you
well i'm not going to show it to you so what does that mean
you you think now it's for you
are you sure of that
maybe i'm just hiding it from adam
so you think that's a pretty good uh okay
so what how do you feel about it
who's it for at this point
who would you guess
who would you guess if you had to guess
is it for ross or for adam
you're not sure now
now daddy keeps on telling you it's for adam right
so you can't make up your mind can you
well it's tough isn't it
what
no way
daddy's are not s to tell
daddy's are never supposed to daddy's
how do you know that
you know something ross
you're right
you're right
it's for you
yes
it is
it's for you
you guessed it
because if i hide it there's no way that i would hide something that is for adam if it's for adam why should i hide it right
the only reason i should hide it is because i don't want you little kids to see it
you got it right
you got the right answer
yes son
what
trono
yeah i know the whole story
it's the first book of tron before there was tron
there was a trono
that's part of the whole that's part of the the trilogy
revenge of the jedi

i'm going to tell on you
ross do you think that mark could tell on me to mommy

he said
burping at the table too
burping quiet at the table too

wasn't that a team
oh
oh maybe you're right
maybe you're right
okay but they don't really they don't really murder people on it now do they
no i didn't know

there are some of those programs that have a lot murder right
oh what do you mean it's been on a long time
it had been on for a long time you mean
and i hadn't let you see it
is that right
and you missed all the first parts of knight rider

no they're not
he was denying that they were the wrong size
he was saying
ross you were saying ross's are too big
right
he has them on
he has them on and he says
they're not too big
so anyway he basically denied my assumptions and also not following my reasoning
since he has denied my assumptions i think he didn't care to follow the rest of the reasoning
well yeah you're denying his assumption too
right
his assumption is that if he can walk around in them
then they're big big enough for him yeah
they're fine
yeah
and your assumption is the right size
is smaller
is smaller and
those are too big
because ross's size is bigger therefore

luke was a monster
never
rancor monster

i see
this wall is
this what
is is um stronger than the pretty pony

you don't know yet but you just did
he really ate soup in my dream
he just doesn't know
that's right
you just don't know ross

the real rossy wasn't in his dream ross
it was just the dream ross right
tiffany's ross
who's tiffany's ross
oh really
does tiffany have a boyfriend
where's tiffany
oh yeah
and her boyfriend is called
ross alexander
ross alexander macwhinney
ross alexander macwhinney
are you her boyfriend
are you sure you're not her boyfriend
and you know what
hey lookee what i've got
you know who i like better
his name is ross
you know who i like better than um um dumb dumb those dumb
who
who
uh those dumb mud
mud people
you know
yeah
know who i like better than those dumb hated mud people
who
i like better you and ross and mom and myself
better than those dumb hated mud people
yeah
were there mud people in your dream
no
i would kick them
you can't kick mud people
why not
know what ross
gargamel
i see
isn't that funny
how many kids wanna eat breakfast with daddy
i wanna sleep
i wanna sleep
he brought a picture to me and i said
what is that
and he said
i'll draw it
i'll show you what youdi what it is
and he went back and he wrote mhiabbi
and i said
oh it's uh mhiabbi
and he said
yeah whatever
and he said and he wanted a and he took it to mary and he said look mom it's a mobby
uh i mean mhiabbi
a what's interesting about this is that he he's a little bit earlier he was saying what's uh s e r b y s and i said it's a serbys and what's uh g o n k u r and this is a gonkur and he kept on spelling random letter combinations and i had to pronounce them
a lot them were unpronounceable
and he seems to have gotten the idea that you can just ts ts throw letters together and some how and some how they'll make a word
this is very much like uh when he was a little baby he used to sort of make up words even though they didn't really mean anything sort of to describe some unspecifiable thing
now he is writing them out
mary says that she used to do that when she was a kid
now i certainly never remember doing any thing like that
she also remembers uh taking pictures to people and asking them what what they were
again i'd never do anything quite like that i mean any where near like that
i can never did anything in fact that i can remember that was very fantasy oriented at all
well let's see we were um
ross is having some uh orange juice and uh i take took a little sip from glass before uh
i want some good juice
i gave it to him and ross complains said daddy took some of mine or something like that he said
and i said i'm just testing
and he said you're not testing
i already what'd you say
i already had a glass
and which means that
you knew it was okay because
i already had some and i liked it
i already had some and i liked it yeah
you you'd already poured me a glass and you knew it was okay at that point
and i knew it was okay
so why are you checking for the consistency at a later point
it couldn't have changed by now
i asked ross could you be a little nicer and he said i hate being nice
am i being nice
am i being nice
yeah you're being nice
and then he said i when were you so nice
and he said i had to be that way all the way home yesterday
had to be that way all the way home yesterday
in the car coming home from washington d c
that's true
you were good yesterday
well why do i have to make breakfast and bring you things
why do i have to be that good mother
when i'd really just like to sit here and stuff my face
just make coffee for me
just make the rolls for me
just serve myself forget you
yeah
yeah
stop doing
i have to say would you like some tea honey
and then if you say yes i have to go out there and make it instead of drinking my coffee
why do i have to be nice like that huh
ross come back
oh he's gonna give you a kiss
oh he's gonna
maybe he's come and do something nice
he came around and got his own honey instead of asking someone for it
because he knew that if he he would be told that he w he was asking and demanding for too too many things right
ross use your spoon when you do that okay
how come you didn't let him pour it
what
you do wan pour it
no it's too much
you're gonna lose your spoon
twirl your spoon
twirl it around
good
now go
hey good
marky what would you like
and then you can lick your spoon
but don't use it again
i know
marky uh just did a picture and he said i can't wait all day
he came up to me i can't wait all day
what he meant was that he wanted me too uh
i assume that what he want what it was me to put a name on it and have me date it so it was
or look at it
look at it or something yeah
pay some attention to it
and um so i put a name on it date it and uh and he i said okay go put it over on ross's desk and he said i'll put it in pile
in other words he didn't say the pile i put it in put it in a pile

to say what you want
he said to say exactly right
oh for i mean for for f a snack for a bed time snack
and then i said do you know what what precisely means
what's the difference between precisely and exactly
you said there's no difference right
do you think there's a little bit of difference between those two words
let's think about it
precisely
is not quite as exact as exactly
exact means absolutely perfect
precisely could just be a little bit off
it means you tried very hard but you might have missed it just a little
whatever you it was you were doing
oh maybe you were trying to figure out how big how big um
a toy how big a toy
how big a toy is
you bet it's hot
you bet your boody it's hot
that's they boil these things before they put them out
you bet your boodies
no the glass gets hotter than the plastic honey
because glass conducts heat
and plastic is an insulator
because it's not made of glass it's porcelain
no way
it's made of china
there's a difference
china is china and glass are both based on sand
they both come from sand but china has more lime in it
it makes it white
glass is pure sand
silica
do you know silica is a mineral it's an element
well bowls what kind of bowls
silica looks like mud
right
into a bowl

it's with a type of very pretty mud
that's made of metal
that's not mud
that's metal too
do you know how they make metal
i know you mean a
i know what you mean
i know exactly what you mean
you're talking about pottery
pottery is different than pottery is not the same thing as glass
you know how they make glass
they blow it with their with their lungs like a big balloon
they blow glass
they get it real hot then they get a tube and they and the glass blows up
a big tube

and then what happened
no then you came out and while i was mowing the lawn did this campaign about today or tomorrow today or tomorrow right
and i said who knows right
and then finally i gave in right
how did it happen
but before that i already started to promise you
how did i give in

but you asked me about ten times you know today or tomorrow right
and finally
and then i said i'll make you a deal if you read a book then i'll get it tonight

so you didn't get
nah
you mean like fiddling in s
in father s in father christmas yeah
feedling
fiddling not feedling
fiddling buttons fiddling buttons means you have to fiddle with them
right
anyway finally i got persuaded but the deal that we've struck
now is that this is gonna be the last present for a long time
right ross
and also what happens if we get down there and you don't have enough money for a gadget
that's a present that i had recommended
have to earn more money and what happens are you gonna buy any toys down there then
and then bring most of your money back home
okay and then go back when you had more
okay and what if you had almost enough money not quite
then will you pay me back for the extra amount that i give you
well what kind of work will you do to earn more money
yeah and what else
he said i'll help mom take out silverware and stuff out of the dish
sounds good ross

okay
okay and what about mark what is he gonna do to earn extra money in case
what if what if we
like i'm gonna pull grass
that's good you do a good job on grass
he's the grass expert
like what
yeah
okay
and you know the deal is that
we're not going to buy you any more things unless it comes out of your money from now on okay
you understand
okay
what did you say
ross
no that wasn't what you told me you said that she gave you you this
why do you need to earn the two dollars
to pay off daddy
right
which one are you
is that right
heads or tails
you gave you paid off his whole debt
i gave him one dollar cause he said he done all the books
which one are you heads or tails
he had done
and i gave him the tw the other money i wanted him to give that to you
oh but the only the dollar was part of your debt
which one are you heads or tails
only the dollar was your p your part and the rest of that money was just because i wanted somebody to give daddy the money
you understand ross
i didn't explain it to ross
well the jillions of twenties were um
he thought he was paying off his debt
ah isn't that sweet
well he was paying off part of it
how much has he paid off mom
he paid off one
okay ross explain what happened
yeah
yeah
the stiff ones yeah
yeah
yeah
oh for the bet
well that wasn't the way you presented it to me though when you came up there ross
oh you didn't understand the whole thing you think mommy didn't explain
i didn't say anything i said here's the one
well i told him he would get in real trouble if he was if he was misrepresenting
said here's the one give daddy the rest of this
i didn't explain what it was
i see
no wonder
i said it's a lot money so
no wonder he was under the impression that maybe that was gonna clear his debt so how much of your debt have you cleared ross
how much of your debt have you cleared
i gave him a quarter
and you know you do you know if if we

you know what we you know what we are doing now
what
we are not going to the policeman because we are never gonna go to the policeman

because we are not worried about those stickers

we are not worried about it mark
we stopped worrying about it a long time ago
only markie is worried about it
we took it back to the place and they were locked and closed and gone
right
and so obviously they were not looking for us they didn't know anything about it they weren't worried they hadn't called the police
so we decided that just to keep it all honest we were no longer worried we were just gonna do the honest thing send our money back
we will do that when we get to pittsburgh
we'll send some money back to them to pay for it
that's just to be honest
we're not worried that they are out after us with the police or anything
they are not coming after us
they don't even know it happened
there's no motorcycle men coming after us mark
how do i know
because they would have gotten us by now
because that's the way the world works mark

i think it has i think it has more people
and what else
well it has the same as much friends it has just one
he says he just has one friend at eastmont that's the same as much friends as at church school

when do you go to church school in the morning or the afternoon
uh church school in the morning
okay and how do you get there
i don't know

oh yeah
how come
what did that man spit
you've never seen people like that before
my bus
oh really
is your bus like that
my bus slams the door
oh is your bus driver like these people
no
okay
and what did you decide
okay
you mean occasionally
not originally occasionally
just a few times means occasionally
okay i understand
now which ones do you said often on most of them
yeah
what were some of the ch what were some of the options you had
some of the things you could choose from
no some of the things some of the activities
okay
i understand
okay
what strange things they do huh
did you tell her you wanted to learn about computers
it wasn't on the list
well if she ever asks you tell her that you need you really want to know so you can do some programming with ectrex okay
so you can program with ectrex
ask her tell her
well you have to learn
yeah they're working on it
they're working on it
believe me believe me
now okay so you did a lot time with you spent a lot time with this lady
what was her name
mrs bower
and are you gonna see her every week
is she think she'll be nice to you
i see
but every wednesday you're going to miss some some time in class
i see okay
well
gym or art i see
okay now here's the question
how come you had some problems with your work
is it because you missed regular work
okay and your teacher wants you to do it at home
okay but i have another question
okay but i have some other questions
this one she says she wants you to do it neater this time
now what does it mean you see that
you see that little red part coming out there
and you didn't fill in here
i think we should practice a little bit on drawing right
okay
not too bad this is not too bad
she wants them neater
she wants you to do a good job
now this is a terrible job
why why did you get so bad a job
why because
well but who wrote it in there
okay you missed and what happened here
you subtracted you subtracted
yeah but you didn't look at this one
there's some subtraction and some addition
that's right
five wrong
okay well look what did you do notice the subtractions right
and some of the subtractions are wrong
and there's some you didn't even do
you didn't do this one and you didn't do this one
ross you can do a better job that
i know you can
your mind should switch back and forth from addition to subtraction just like
okay do all the additions first
okay here's the trick

yeah two
what would you do with two two moms
what would you do with two moms
a what
yeah and the other one
you want the one
and know what
other one could be the maid
sounds good to me
that's what they do in some families
mom doesn't have to do any work they just get a maid
and a maid takes care of the kids
oh no
and mother spends all her time going to parties
that's true
and wouldn't see the kids any more
mother doesn't mother basically maids raise their kids
that seems so cruel
all the hard work that a mother does is try and take care of those little kids
kitty
kitty stop that
it's supposed to get markedly cooler
what did you say
it's supposed to get markedly cooler
i bet you thought i said supposed to get mark a pool or something
no i thought you said it's supposed to put marky in the pool
and
well what does this have to do with school
yeah
yeah
you have a basic problem here ross
you're too much
you are asking for b when you haven't even secured a
you don't yet have our permission to take transformer to school
what if some kid comes around and rips off one of the arms
then you're gonna be the time that um michael olah took your calculator
took it home put it under his bed broke it and we had to buy you a new one
remember the time
you lost your hood
but you could lose things too
and then there was some other toy you took once it a piece of it
the calculator wasn't loose
no they got loose after michael olah slept on it
i see no reason for him to take expensive toys to school
you promised it didn't you ross
why will they beat you to death
explain it
explain the whole deal
explain who who these kids are that are going to beat you to death
i want to know we'll report them to the teacher
i'll report on them all
i don't want get in trouble
you don't want them you
you don't want to tattle on your friends
okay then i promise i wont
okay i wont report it to the teacher but tell me who they are
i thought mike and jerry were the ones who were beating up on you
and they're friends again
jerry roman
you mean jerry roman
you know that michael and jerry are both romanian
romanian
oh yes
because one of theirs name is roman
michael jerry roman
that means he's romanian
and michael olah that means romanian in hungarian
did you know they're both romanian
i'll show you where romania is sometime
it's right next to hungary
he's been to romania
we went to romania
remember
when you almost got hit by the truck
boy
are you on that again
well we know where one we know there's one decepticon that you're going to get for christmas
so all you've got to do is wait till christmas and you can do this whole thing
now wait a minute
wait a second
are you going to take both a decepticon and an autobot
one kid taking two one kid taking two fancy complex toys
oh i'm getting out of this
he hasn't even gotten permission to do the first one and he's campaigning for the second
i don't think this is going to work ross
okay here's the deal
you've got to figure out from the other kids what they're going to bring of course because tell them that your parents say that it's not fair for you to bring all the toys
what are the other kids bringing
well what they got
i see
and
you have what
right
the leader of the bunch right
now
how's this gonna work
uh tell that it's just you're gonna have to wait until marky's birthday party when they come
or else you could have boys club a meeting of boys club and everybody can bring a transformer
you wanna do that
okay
i'll tell you what
i've got an idea
you're dead meat
okay
if you can get a note from michael and jerry if they can write a note saying
can ross please bring his autobot
okay
i want them to write notes and i don't want them in your hand
i want it in their hand
can ross please bring his autobot
okay
and then they say
mrs forno says it's okay
can they write that
says s a y s
it i t
is i s
o k
just write o and k
mrs forno says it is okay
so
no no you write it
can or jerry and steve have to write it
can ross er spike can spike do they call you ross or spike
can spike please bring b r i n g his h i s autobot a u t o b o t
okay transformer what ever

yeah
i didn't say you were good before i said you will be good
i didn't say you were good
what's the difference
um
i am well i am good right now
yes
i've cut marky's pancakes for him and he said

um
he went out his secret place
oh his door
yeah his door

who d he get
um the people that were just were not afraid
oh
he didn't get anyone
every body wasn't afraid right
every body was
and so they ran away
yeah
oh
and they drove in their cars back home
i said
oh my what beautiful art
marky had shown me some pictures and ross was downstairs hearing it and he said
and that kind of stuff
you know why
vampires are not like werewolves wait werewolves are not like robbers
or they are like robbers but just like robbers
why
because um werewolves hate the sun
they hate the sun
yeah
and and regular robbers what about them
well um they don't hate anything
they just h they hate they they don't sun or snowing or nighttime or any of those kind of days
so
or rainy days
so
that's how they're different
oh
that's how robbers and werewolves are different
yeah
their almost the same
they all they both but they both have wuz in them
they both have what
wuz in 
wuz
show me
uh tell me how
werewolf werewolf
werewolf
werewolf
werewolf
and
um werewolves
werewolves
uh and robbers
and robbers
yeah
they both have zuz in them
they both have zuz in them
zuh
yeah
zuh
oh i see
they both have a zuh in 
does that make them alike
yeah
but they're not that the same
oh
they're not the same
cause the werewolves only like it when only come up when the moon
they steal ya you or they steal your money and they walk on tiptoe
how do robbers get through windows
easy
they get a big big big rock and throw it through the window but that makes noise so the people wake up and they go downstairs and they'll find that that's a robber
robbers are very tricky
robbers are very tricky

thank you mark
do you know that song
everybody's vote
he'll go into the office and say into the presidency
well he's already there but continuing he'll say
i can do anything
everyone loves me
but what we're hoping is that mondale will get enough votes that that the democrats can look at reagan later as president and say hey you won it's true but you didn't win win that well
there are a lot people out there who don't like what you're doing an you have to tame it down
you gotta
right
you gotta do what we tell you
we're trying to represent the people and we're trying to tell you what the people out there want
now reagan won't listen if he wins too
right
well
too easily
but if he's given a little bit of a
right
run for it
i'd say also mon mondale still has a chance but it's it's a very very slim chance
pretty slim
it's pretty slim
i'm not voting for mondale
it certainly would be interesting if he won
i'm not voting for mondale
right it be a it be a real real
who you voting for mark
um i'm not vote i'm not voting for reagan
who are you gonna vote for mark
mondale
okay
who you voting for for vice president mark
huh
who are you voting for for vice president
reagan

geraldine ferraro
or
um mondale
i'm always are voting for mondale

well
i'm always gonna vote for mondale
mrs mondale
that's not
is married to mondale
but she's not gonna be vice president
geraldine ferraro
geraldine ferraro that other woman
is running for vice
she's married to um what's his name
um
joe
zaccaro
zaccaro
she has her own husband and kids
right
they're two different families
and then there's bush
y know about bush
that's reagan's vice president
i want bush
ross doesn't wanna vote for a bush
i'll betcha bet you if bush ran against mondale
mondale would probably win
i don't know if that's true
i'm not saying that bush isn't good
i'm not
than reagan
no than mondale
i sort of
i just sort of think that somehow bush would lose it
i mean stupidity has to win out
yeah
somehow stupidity has to win out
i understand
yeah
i understand
you know what they were saying uh some people were saying was that bush has basically blown it for uh eighty six
eighty
i think that happens
eight
whenever they do this hatchet routine
it's a real mistake

cheer

dole did that too

boppo right there
now why don't you stop taking it off
wouldn't that be a better idea
it just came off
well be because you're bumping it
that's why it came comes off
it's being bumped back and forth
sure if someone's bumping it
that's how these things happen
i know about little boys and the bumping you do
i've seen little boys bump around
when i was a little boy i used to do some bumping too
now a days i don't i try not to bump as much as i used to
i'll tell you what's wrong with this one
it's a little bit twisted from what you just did
it's just not supposed to move around as much as you've been moving it around ross alexander
it's just not supposed to be bumped and bruised
you're trying to release them
don't release those bat guys

i'm will to get rid of them forever then
why are you trying to bump them
why are you trying to get rid of them and bump them
yeah
at the mud flaps
the mud flaps don't get shot
the mud flaps never got shot off in the movie
they just don't
the mud flaps are part of the intrical integral part of the system
look at you
look at you
you just munching it
i saw you munch it

i saw what you did
i saw you munch it
i saw the munching
the horrible munching
actually it didn't even fall off
it just got twisted
it just got twisted wasn't isn't even broken
it got twisted
it twists a little bit
it's only designed to go up and down
it's not designed to go back and forth from side to side
okay now there's munched again
look at it
what is oh maybe it needs snapped up there
ah see what happened
it needed to be snapped up in that part
now try it again
now lay it down with its legs down and see if it folds
okay that's all it's supposed to do
just go like that
and the more you do it the more you munch it
and you got to snap it back
now that works
don't munch anymore
let em go

only worse than denver
very
during the day
where in denver it could get cold
um
at night awful cold
when you went out in denver
this is very reminiscent of denver of denver weather
when we ever went out in denver it was warm right
there was always snow
oh yeah
mom look there
your poor parents think about your poor parents children
who put all these pebbles on my floor
how come i don't have any

i think you'd better go upstairs ross i'm really serious
i think you better go upstairs she's about to blow
ross did you hear what i said
yeah its cute mark
its ross its mark not ross
ross is being okay
okay mark mommy's about to blow
you better go to your room
we don't need you to rattle our cages anymore
ya you wanna see something
i went to a fur sale
i saw jackets
um curly lamb jackets there were white blue fox ones for one hundred fifty eight
blue fox and raccoon pieced ones two fifty eight
um designer fox jackets and possum they were neat looking
two eighty five
here you can look at these
oh
go away mark
and then there were coats for a lot
a thousand you know and some but the jackets were fairly cheap
what do you need this for
well you know how i wanted to have my jacket my coat done
i went in there to see what they were doing with theirs course theirs were just lovely and all brand new fur
yeah
and they were all long fur they didn't have any karakul like mine
is curly lamb what you've got
no karakul
curly lamb looks different
oh
curly lamb's long
curly lamb was lon white too
i though you weren't going to get any more fur coats
um that was your concept not mine
i thought when we went to holland we bought those coats
well i have that those nice coats
i don't really need a coat its just that i remember i was thinking of taking the coat i have
and having it reworked
i thought we all we decided about all this that we said instead of reworking it we'd just get a nice comfortable regular coat
and that we'd end up buying two of them and that would suffice
two really nice coats
well
it would kind of do the trick
when i dragged out that one i thought you know this would be great
now i saw these prices now these aren't typical prices this is a big deal
sale um
ross do you want some fritos
go ahead
the warm weather causes a huge coat overstock
can i have some more
can i have some more please
yep
yeah
here ya you go marky
um this was at the
yeah
but i looked at these prices and i thought well if i took my coat in
and the price started going up too heavily
yeah
um
you'd better just get a new one right
i think well i i think that
i you oughta learn more about fur
i felt that these are not for you
ross ate my other ones
the fur i got
that's enough
you eat those and then i'll try and find some more
the fur i got was a dreadful cheap one
the fur was cheap right
and it didn't last very long
i really don't think you should repair it
the collar's good
yeah
um while i felt my idea for repair was good
but it had a a lot sense to it you know
but the price might get beyond um this in which case its stupid
i guess we have to decide what price
what grade what kind of fur are you really going for
would make it worth it
you know i love fur
you know also that a lot people don't think its right to wear fur jackets okay
its see it as worse than smoking
you know your attitude toward smoking in public
i think a lot people would say the same thing about having a fur jacket
who would
you would
i think i do too
dad i'm done with these
yeah i think i'd feel the same way
you sure have to get wid rid of all of my widdle little furs
i'm done with these
it seems barbaric to me
is that unnecessary
i'm done
okay now we want cookies
where ya you gonna get cookies
what
where ya you gonna get cookies
there's a big box
oh the sack
you know what i'm going to do with those tomorrow with the boys
you you threw them away you know

the birds
i'm gonna have the boys those cookies
jvk
to the birds because you don't like to eat them
well daddy took them away once so i took them out of the garbage and i thought we could want some
you know how they're in the shape of hearts and stuff
we could tie them on the bushes for them the birds
wouldn't that be cute
we were gonna do it today but i didn't get the time

and the other one was kissed by
do know why they say sunkist
they mean the fruit has been kissed by the sun from the sky

it really isn't easy is it ross
let me see that
uhoh
what
i got
does the teacher say its okay
did the teacher say its okay to use your finger
she did
well maybe marky ought to learn to use his finger
mark could you learn to use your finger
he hasn't learned to use his finger yet
he's trying though
have you learned to use your finger
not on your nose not on your nose mark
finger on the book
okay ready for rough horsie ride
okay
in the old cowboy movies they would steal people's mine rights
no no the ones where you dig for metals
how many types of mines are there ross
and what else
well there's another one you mentioned
the one about when in the old movies
the one where they have metal
they're digging up the metal
oh you mean the ones that blow up are where are the ones that blow up
right
yep
they're underground
in the mine field
yeah but
but are they real deep underground
no just a little bit underground right
what about mind storm
are all mines underground
what about mind storms
what about mind storms
what
some mines could be in space right
what about in water
could you have mine
could you mine a harbor
what is what is that
what is that thing that comes last
what do you mean mark
uh monsters
you mean in the mine storms
yeah
oh what's the thing that comes last in the mine stories
no it's the mine
no the mine layer
what do you mean
you get into hyperspace
no marky means the mine layer
mine sweeper mine layer it's the one that drops the mines
it starts in the beginning of the when you start the beginning of the game it goes bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum and it drops them all around in space right
i mean you have to clear them out
and if the even get the big guy
ya you get into hyperspace i don't know if ya you
do ya you think ya you get
get all of
can you think of any other mines
what
what if your teacher says
you better
mind your work
mind now is that like does that sound the same as the one where you dig
mind mine
i'm going if you're a miner
have you ever heard that a person's a miner
they dig in a mine
mainder mainder
there's a difference between a minder and a miner
see one of
oh
oh
oh okay
one has a d on the end
which one of them has a d on the end
umalinda
what is that honey
what does that mean
your mind
your mind and so it's not the same as when you are digging
right
it doesn't sound the same either well when you're paying attention
but if you talk pittsburgh style then it does sound the same right
it's my mind
and guess what always when i'm around and either when i'm not the trouble he blames on me
you are accusing ross of always blaming you even when you don't make the trouble
well that's true
is that true
is that why
i saw him blame me a lot years when
when when i wasn't the person who did it
how many years did he do it
uh i don't i forget
you said you saw him blame you a lot years even when you weren't the person that did it
well some years
two years
maybe like maybe four years or five years
four or five years he blamed you
maybe
and what else does your horrible brother do
that's all
no but he always talks about breaking my to
he always wants to break my toys
okay just a minute i have to get the phone
you're gonna tell me the story of you're_not_elected_charlie_brown
go ahead shoot
this is a book report
you sit on the chair and i'll stand over there and i'll pretend you pretend you're talking to the class
and tell them the whole story of you're_not_elected_charlie_brown
this is a story by
you sold out huh
and that's the end of the story
okay now who did who did lucy want to win
linus okay
but how about the other kids
did they want charlie to win
russell
i see okay
okay let's see so did let's see if there's anything else in this story russell anderson what happened to russell anderson
he lost
but how many candidates were there how many people
and so how many
no one voted for what
i see
now what did do you what is it that made
what is it that made linus lose
who won
but how come
linus won
but what did linus say that was stupid
right okay but you know something
did you how many votes did did russell get
eighty three
and how many did linus get
eighty four just one extra one
okay
so it was a tie right
that was called a tie
unless okay
okay
so what is linus can linus fix the lockers
he couldn't do them right
what did he think he was going to do
right and so he can't do it
now what about all the parts in the beginning when they have trouble with their stupid lockers
that's not so interesting yeah
i think you're right so you want to tell the whole story again one more time
yeah let's tell it one more time so daddy will listen to it
cause you have to do a real good job when you're up there in front of the class
well i think what's the most funny part of the story
i think it's when linus talks about the great pumpkin
i think its when linus talks and also what does lucy do to get people to vote for linus
what did she do
you ought to tell them about that okay
okay tell them about that so what are you going to say
how did lucy get people to vote for for her brother
and what did she do with the other kids
yanked him by his collar
yeah
yeah
yeah and one day linus had been good to him yeah
and what of the other kids what'd she do to them
chech third kid
yeah but russell anderson said
i'm running against him
so he wasn't voting but he ended up voting for him anyway
okay so that's the funny part is when and the other funny part is when linus says instead of giving a speech he's gonna tell them about the great pumpkin
and that made him lose a lot votes don't you think
thought it was funny
yeah he's a pretty good comedian
and what did lucy say
that's the worst speech i ever heard now i know we're going to win
right okay
okay well that sounds good
let's turn it off
and this is the important

fighting between harmful bacteria and my blood cells but the only fight where you get a cut and if you get a cut
boo hoo hoo hoo hoo
they're really doing that
what are they doing
they're going um
i hope they're dying because if
yeah
they don't if the white blood cells do not stop the harmful bacteria
yeah
the harmful bacteria will kill the body
you will get infection and eventually you will die
really
so it's that that's why we count on those white blood cells
don't we
that's why we can we can count on them mark don't worry

that's why they're there
do you feel better now that you know you have white
yeah

cells can change their shape
and you're a pretend you're a little bacteria

people and stuff like for example
oh
give me a better example so i can un
i
did they ask you which one is a cow and you had to circle the cow
no
mark i don't understand what the test looks like
it's all white paper and guess the
is that all you do in the test
did you just have white paper

i don't understand what the test looks like
what was the hardest question on the test
everything
what was the easiest
some some were hard some some were h really hard

you mean choose the little circle
oh
they have no name
you just pick a circle under the writing
oh
is that right
oh
yeah
o
and how do you know which one is the right answer
think in your brain
think in your brain
o
okay
well when you think in your brain can you remember any of the questions
when your brain thinks does the brain put any of the questions inside the brain
the brain is working it does some today somebody copied off of one of them
and they were both
and he had a b he had a mistake so they both got c in trouble
one boy copied off of another boy and

you wouldn't copy would you
no
i work on my own
okay
would you make any mistakes on the test
no
got alright
on the test
did you get everything right
everything right
and that because you're smart or because you're dumb

right
it makes them feel better

it's a brontosaurus just like baby
turn it off
i i'm not sure this is how ba how br size baby brontosauruses are
might be like about this big
yeah i know
baby brontosaurus might be about this big
that's not too big
mom animal of dinosaurs attack even though
it everyone attack of
mom
do they all attack
unhunh
mom
mom um the dinosaur quicksand i i mean the dinosaur quicksand you know was that mud that the dinosaurs shrink down into
that's what turned into clay n clay water
it did
yeah
in the movie
no
in reality
that that in real in the dinosaur ages there was there was um there was these little there was these blob big blobs of mud that shrinks that is deep
and even baby they these guys a ba and daddy these guys and mommy these guys every animal could sink into that
they sink into the mud
and then what happens to the mud
we well went it went uh to these guys
and what do we do with it
it it was water
no no
it became water
no we use it for oil
i mean yeah
oil
oil
oil for the car
i mean like
oil and gas
well
what do you mean like mark
i mean like um never mind
mommy these guys and baby these guys refer to the dinosaurs by the way
okay mark well
it's
what about the tar
did their animals did animals ever sink into tar
yeah
when was that and that was that in the old days
that's what i was talkin about the tar
oh the tar that they sank into
yeah
you mean when the dinosaurs sank into the tar
yeah and then we it turned wa it turned like solid
it turned solid in these days
right
in these days it's solid and you can't shrink into it it's solid
we know that we know that
it's you can't sink into it
yeah it's solid tar
you can't sink into it
like a street when they cover up the road with tar and it gets real hard
then it's solid tar right
yeah these days it's not soft tar that the dinosaurs shrinked into
but there is soft tar you can sink into still
these days
sure you can still find places to sink in
where
oh in uh trinidad
trinidad
sure they have tar pits there
they do
sure there are tar pits there
could we ever go there
would you like to
yes we could go there and sink into the tar pits
are you sure they're hiding
sure we could do it
what
are they hiding
no no you just go there and sink right in and that's the end of you
are they hiding
no
who the dinosaurs
who's hiding
are en are the pits hiding
no no the pits aren't hiding
they're all around you
they're all around you
like there's a skinny pot spot you can stand
yeah and then sometimes you'll slip off of the skinny part right into the tar pit
why
is that sure
that's for sure
no my my it should be like about this wide maybe
it should so you don't really slip in
yeah
no you'll probably slip in
no i mean like it can be this
maybe we shouldn't go there
maybe we just shouldn't go there
no i mean
you mean the car could sink too
oh yeah everything sinks right into those tar pits
is there is the road have tar pits
there's no road
it's sunk in
sunk in
you understand
i wish i was a monkey
and i could swing and i could swing across california and a across everywhere
yeah that would be a good idea
why don't you do that next time you're born okay
next time you're born you gotta be a monkey okay
no next time i'm b i'm born i i'm i'm going to be a animal and i hope i'm going to be a monkey
you're hoping
yeah
why don't you do it for sure
no hoping
just really do it
not no hope
just do it
no hope
no hope
none of that hope stuff
just do it
okay
okay but
you better let your mommy sleep now
she's very tired
okay
here turn the tape off now
know what my dinosaurs turned into
what
bones
they had bones in their bodies in the first place
i know
and then they turned into bones
they died and they turned into bones
they dried up and then their skin tore off
and the bones and the bones sank the bones were so heavy
they were
the bones were heavy
but how come dogs can hold up bones
what
how come dogs can hold up bones
they're not as big and heavy
you mean the puppy is heavier than is stronger
doesn't have heavy bones
oh bones don't have heavy bones
your doggy didn't have big bones
the dinosaur had such big heavy bones that it was easier for him to stay inside of the water so that he didn't have to carry around all that weight
those guys went in the water they were so big and they had big heavy bones heavier than that
mom
how did y
how did what
how did how can you have a different kind of mo a different kind of chi child
like kind of like a monster
how can you have that kind of child
oh that's when you have a baby that wasn't that didn't grow right
oh like maybe the feet got je like um twisted like um twisted
right
you take a cute little boy like you
no brian
and you tickle too much and they turn into monsters
no
unhunh
well how else are you gonna do it
there's one more way
what's that
how to make a monster
how
you get a dinosaur and sh and thr
you get married to a dinosaur
and yeah and th and then and then ya tear the skin off
and then you be the di dinosaur
and then you'll be aten eaten
aten
what's the right way to say aten
eaten
very good
if you do that mistake the the meat eaters are gonna get ya
the meat eaters are gonna get ya right
hey how would they know that you're alive that that thing is alive
the skin is all all parachute down it was too it would be too big
the skin would be too big
the skin would all parachute down on you because it would be too big
yeah
why wouldn't you have the bones there anymore
um
or i thought you said you'd take the skin off the bones
yeah you would take the skin off the guy
and use it
but i don't think they would try and eat you
it would all it would all
once you tape the tape it it would all parachute on
where would you tape it
where else
on the cut
you had to cut
oh tape the cut back up
yeah
and would you what would you do to the skin
oh that's when you go into
you go into it
it won't be t too sharp
a and it will be really rough to get through to cut through and to tape
the skin the ups the top skin is gonna be kind of um bumpy
bumpy
like and made like kind of like rock
oh real rough huh
yeah real rough
and once you get in you have to tape it
and i don't think that would be comfy in there
inside
yeah
so you're gonna cut the skin off a dinosaur and take it off and then c climb inside and sew it and tape it back up
yeah except you have to take all the bones and blood and veins and heads and eyeballs out
right and then
that's just it's disgusting
and then the skin is gonna parachute down on you
once you get in and tape it up it's gonna parachute down on you
now what's gonna parachute down on you
i think i shouldn't have asked
no we've got it all figured out here
is this to become a monster
is this how you get to be a monster
yeah except i don't think it's gonna be workin
why not
you would have to get a small one
a small dinosaur
yeah and that would be hard to do it it cou would
well there must be
it would and you'd know which one it would be
which one baby
no the one with the rough rough bumpy things
oh you mean like um
stegosaurus
stegosaurus
or the one with the spiked tail
that's stegosaurus
oh rough and bumpy
you might mean ankylosaurus
or or maybe that other vicious one
tyrannosaurus rex
no that that other vicious one
you're joking
do you mean the meat eater
no another of the plant eaters
are they vicious
yep they're vicious
plant eaters are vicious they hit you with their tail huh
yeah like one of them has a br
one of them are stupid
have a stupid brain
a little brain up in his head so it the tail has a brain and it can ta tell the the brain up here when a guy is comin after
and there's one with a spiked tail and one with a bumpy thing like
buzz the but there's little plates one of those little plates with those plates
lots of details
i'm sure you couldn't eat dinner on the plates
i'm sure you couldn't eat dinner on the plates
on which plates mark
the plates of the dinosaur
oh those plates
what if you cut off
then you could eat dinner on those plates
very funny dad
you would have to you would have to try it once you would get
i don't think you could be a monster that way either they would kill you
the one with the plates and the one with the spiked tail most of the one with the spiked tail
does baby have any of these things
he has
he's a furry dinosaur
baby is a furry dinosaur
dinosaur with fur you can pet him
no scale
mark we love you but there are limits
mark said
yeah limits not to go up to
not to go up to a hundred limits

nuhhuh nuhhuh i that that was make sense
what
that does make sense
it does make sense
it does ross
it says
yeahhuh
let mark say ross
it means i make i made my point
who's talking
that makes sense
that was mark
well that makes sense
and that's that does make sense and that's but that's not what you said last night
last night you said that rest your case meant that you were tired and you didn't wanna you wanted to sleep
no
i wondered if he were saying it in the past tense
i was showing mark a snoopy's cartoon
one cartoon was snoopy blew gave uh woodstock the bird a little puff of air a little blow so that he would float with his balloon
and then um snoopy lay down
in the next cartoon sloopy snoopy was laying down on his doghouse and the uh bird came flying by with a gust of wind and knocked the dog onto the balloon
and the bird stayed on the uh doghouse
and i i showed that to mark and mark said
first he helped him
then he terrorized him
um it's interesting to me because he and him changes midsentence
first he helped him
that was
first snoopy helped woodstock
then
let's see
this is um july twenty eighth ha having lunch and ro mark was trying to say how much carrots he wants to eat trying to say that he only wants to eat as much as
nuhhuh
nuhhuh
this is how low yours was
unhunh the whole carrot
unhunh unhunh
that was standing there and it was small
i didn't
he's lying
marky said
daddy come up here
i wanna uh i want you to show me something
and i said
mark uh you have to do it by yourself and just
i said
just tell me
and he said
no you have to come up here
it's a showing you kind of thing
they were from yesterday the twenty seventh
uh mark was playing with a hula hoop and he said
think of it as a giant frisbee
pretend i'm a giant and it's a giant frisbee
i was foolin around with the car and he was just out there playing
and um i was eatin uh some graham crackers
and mark uh said
are you curious how it will taste with peanut butter on it
uh he had already tasted it with peanut butter and he knew it was very good graham crackers with peanut butter
and he said
are you curious how it will taste with peanut butter on it
wanting to know whether i i'd ever had it before essentially
mark walked in behind me and said
mom i'm hungry
and i said
you are huh
without looking at him
and he said
and it's not ross who is working
it's mark who is playing
and i'm hungry
he was identifying himself he knew i didn't look up
tell ross to uh
they have underwear on and he said
oh psyche
psyche means
i don't really mean it
they they didn't really have underwear
a little bit earlier today
it's um july thirtieth
he said uh i said
don't run around naked
similar situation we were in the shower
don't run around naked
and he said uh
i don't
ross said uh
mary brought home some groceries and ross said
could you wash me a cherry
uh and mary reacted to it
and i said
why
do you think that's funny
he said
yeah i don't usually say it
you could you wash your cherry for me
and i said
yeah okay i agree
so uh anyway incorrect use of the benefactive as a direct object i guess
the verb wash
uh she was also calling the
uh they were talking about things and she was saying
you know it really was interesting that mark said about rest my case you know
this was something that was recorded i believe on the uh last tape
and she said
you know it was a perfect use of it uh rhetorically
it's just the only place where the rhetorical use and the meaningful use that is of really resting something both could cooccur
in other words ro mark didn't could use it rhetorically correctly but didn't have to use it metaphorically
uh that is the idea of resting a case metaphorically was not something he wanted to buy into yet
so he wanted to use it in a specifically undergeneralized way but still appropriate with the situation
today is um august first and uh name has come to visit
mark is dancing around to the
said
dad i'm gonna make a test and we'll see who goes past it first

i was talking to ross about um
he was actually he was asking me who is my
let's see
who in my family uh liked me the most uh was i the most fa favorite of
or something like that
and i said
well my mother
and then i said
well
no he said
yeah
and i said
no well my father
and then he said
oh yeah i remember
you told me once that you had your father wrapped around your finger
or
you had your dad wrapped around your finger little finger
you had your dad wrapped around your little finger
and this is true
but the thing is i can't remember how long ago that was
it was really quite a long time ago
um i think it was at the beginning of this year sometime or at least at the beginning of the school year
but anyway he remembered it and he remembered how to say it also
i heard mark say
we don't want no soap in the water
and ross said back to him
any mark
any
it's we don't want any soap in the water
mark you have disgusting language
and mark said
i just made a mistake ross
i gave mark a drink of water em because he wasn't quite g
well he was still awake in bed and i went in there and he asked me for a drink of water
so he finished the water and he said
thank you mom
the more i drink the more eat
with little hand movements
the more faster i fall asleep
mark was having trouble with reading some books that we got him and ross mark said
it's because uh the the words are too little
an and ross said
the reason he can't read it is because he can't see the words on the page
so my suggestion is that when he wants to read the words you write them up on a on a piece of paper so that he can see them
and what was interesting about that was this
my suggestion is
mark's suggestion is
business is was well used
it was like part of a general solution to a problem that everybody was facing at this point
actually mark's causing us all a lot problems right now
he's sort of being a little bit difficult let's say
supposed to reach something so that he can get a he man toy
ross uh that uh he was just mister wonderful just like when he was a baby
he said
mister wonderful the wrestler
uh
no no
and then he said
there is such a guy
in other words that's the first use of such in that sense that i'd ever in that specific sense that i'd ever noticed
hi rossie are you all uh set for bedtime snack
what would you like to eat
what would you like to eat honey
what
watermelon
that's sweet
watermelon watermelon and grapes
or cherries
watermelon grapes and cherries

cheese cubes
carrots all over
wow
let me put into there the most gorgeous broth in the world

transflower more than meets the eye
which is from transformer
oh more than meets the eye
you know how i got over those awful peas
you know those ones i had to eat so i could get my doughnut
i just keep them in my mouth
and what
i just keep them in the side of my mouth
i mean i float them out and put in the side of my mouth and then i got some more in my mouth and then i ate and gulped the water down
