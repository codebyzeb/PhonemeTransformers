whoops
straight into a huge
dragonfly

the sound of a kind voice was too much for wasp

buzzing angrily he dived straight at the blubbery beast as it licked its lips
in and out he darted dodging toad's sticky lightning tongue
the toad lunged back
and wasp did what wasps do best
he gave toad a nasty sting
that was enough for toad
tired and sore he crept back under his
stone
wasp's new friends clapped and cheered hooray for wasp

the three little
pigs
once upon a time there were three little pigs
their name were pinky peter and paul
and they lived in a little house at the edge of the forest
one day their mother decided they were old enough to leave home and make their own way into the world
so packing their belongings each agreed that they would build their own house and grow their own food
now pinky did not like work at all
he liked to play with all his friends much more
peter also did not care too much for work but did not mind doing a little
paul was only happy when he had things to do and was looking forward to his adventure
pinky bought some straw from mister jones the farmer
his house in no time and built his house in no time at all
he put his name on the house and stood back and looked at it
and said oh what a clever pig i am
however he did not see the wolf hiding
there
suddenly the wolf sprang out and said i will huff and i will
and i will
blow your house down
so he huffed
and he puffed
and he blew the new house of straw all down
and pinky ran away
oh no
look what he did
he's not very nice is he
no
meanwhile peter was building his house with
what's that
wood
wood
thinking he would not be too long and then he could go out and play
he hammered the nails so fast that some of them so fast that some of them did not go through the pieces of wood
he laid the roof on and did not bother to nail it down
having put only one hinge on the door he then splashed paint all over the walls and the roof
he made a very poor job of it
the wolf watched
peter at last finished and stepped back to look at his house
suddenly the wicked wolf came and he huffed and he puffed and he
blow the house down
blew the house down
the wolf however followed the pair
and arriving at paul's house he tried to get in to blow the house down
paul welcomed the other two and offered them some food which he had cooked in his new fireplace
later they decided to tease the wicked wolf
paul crept out and climbing a tree behind his roof he threw some fruit ant the beast and ran quickly back to his safe house
meanwhile paul had stoked up the fire and had placed a big pan of water on the flames
pinky and peter wondered what was paul doing
soon they heard a noise and a grunt coming from the chimney
for a moment he did not feel the sting
but within seconds the wolf let out a deep deafening scream while the three little pigs danced for joy
the wolf sprang from the hot water ran f far away
the pigs never heard again heard from the pig again
p pinky and peter have learned a lesson
make sure when you do a job you do it well
and the three of them then built three brick houses
and as they did this together it didn't take did not take too much time to finish them

my adventures with velveteen rugrat rabbit
yeah
where does it say eleanor
let me see
eleanor
good girl
there was once a velveteen rabbit
and in the beginning he was really splendid
he was plump and cuddly
and he had pink satin ears
on christmas morning he sat up in top of eleanor's stocking
there were other things in the stop stocking
for at least two hours eleanor played with the rabbit
for a long time he lived in a toy cupboard at in
and no one thought much about him
and so
found
not just to play with but really loves you then you become real
your you love your teddy don't you
are you real said rabbit
skin horse
now long ago a child loved me and this made me real
one evening
what was that funny noise
one evening when eleanor was going to bed she looked in her toy cupboard
oh here's my bunny
that night for many nights after the velveteen rabbit slept in eleanor's bed
when eleanor dropped off to sleep the rabbit would snuggle down close to her and cuddle her
with eleanor's hands clasped close close around all night long
the l little rabbit was very happy
and all the pink rubbed off his nose where eleanor had kissed him
oh no
a big person picked him up rubbed the dirt off him and took him back to eleanor
yes
eleanor herself had just had said it
he knew what skin horse had said
that was a wonderful summer
eleanor and went to the holiday house
eleanor took the velveteen rabbit on long walks
they must have been very well made for their seams didn't show
why don't you get up and play with us one of them asked
but the velveteen rabbit didn't want to
but wild rabbits have very sharp eyes
look he hasn't got any hind legs
hind legs mean back legs like that on rabbits
they're called hind legs
okay
then stretch them out and show me like this said the wild rabbit beginning to whirl around and dance
the velveteen rabbit was longing more than anything else in the world to jump and dance
the wild rabbit stopped and came so close that his long whiskers whiskers brushed the velveteen rabbit's uh ears
the velveteen rabbit cried
i am real eleanor said so
just then eleanor and ran past with a stamp of their feet
come back and play with me called the little rabbit
the velveteen rabbit was all alone
as the sun sank lower eleanor came and carried him home
weeks passed and the little rabbit grew very old and shabby
but eleanor loved him just as much
he scarcely looked like a rabbit any more except to eleanor
to her he was very beautiful
one day eleanor was v was ill
her face was flushed and she had to stay in bed
he thought of lots of lovely games to play when eleanor got better and whispered special plans in her ear
the day came when eleanor was allowed to get out of bed
the little rabbit lay among the bedclothes listening to big people talking about holiday plans
for eleanor was going away
he took he could hear a big person speaking
i think there's a good chance to sort out all the all toys
because it's eleanor's birthday on
and the little b rabbit was put into a bag
oh no
that's sad
the old rabbit in the in this bag because you were got a new one for your birthday
it's sad you liked your old rabbit didn't you
later that day eleanor brought in a splendid new bunny
when she fell asleep that night she was too excited to dream about anything else
and little velveteen rabbit lay among the rubbish and felt very lonely
aw look
and he was crying
and then a fairy came
she said i take care of all the old and worn out playthings that children have loved
wasn't i real before asked the little rabbit
you were real to eleanor
run and play little rabbit
the seasons passed
and the seasons were
what are the seasons
spring
summer
autumn
and winter
while eleanor was playing with the rabbit crept while eleanor was playing the rabbit crept out from the long grass and looked at her
one of the rabbits had strange markings
eleanor stood very still and looked at the little rabbit
why she said he looks just like my lovely old bunny that was lost just after i was ill
but eleanor never knew that it really was velveteen rabbit
come back to look at the old that child who had first helped him to be real
oh that's a nice
in your room your book down
eleanor
what did i say
no shouting
no
don't you dare put lipstick on
no
if you come in my cupboard again i will be very cross with you

one day when cody was hiking he met his friend fallow

you're the only one who can free her
i'll get her loose cody declared
let's go
cody quickly climbed on fallow's back and hung on tightly as she took off
there's some on your thumb
um cody raced over the outback until they reached the bottom of the cliff
be careful fallow called
as cody began to climb to the top
when cody reached the top of the cliff he found marrowshoot trapped in a net
she was screeching and struggling to free herself
aw
poor eagle
after cody cut the thick ropes
marrowshoot spread her wings
as she stretched out
one of her wings accidentally hit cody
he tumbled off the edge of the cliff
oh no
he fell off the cliff darling
one of the stones fell off
that's a bit dangerous isn't it
help shouted cody
as he plunged towards the sharp rocks
the great bird swooped down near through the air until she was directly beneath the boy
cody landed on her feathery back with a thud

and then what you can do is very gently sprinkle it on there
you sprinkle
sprinkle
sprinkle
sprinkle
sprinkle
sprinkle
and then what should happen is the glue and the glitter stick together
no
don't do that darling
then you'll get your fingers
just stick and then what you do
not on me
just do that
and then there it is on your card
excellent
and then the rest of it
what we can do so that we don't lose it
we can't spoil it
just put it back
