and all the way down the lane as far as the river
cried little nut
i love you across the river and over the hills

he was almost too sleepy to think any more
then he looked beyond the thornbushes out into the big dark night
nothing could be farther than the sky
i love you right up to the moon he said
and closed his eyes
oh that's far thought little nut
that is very very far
big nut settled little nut into his bed of leaves
