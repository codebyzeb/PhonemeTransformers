can you remember
when we went up to the doctors we had an ice each didn't we
yeah
and it was very nice wasn't it

because you told me to
because you wouldn't give the lady your money
you gave your purse to me
you didn't want to give the lady your money did you
can't you reach
well
she'd have bent down wouldn't she and taken it from you
she could bent she could bend down and take your money from you
if you couldn't reach up
why
because she's like that
she's a nice lady
it was a lady that served us
not a man
i'm not gonna going to touch you
it'll peel off look

don't don't your teachers take your cardigans off when you paint
jean does does she
jean wasn't there today was she
jean was jean was at creche today wasn't she

not to play
oh
why
why
because if i turn that off that willn't work
it willn't stop down now
you can't put it on
because you shouldn't be playing with things like that
they're grown things
it can hurt you if you're not careful
no

yes
no
don't bother
going to get count your money again
how many pennys have you got
you count them then
oh
don't be silly
oh
that's a death defying look
no
because it'll fall out of there willn't it
because there isn't a zip or a clasp to keep it shut
so things fall out of there easily
because it willn't shut
there's nothing to shut it look
and if you put anything in there
it'll fall out
no
don't put any money down there for goodness sake
because you'll break it

why
because it's long
