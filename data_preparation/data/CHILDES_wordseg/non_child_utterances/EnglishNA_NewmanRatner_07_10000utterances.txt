except that they have bows on them
there a little thinner
and there translucent
but they probably taste just the same
they rattle too a little bit
like these do
you do not yet have any concept of what these are used for
in fact i even have a set that has a link together like this so you can play with them
just stick with your keys
i would assume that you uh you know wipe everything down between kids

uhoh
we played with
this
the ice cream
the peas
the waffles
um
the pooh bear
then i brought out this but he wasn't that into this
and i brought out this one and he seemed more into that one
and then i we read this book
the foot book
why do you think he was more into one versus the other
i think the colors
um the bright orange i think was i probably more
interesting
and then the purple
than just this white and black
and uh he also seem interested in the eyes
on this one
for whatever reason
but i think maybe the contrast on here
was a little bit more interesting to him
than the black and white one
is he more familiar with the one word
than like meaning has he heard it more than the other
um i doubt it to be honest with you
i don't think we really have said bee more than zebra
or vice versa
so
um
but i'm yeah
i'm thinking it it might've been the color contrast
or whatever
and then
i think he was
oh i'm sorry
i'm sorry
baby
you're okay
okay
okay
and then i think he was interested in how this felt
um
the waffles in particular
he kind of focused on this one
