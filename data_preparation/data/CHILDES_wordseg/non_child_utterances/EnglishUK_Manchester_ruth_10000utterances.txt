they don't go flat
they go sit up like this
they they could be the chimneys

okay
there we go
that looks like a lovely house
look at that
one more
are you tired
are you darling
did you wake up in the night
who did you wake up
and what did mummy say
mummy said what
but did you go on downstairs
no
i don't understand that darling
i told you to go downstairs
very nice
very nice
right
there's no room
you're gonna going to break it all up now are you
well what you can do ruth when you build houses you just build round the edges and you leave a space in the middle
you seem to fill in your houses a lot
let's let's take the middle bricks away
so we can have a space in the middle
we'll just build the walls
you don't want walls
look
look
there's some walls now
see
like that
now you've got a space if little white baby wants to come in
she can go in the house like this
because she's got somewhere to sit now hasn't she
well our house is not our house has got walls
there look
see
now you've got a space for her
and the only thing is we can't find her
i don't know where she is darling
dutch baby go in there
okay
there
that's nice
i think she likes it in there does she
i think she likes it
there
you don't want a wall there
well all houses have got four walls
well well i don't suppose all houses have
most houses have four walls
well otherwise you've got a big space in them
do you not
oh you'll have no house left in a minute
because you're knocking it all down
that's right
do you not
are you building another wall
what're you building
a wee house
yeah
right
you're knocking your house down again
are you
it's a funny looking house to me
it's a funny looking house to me
yeah
it has got four walls again
they're just very low
they're not very high the walls aren't they not
imagine if our walls in our house only came this high
all the wind would get in wouldn't it
it would wouldn't it
we need the walls to be high
and then you need a roof on it to keep the wind out
yes
we've got a roof
yeah
all houses need roofs
otherwise the rain'll get in
and it's been raining a lot lately
imagine we didn't have a roof
think how much rain would be inside our house
there'd be lots and lots of rain wouldn't there
and everything would get very wet
wouldn't it
would it
yeah
has anna got a roof
anna's not got a roof on her house
i don't think she does
i think she wants a roof on her house
a roof that keeps the rain out because some roofs are very old and they leak
and they let the rain in
well there's maybe a hole in the roof
if there's a hole in the roof
it lets the rain in
we had a leak in our house didn't we
didn't didn't the water come into our room
it did
and who had to come and fix it
a man
a workman
didn't a workman come and fix it
yeah
