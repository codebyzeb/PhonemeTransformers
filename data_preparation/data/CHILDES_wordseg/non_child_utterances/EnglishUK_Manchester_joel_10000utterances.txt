you were there for like two and a half hours and you did nothing
did you play with anybody
no
no
you've got all this stuff down

why do you just ram yourself in the tiniest places
what about one of your tool kits
shall we play with one of your tool kits
joel
i'm getting a bit cross now
right
do something properly
instead of you ranting on about something nobody knows what you're on about
hey
tool kit
oh
you've gotta hammer it in
oh
daddy will've thrown it in the box
do you want to screw some screws in
oh
i can't get them out

everybody's two inches are they
you're eight inches
well
how come you're bigger than me and caroline
are you back now

i took that out
but i didn't
the hammer's missing
that's it
throw it on the carpet with everything else
are we screwing
you're mending the tellie
i don't think it's broken
it will be in a minute
yeah
right
right
you might have to do this
that's probably all the television repair does
that's what it's for
is it mended yet
what's the matter with it
it's lost it's leads
little hole
no hole
oh
you ram them in and you can't get them out again
oh
it'll sound good on the tape
should that do the trick
what happened to the end of your screwdriver
you seem to have lost it
bet it's gone down the back of the tellie
yeah
i know that should do
but there's another one somewhere isn't there
oh
exercises
oh
is that what they do is it
is that how they keep fit
that keep them fit last week did it
it's taking a long time to mend this television
it must be really badly broken
has it
oh
right
oh dear
is it mended yet
oh
what're we going to do
oh
just like that
oh
and um where would we get a new one from
yeah
well
where would we get a new television from
oh
and do you think they might cost a lot money
what
do you want your saw
everything is stuck isn't it
think your dad put these away because i can't get them out again
well
yes
i think you'd better else there'll be no videos for you if the television doesn't work
okay
yeah
is it mended now
was that you
oh dear
it must be mended now
okay
yeah
can't it
thirteen sixty eight
thirteen sixty eight
must write it down before i forget
thirteen sixty eight joel
yes
he just wanted to tell us how much we've got to leave a cheque for
i know
it can
yeah
because
it's supposed to be able to saw on here and then it chops the wood but can't
apparently
i think you have to do it across there
hang on a minute
let me
i think
definitely
oh
oh
well
that wasn't very good was it
didn't think it did it that easily
joel
oh
or is it in
oh
i don't know
too complicated for me these children's toys
i think it's supposed to be in that bit there but
i'm not quite sure how you do it
daddy'll know
oh
oh
one day
let's just hope it works now
yeah
well
it does do that
but it's not supposed to do that
oh
not on the television
you're what
you're boxing
what do you know about boxing
you've never seen any
oh
i don't want to box
oh
you want a cuddle
oh
who's a cuddly little boy
oh yes
give us a cuddle
mr welly boots
oh
don't go all baby mode again
oh
that's more like kevin the
what's the matter
oh
go away if you're going to make horrible noises
err
err
oh
i can't understand you when you talk like that
is it level
that's a spirit i think
what've you done with your other one
that's
we're never gonna going to find anything now are we
is it level
it's not level is it look
we've got a wonky video cabinet
oh
don't go all baby
you keep doing that and it's driving me up the wall
there it is
is it
are you sure
we seem to be missing one
i was gonna going to say
we can't find it
where's it gone
what did you do with it
jim bob
yeah
but there was another one
and it's gone
well
you did
because you went away and you didn't come back with it
yes
well
oh
you don't
oh
oh
look at that what you pulled off the wall
delightful
have to get that mended aren't we
oh
it's right down the back of the tellie
i can't get that until your dad gets
and that'll probably be midnight because he's gone to devon
it has
yes
well done
yes
because daddy's gone to devon
so we willn't be able to get it now until the morning probably
he will
oh god
i can't reach
oh
oh
and you got a new video last week
or did caroline see it
probably
the wombles
no
i didn't
oh yeah
not that we're watching it
i'm just saying
we got a new video
oh
look at that
can you remember any of the names
no
i didn't think you could because you've never watched it
bernard cribbens

because they used to be
once
a long time ago
what
was

you didn't realize it
when mama doris said and there's a picture of uncle tony when he had chicken and what did you say
no
you didn't
you said i don't like chicken
i like yorkshire pudding
so that's a good job then isn't it
you like chicken pie
that's right
chicken isn't something you eat
chicken makes you poorly sometimes

are you taking his clothes off again
poor panda never gets to keep his clothes on does he when you're around
lucky you only do it to toys
