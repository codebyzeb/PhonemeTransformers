well perhaps perhaps the box is too full if the bus won't willn't go in
well you'll have to move the yellow one up won't willn't you
there's no point in getting cross because there's no space is there
go on
you can put another layer of bricks on top can't you
go on
blow
that wasn't such a good blow was it
shall we try again
get those bricks out
yes that's right
what else are you putting in then if the bricks have come out
all your cars going in are they
you've dropped your truck have you
are you putting all those in the box
what's that
that's gumdrop is it
what's that
right
that's a truck that's in
what else is going in
what's that
it's not a lawnmower
that's a roller isn't it
what's this
that's a car is it
it's a racing car
that's a horse isn't it
it's drawing a van isn't it
is that it
oh that's the crane isn't it
we seem to have lost the crane don't we
what're you after aran
oh you've found the crane have you
oh you've got your box as well yeah
oh i think this crane's broken aran isn't it
that's why we took it off isn't it
oh dear
never mind
if you're gentle with it it'll stay on
but i don't suppose you will be gentle with it will you
here you are
you can put them in your box now can't you
go on then
there's more room in that box
that's the crane isn't it
be careful with it
turn yes it des does turn round doesn't it
it's so the crane can lift things from different angles can't it
are you putting the milkman away as well
well mummy'll put it back on if you bring it to her won't willn't she
right thank you
yes it's that end isn't it
it wasn't one of my better buys this was it
in fact i think you chose it didn't you
it wasn't me at all
there we are
that's the way it moves round isn't it
so the crane can pick things up at any angle
you put it in there
is there enough room for you as well the crane
well take the crane out then
you don't want to sit on it do you
you'll get daddy to stick it back
i don't think daddy can stick it back to be honest
he might be able to repair it with an elastic band mightn't he
yes well i don't think it actually needs a screwdriver does it
well put it on there until daddy comes in and then daddy'llrepair it when he comes in won't willn't he
yeah it's broken off yeah
you've done it have you
you did it did you
yeah
that's where it needs to go isn't it
i think we know what happened now
come on
what else what else are you going to do now
yes well what about your milkman or what about gumdrop or some of these other cars
oh a man goes in there does he
a man will go in there
there's only there's only your tractor that has a man on it
oh no
that digger's got a man inside it hasn't it
i don't think any of the others have got
oh there's a bus that's got a driver isn't there
i don't think any of the rest of them have got drivers have they
no
i think the man must have got out mustn't he
when the crane broke he decided that there wasn't a job there for him anymore didn't he
are you sure
well you can't go around in you can't drive around a crane that's broken can you
the man must have got out mustn't he
well you can put it in the window but if you forget where you've put it and you lose it what's going to happen
don't expect me to remember where you've put it will you
in there
is that the garage
i think you'll have to ask father christmas to bring you a proper garage won't willn't you
i should ask grandma actually
she might have a hot line to father christmas's garage list
mightn't she
come on
you've put the crane in haven't you
put it all in together in the garage
well let mummy help you then
if we move the crane to one side then
so there's a bit more space i think the bus might just go in
yes there we are
just about
oh no
i don't think it's going to shut
see if that crane'll fit round the corner
there
put the crane round the corner there
and then the bus
put it the other way and see if it fits better
oh there you are
night night bus
what
oh
i think you'll find all those things come out at the bottom if you put them down the chimney won't willn't they
oh
do they all come out the bottom
don't any of them get stuck
i think they've all come out haven't they
there's a lady
there's a brick
there's another brick
oh the red bricks have got stuck haven't they
yes the red bricks are stuck
it's because they're a funny shape isn't it
no
they've not gone down completely
all stuck
oh there they are
they've all come out
the green bricks are stuck now aren't they
you'll get them out will you
no
i don't think it'll come out will it
funny shape again isn't it
it's a bit too big to turn the corner that i think aran
there we are
green brick's come out at the bottom
where's a clean handkerchief
oh you are a horrid little boy
aren't you
that was a horrible smile then
come on
let's blow that nose never mind throwing that balloon
we play with balloons at tumble tots don't we
oh there it goes
that was you was it
will they all go down the chimney
that's the only thing that really does go down the chimney isn't it
and all the rest
oh i don't know whether that'll go down
oh yes
here we are
it's come out hasn't it
well if you want to put anything else in there you'll have to take your bus out won't willn't you
there isn't enough room for the bus if you put all the cars in is there
the crane's still in there
it's round the corner
put the bus in and let's see if we can
i don't think it will
no it won't willn't
there's not enough room for the bus as well is there
well you'll have to take the other one out won't willn't you
right there you are
you can put the bus in now can't you
give it a push
that's it
are you going to close the garage door
you've got the man out
he has to go down the chimney does he
well i think you'll find there isn't quite enough space with the little man in
we'll put him on the bus and then there's enough space isn't there
here we are
byebye
close the garage door
you want to put those in there as well do you
well i think they might go in if you put them in the bus yes
that might go in as well yes
i wouldn't put too much in
oh the milkman's got stuck
can you get it out
right
mummy's managed to get it out hasn't she
well what are you going to do
put it down again
he's allowed to be a passenger in the bus is he

just about
yes it does go in just about

so the train can pull him
yeah
look
you stick him on there and you put that on the back of the train
are we behaving
who is that
bumbo
can you do that
let's have a look
there you go
well i said i think i've lost them
yeah

another little boy might have them

um this is my notebook
well i'm sure anna won't willn't mind you playing with them if you want to but shall we play with these
look
here's that shark
that's what it did to that man didn't it
he was he was in the indian ocean wasn't he
and he was on his surf board
and the shark came along through the great waves
got his leg didn't it
and it wouldn't let go would it
wouldn't let go
it kept pulling
kept pulling didn't it
it wasn't satisfied with just a leg was it
it wanted to eat the whole of that man didn't it
and he kept pulling on the leg and the man kept pulling back didn't he
just like that it was wasn't it
just like that
what happened
did the shark did the shark eat the leg
it didn't
that's for where it fits on the lego
come on
oh look
this is where the shark fits
right
what're you going to build out of this lego
i'll tell you what
that train can do all sorts of things
i tell you what
we're going to build some shark nets here so that he shark doesn't come into land does it so it can't get men on their surf boards
take that man out
he can't drive the train
why not
is this the circus train
is it
the circus is coming to town
well all right
bumbo can go on this side
perhaps we'll dispense with the shark
shall we have an enclosure for the animals while they're resting
before they have to go into the circus
do you remember when we went to see the circus
aran
do you remember seeing the elephant outside
he was moving bails of hay wasn't he
it's a long time ago though isn't it
there weren't any lions were there
or were there
i think there were actually weren't there
there were some camels weren't there
and some horses
you lost the motor cars did you
they're in the kitchen are they
some naughty boy's taken them into the kitchen
well that's terrible isn't it
not the sort of behavior we expect is it
is that going in the animal pen
no
well that one doesn't because that one isn't a lego animal
oh is that a sheep
oh well i think the lion'll enjoy eating that sheep won't willn't it
oh all right then
are we going to have are we going to have a vegetarian tiger
that doesn't eat meat
it eats bananas
it's not
all right
that horsie's going in is it
right
is that on the circus train as well
yes
it's stuck on
that one's not a lego one either so it doesn't quite go in the holes in the same way does it
come on
shall we bring it round here
choo
choochoo
right
it's yours is it
far be it from me to interfere
it's going to get its leg stuck in the hole is it
well if you do that the horse might break its leg mightn't it
and then it'll be very poorly won't willn't it
oh
it's poorly
well shall we put this horse to lie down then
shall we make this the animal hospital
they were making an animal hospital on blue peter yesterday weren't they
well that's the cow's udder
that's where the milk comes from
it's going in there is it
are you going to put its feet in the holes
doesn't that horse ever get to get off the train
has it got to stay on has it
forever
is this a circus train or is it a runaway train
oh well if it's a runaway train it's going to go forever isn't it
whoo
all round everywhere
oh miles and miles and miles and miles and miles
pardon
it's hurt its leg
well is this one going to lie down as well then
are you going to be the vet
are you going to come and mend these legs for them
what're you going to do
are you going to stroke them so that they get better again
oh nice and gently aran
nice and gently
are you going to give them some medicine so that they feel better
that's some fish isn't it
perhaps you'd better slip some medicine in their food
put some in with their hay
what do you think
that's the medicine is it
is that the cow eating the medicine
oh
do you think its leg's strong enough for it to stand on now
oh well
shall we try
it's been poorly has it
oh is it limping
is its leg still sore
oh it's lying down in the train
is it still alive
aran
is it
is that sheep still alive
or are they dead
they're dead are they
well where are we going to take them then
are we going to bury them
well where are you going to bury them
in this box
shall we make a little box out of lego where you can bury them
somebody's been making something nice out of this lego haven't they
look at that
that's smart isn't it
is this the box here where you're going to bury them
or shall we build a box out of our bricks
that might be easier then we can put a lid on it can't we
you're making a what
a hospital
or a box
a box
right
are you putting animals in this box
our box has only got one side though

where are you taking the horse

oh it's parked has it
it's going in now is it
is this because its leg was so sore
are all the animals going in this box
there

the back door's just there is it
why don't you do a bit of building with this lego yourself
instead of leaving it all to me
oh you want to build it now

are you going to build it back up again
is there enough room in there
you've got some holes in your walls

i think they're just about all right are they
well it might go on
it might not
it might slide off
are these all bodys
are they all alive or are they dead this lot

because there's just a little bit more room isn't there
where are you taking them all
the hens have to go in
well go on
put the hens down there
right
there you are
they're all in
all aboard

why do you want to play with cars
and we went to see some cars yesterday didn't we
we went to see the sports car

that truck has to go on there doesn't it like that
so it can move it
come on
put the coupling on
that's it
shall we play meeting the horse
where are they going to
the horse is going to drive the train is he

you can't have both that and
oh come on
this is the real trailer for the train isn't it
here you are
do you want horsie to go on there

there we go
hadn't you better get somebody to drive this train
what about this little man here

or is he going to stand on the back and look after the horsie
oh the penguin's driving the train now is he
but there's two little men here
can they have a drive
the penguins
oh there's somebody else here that wants to drive
the penguins are going to do it are they
well i'm afraid he's too tall
that's the trouble isn't it
he's too tall
are you going to have one of those little men in there
that's a better idea
i think those little men'll be better at driving than pingu
go on
are you driving them round to pingu's igloo
that man's riding the horse is he
oh he's a clever man isn't he
yes he will
if you put him on right
you see he's not looking the right direction
no wonder you can't get it on
here you are
are you driving them round to the igloo then
should we make this igloo a bit taller
is that where it goes
you're making pingu feel at home are you
oh you've dropped a brick in
no wonder there's not enough room for pingu
and you want that cow to go in as well
i don't honestly think there's enough room for a cow in pingu'shouse at all
the cow's going to eat pingu
and there's a horse in there as well
did you know that
is it
going to
oh is that the shark that's going to eat dolly up

look
here's your friend the elephant

here's a little parcel
and we'll give postman pat some letters there
and there's his sack
isn't it
has he
come on
are you going to come and listen to this story and play with this fuzzy felt
well i thought it might be nice to read the book at the same time as playing with the fuzzy felt
because when we played with the fuzzy felt before it didn't really work did it
because we didn't well we didn't really make up a story about the people did we
so i thought if we had a nice story
come on
you come and join mummy
you go and look at the pictures
stop wrecking my chair as well
come on
because i want you to
because it would be nice
we're not playing at pingu now
we're playing at postman pat
why don't you go and make a picture on the board aran
come on
here's a picture of jess
oh dear aran
i think jess has got lost
can you find jess
of course you can
can you see jess anywhere here
well you've not looked very hard
i can see jess now
there she is
right
what a lot cards and letters said pat
that's because it's mother's day on sunday said missis goggins
oh said pat
i'd forgotten
i'd better get a card for my old mother
and a nice present said missis goggins
i wonder what she'd like
come on
pat was on his way
let's find his van
what color is it
it's red isn't it
and here's jess to go in the van with postman pat
and he was on the way to greevesdale farm to see missis pottage
we haven't got a missis pottage have we
oh dear
oh never mind
let's forget missis pottage
oh dear
this isn't going to work very well because we haven't got missis pottage
and we haven't got a doctor gilbertson either
so we'll go on to ted glen
right
are you ready aran
ted glen
look
there he is
there's ted glen
he's going to fix things isn't he
and what's he fixing
to give to his mother on mother's day
what is it
um i don't know
i don't know who it is
i don't know who it is
is it one it's not one of the thompson twins is it
are they the thompson twins
look
there are the twins
or are they missis pottage's twins
i don't know postman pat well enough
do you
look
here are ted glen's sheep
and they're in the way aren't they
they're in the way of postman pat's van
so how's he going to get round to all the farms and things
oh aran
don't do that
you're going to spoil them
do you not want to play with this
shall we play with your train instead
all right
we'll play with your trains
right
we'll have another go with those another time
well exactly yes
why
that's a good question
we'll have to get you some like martin had when he was a little boy
you know like there is at grandma's
you can make up pictures of your own
that's not very successful the postman pat is it
well it might be in other hands but not in yours
come on
you put the track out
well what's the train going to run on
if there's no track
well it won't willn't run all that way on the just on the floor will it
well i think you'll find that's the wrong way round isn't it if it won't willn't go on
come on
you put those pieces of track on
whoops
i think you and daddy have mixed up all these pieces haven't you
are you sure you want it like that
or do you want a circle
a circle
right well we'll have to take these bits off won't willn't we
leave that one i think
yeah
right
well you get the carriages then
are we going to build the bridge
come on
you and daddy built some jolly good bridges didn't you
it won't willn't fit together like that aran
i've told you
you've either got to have a circle or it won't willn't fit together
come on
you show me how you and daddy made that bridge
what did you use
right
you used bricks
and what did you do with them
daddy didn't let you didn't let you borrow his bricks
why not
because he was busy was he
you didn't let him play with them
oh dear
you're much better at bridge building than i am
i don't think i can do it
well that won't willn't help will it
because that's not going to make a bridge is it
you want to build what
a church
whoops
there we are
there's a bridge for you
it's not as good as the one you and daddy did though is it
come on aran
you're supposed to be playing this
what are we putting in these carriages
there's a little girl in this carriage
is she going to stay in there
right well we'll take her out
shall we have her waiting here for the train
we've taken the wrong things out of here
what are you doing to that lady
that's a lady
you know that's a lady
oh well it might be a girl if you want
a young lady or a girl
go on then
yes
there we are
that's the right one isn't it
shows that she's waiting for the train doesn't it
is that the telephone box on the station
you don't think so
why not
look
here's that lady's suitcase
is she going to have it in her hand
where's she going on her holidays anyway
why not
she can only go on the beach
well she'll need a suitcase for that won't willn't she
well isn't the beach going on holiday
oh
right well we'll have to remember that
going to the beach is not going on holiday
right
are we putting this carriage on
whoops
lady's is her suitcase going in there
what's inside her suitcase
why not
why not
why aren't i allowed to know what's in her suitcase
oh
it's knocked it over
because it was in the way of the carriage wasn't it
so the carriage just kept going
where's this train going to
where
is it going to scotland
aran
is it
are you planing a derailment
well i don't think it'll work like that
it didn't go the wrong way at all
oh dear
one of the wheels is off the track isn't it
was that what you wanted
oh don't
aran
if you do that it'll stop and you'll spoil it won't willn't it
what do you want to do
who's gone on the floor
the train
whoops
my bridge oh my bridge has fallen down
is it london bridge
why is it london bridge
what are you doing to the train
are you trying to get your fingers run over
well i'm going to build another bridge
why
because i think a train should go under a bridge
it usually gives a great big whistle before it goes under the bridge
it's going isn't it
we could have a level crossing like there is in that gumdrop book couldn't we
a crossing
there we are
oh
poor train
you've derailed it now haven't you
shall we bring this freight train
shall we
i don't know whether you can hook it up to that one
i don't think so
you can't hook it up to that one i'm sure
look
here's a freight train
coming along
what's it bringing
what's in these round ones
are these drums
what are they full of
where's the freight train going
well if it goes on to the rail track you'll have to stop the other train won't willn't you
because it will crash into it
and knock it off the rails won't willn't it
are you going to tell anna about that train that you went on at the fair
did you
what else did you go on
you want to look in the suitcase
see if there's anything in it
right
well let me do it for you if you can't do it
it's very simple really
it's just that your fingers aren't quite long enough
there we are
i'm afraid i'm afraid she hasn't got anything in her suitcase
what do you think she should have had to go on holiday
do you think she should have put a bucket and spade in there
what else
a swimsuit
what about a towel for when she gets dressed afterwards
and some cheese ets
anything else
what about a drink of orange juice
that'd be nice wouldn't it
is that what you have when you go swimming
you did get your trousers wet didn't you
what's going on now
are you going to put that suitcase back on the train
only you'll have the station master out of that train in a minute to find out what's happening
that's him
he's going to get out any minute now and he's going to say my goodness me
what's going on with this train
why has it stopped like this in between stations
because here's the station
the train shouldn't stop outside the station should it
has it stopped because that bridge is dangerous
how is it dangerous
is it going to fall down
no
you're going to knock it down are you
oh dear
oh well that's all right aran because the track's quite clear
now we've had the demolition man in the train can go in can't it
because the track's quite clear
nothing on the track is there
because the demolition man
yourself
has knocked it all over
and there's none of it left on the track
build it up again
what
so you can knock it down
i don't think that's a very good idea
which little boy
yes well
yes he has
it's a rather nice train that isn't it
is it like yours
well it is like yours but if you have a look he's done things differently hasn't he
he hasn't got his train like yours
we've lost the stop sign as well
you and daddy have mixed it all up haven't you
you've got bones and no stop sign
well that's what i'd like to know
looks as though it's gone forever if you ask me
unless that's it
no
i can't find any stop sign at all
only phone and train
where
that's not the stop sign
the stop sign says stop
just like this
oh yes
that's it
there you are
that's the right one
stop
as this train's in danger shall we take that down like that
and we'll put a big stop sign up here right in the middle of the track so that the train can't get past
see
dangerous
close the track to the train
closed the track haven't we
stop it says
the station master has to stop not doesn't he
because it says stop and the station master daren't go on because it might be dangerous mightn't it
no
i'm not surprised
oh dear me
well
that wasn't very good was it
well i don't think i'm not sure that stop sign'll go on properly
i think it'll just push it out of the way
just like that
you have to be a bit have a better stop
there you are
try that
no
that wasn't big enough either was it
are you going to put your train on there
well get it get it on the rails properly
aran
you either stop it
don't
or not
you don't hold it
what are you doing now
well i don't know that it will darling
you can try if you want
let's just try this bit like that
let's move that up a bit
there we are
shall we try
oh i think it's a bit too heavy for it to pull
it's struggling isn't it
no
i think we'd better not because we might spoil it mightn't we
we might spoil it
well i know
but it is it is i think it's too heavy isn't it
you'll have to pull it yourself won't willn't you
well i tell you what
we could unload this freight and put it on the train couldn't we
shall we do that
shall we take the passengers out
and take the luggage out
we've unloaded it haven't we
now
right
are you going to put all the freight in there
what are these
great barrels of chemicals
if you leave it open the top open like that we can get more in can't we
what's that
is that a plank of planks of wood
great planks of wood
and what's that
i thought it might be some hay or something like that
well let's try one of these little square ones
they might go in instead
put the little ones in
come on
let's put them in
oh aran
you can't put the top down because if you put the top down there isn't enough room for all the things you've put in
well that top won't willn't go down with that in will it
right okay
is that enough enough freight
where's it going
isn't it going to the chemical factory
the lady's going in too
well i don't think she'll be too pleased about that will she
it's hardly a holiday to go in with a lot barrels and things
i think the batterys are running out aren't they actually
sounds as though it's struggling a bit
er aran
if you do that the battery will not go at all
the battery will run out completely and the train will not go at all
i think all this is a bit heavy don't you for the train
shall we take some of it off
oh dear
looks as though the batterys might have given up altogether
let's take a bit of this off
and then it won't willn't struggle as much will it
is it going uphill
well i think really you need to stop it don't you when you're readjusting the er load
where's the train for this one
shall we build a marshalling yard to unload all the er
all the freight we've bought
all the great big drums of chemicals and things
should we
right
here we are
we'll have it here won't willn't we
right
come on then
well you don't need to take the train off the rails do you
what happens is that you just
no
you leave it all on the rails aran
and what happens is things like great big diggers and forklift trucks come along
and they lift these things out like that don't they
and then they store them
well i don't know where your digger is
let's go and find that little crane next and see if that'll lift these things off
i think that's perhaps the right size
is it
do you think it'll work
there you are
you can measure the track with that can't you
aunty kate gave it to you didn't she
right
come on
let's get these unloaded
here comes the arm of the
oh i don't think it's quite big enough is it
we'll just have to pretend it is
mummy'll help it won't willn't she
oh come on
the great big one
right okay
you let your crane get them out
right
come on then
that's your crane isn't it
it turns round doesn't it
come on
let's get it out
well there's the stuff in there
and there's the crane in your hand
what more do you want
that's the crane isn't it
come on
which crane
well i think we only actually have one crane don't we with a bucket like that
well which one do you want
which one
well you can have that yellow one from outside if you want
i won't willn't be a minute
i'll get it for you
is it
come on
i want to know
that's not dolly is it
no
it's not
it's empty
a
who's that
there were a pair of trousers over her face
she's wearing that because it's pretty
it's a pretty lace collar isn't it
well you take it off then
no
you've got to pull that string there
right
undo it
you can undo it
there we are
oh what a lovely dress dolly's got on
and it's just right for the sunshine isn't it
just right for the sunshine
are you going to put something else onto dolly
or is she going to go and sunbathe
well i think you have to pull it the other way don't you over her hand
that's it
are you going to put something else on dolly
yes
and what are you doing that for
she won't willn't have anything on then
oh poor dolly
i think she's going to get cold
those are her toes yes
how many toes has she got
can you tell that story about toes
excuse me
can you say excuse me
yes you can
come on
what's that story about toes
this little piggy went to market
and this little piggy stayed at home
it's not a bee
it's a fly
it's come in from outside hasn't it
well it'll fly out again so just you don't take any notice of it
go on
you tell dolly that story about the pigs
why not
don't you think she wants to listen to a story
no
you've got to sit her up to get her eyes to open
oh aran
it's only you can manage to do this
i don't think it's funny
i'm going to put poor dolly a nice pretty frock on
those are inside out

and that was our sheep wasn't it
what was this
that was a duck wasn't it
and what's that
and what's in here
and what are these
pussycats aren't they
we're going to start again are we
a
oh don't do that
what's spot's daddy driving
a tractor isn't it
shall we make a tractor out of one of these
um let me think
shall we have a red and blue tractor
there we are
put that little man in to drive won't willn't we
there we are
make that our tractor
look
we'll put a cab on it won't willn't we
there we are
there's a tractor
look
spot's daddy's driving the tractor isn't he
yes
yeah
i think so
of course there's a dog in there
we've found it several times
you find it aran
it's a black and white dog isn't it
oh look
and the tractor's got a trailer as well hasn't it
look
there's a little boy in the back of a trailer
shall we find the dog and put the dog in the trailer as well
come on
can you find that dog aran
there is one
there's the dog
what shall we call the dog
is it spot
or is it something else
don't put that in your mouth aran please
shall we call it something else
why
because it might damage your teeth and secondly people don't want to play with things that you've had in your mouth
it might come as a surprise to you but
no
if you're going to put them in your mouth then i'll take them off you
we won't willn't read the story
all right
that's just on your nose isn't it
right
what's this dog called
is it called rover
is it
or do you want it to be spot the dog
oh he's in the trailer with this little boy
shall we call him rover
right okay
where do you want that to go
well shall we put it in there like that
whoops a
and then the doggy'll be able to see a bit more won't willn't he
well i don't think you've done much damage to it have you
look
we've got out tractor
where's the big wheel
no
but this one has a big wheel doesn't it
at the back yes
where's the little wheel
and what have we got here
what's this
is that the engine
right
is the tractor going round the farm
with the dog on
what's it going to pick up
hay
is this for the chickens
well who does eat hay then
is it coming into the barn
all right
well take everything out of the barn
you take the tractor into the barn
there's lots of hay in the back is there
right
that's jolly good isn't it
are you going to take some of the hay out for the animals
who's hopping
is it the dog or is it the little boy
well do you want me to stand him up properly for you
oh he's he's he's only a little dog really isn't he
shall we stand him up there
that's right isn't it
oh if if you if you er move the tractor too quickly the poor dog will fall over won't willn't it
well because when the tractors move too quickly it lurches and people do fall over don't they
pardon
what's in the way
that snake
did you move it out of the way
you couldn't get past the snake so you had to move it out of the way did you
right
i see
oh the roof of the cab's falling off
you'd better put that back quickly
because it can be dangerous if you've got a tractor without a cab like that you know
if it rolls over there'll be trouble won't willn't there
when it rains
well if it rolls over the man the man who's sitting driving it might get crushed mightn't he if there's nothing to protect him
what is it then
we're pretending it's a what
what do you think it is

if you stand it up you can put the animals to shelter behind it in the rain

and the farmer forgot to put them into the barn at night didn't he
that's the vet

now these two pigs haven't been very well either
because they've eaten something that's disagreed with them
so they're feeling a bit sick aren't they
come on
and here's the farmer riding along on his horse
he's not a very good farmer is he
if he lets his animals get sick like this

i can see the snakes and ladders
i think i think there are a bit too many squares on there for you just yet aren't there

we could divide a piece of paper into into half a dozen squares couldn't we
we could paint some snakes and ladders on couldn't we
would you like to do that
you've got to go down because you're on a snake
there isn't a bus on it
i don't think there's a bus on there aran
it's not it's not like the one you saw on playdays
there was a bus on the one we saw on playdays wasn't there
do you remember that
come on
let's play at farmers
we can play with the snakes and ladders afterwards
these animals and bricks will be gone in a moment you know
here's this bad farmer again
the bad farmer

oh dear
i think my building techniques have gone a bit astray here
what are you sorry for
knocking my roof down
oh well never mind
we can manage can't we
the doggy can go in
well that's a good idea isn't it
he can keep guard can't he
and then if any robbers or burglars come to try and steal the animals he can bark can't he
have you put a fence up to stop people going in and out
the goat can go in
has the goat got any babys

they get very cross very quickly of you're not careful
you go into the field where they are and you're not careful and they're in a bad mood oh
they run after you
just like this
with their horns sticking out
and they stick both horns in your bottom
and toss you up in the air like that
right over their back
that's just what they do
if you're lucky they toss you over the gate
like the sound of that do you
i don't think you'd enjoy it really you know
might get hurt mightn't you
oh take that out of your mouth aran
we don't put things in mouths
now don't be silly
shall we put something else in the barn
shall we put the pigs in the barn as well because they've they've eaten something that's not very nice
and they need a bit of a rest don't they

because that's only just been born
aran

oh

okay
come on aran
come and concentrate and be a bit more sensible
shall we dismantle the barn and play at something else
oh look
the roof of the barn's fallen in
i think you'd better send for the fire to rescue the animals from under the bricks hadn't you
are you going to ring nine nine nine
why not
emergency services
which service do you require sir
go on
you tell the lady quickly
what do you want
you don't want anything
oh well
you'll get into trouble for ringing nine nine nine when you don't want the emergency services you know
i'm not ringing nine nine nine
well i would say that i wanted the fire to rescue these animals from this barn where the roof's fallen in
oh are you going to rescue are you going to be the fireman and rescue them
well what do you want to do
nothing
oh
look
do you want mummy to do it
yes please
we were having a nice game with this lot
and how did the crash happen
yes but yes but you know a crash doesn't just happen
somebody has to go off the road or something like that
or perhaps this man's coming too fast round the bend
and he goes round like that
oh smash into that one
that's a terrible crash isn't it
but we do need to send for the breakdown truck to sort it out don't we
what have you done with the top of crane
you were asking me to put it on a minute ago
well i can't put it on because you've lost it
come on then
i think we'd better send for the fire as well hadn't we
are you going to ring up and send for them
what do you dial
nine nine nine
emergency
which service please
go on quick
tell them what you want
do you want the fire
but aran
the fire has to follow the road system doesn't it
you see
and the arrows are on it to show you you see
everybody has to pull in like mummy has to pull in
neenaw
it's got to follow the one way system
neenaw
there he is
now what's going to happen
shall we get these search lights up
so we can see what's happening
is it dark or is it light
oh well we won't willn't need the search lights then will we
i think we'd better send for bernie the from the service station
he's got to go round the one way system as well hasn't he
all the way round here
only he's not in so much of a hurry is he
now there he is
are these cars crushed to bits or are they just a little bit damaged
they're crushed to bits are they
well do you think we need some cutting equipment
to get these er these poor men out of here
yes well we'll just have to imagine a cutter
you know like the one in that fireman sam book that penny has
well we'll have to pretend that we've got something like that
when you cut all the top off the racing cars and you've got the people out then they can be taken away can't they
well the people are taken away in an ambulance
go on
we'll use that as the ambulance won't willn't we
neenaw
that's the ambulance isn't it
so we put the people in the ambulance in the back of there
they'll have to go to the hospital
where's the hospital
have we got one
i think we haven't have we
so we'll have to go off the map won't willn't we
look
all this traffic's building up isn't it
all this traffic
there's a great big traffic queue
all round the back of here isn't there
there's a traffic jam
gumdrop was in the traffic jam
where is gumdrop
is this gumdrop
right
and where was gumdrop in a traffic jam
oh no
we're not having any more crashes until we've got this one sorted out
no
gumdrop doesn't crash into anything
gumdrop doesn't crash things out of the way
gumdrop turns off and goes round doesn't he
and takes a detour
shall we have this little man as a policeman waving people round the accident
so he's pointing to where to go
you see you go round him don't you over there
no
not over there
that's right in the middle of the accident isn't it
come on
you've got to go round that way there
and everybody's looking to see what's happening
right
come on then
we'll take this one to the service station
see if you can get it there
right
there we are
there we are
bernie the taken him
and they're going to put it on there on the ramp
just to see if it's worth repairing
oh goodness me
it is in a state isn't it
i think the back axle's gone
and here's the breakdown truck coming round again to get
oh that one's gone to the hospital aran
round there
the hospital's round there
and we'll take this one as well to the garage
see if we can get it repaired
that one didn't crash
gumdrop hasn't
gumdrop never crashes
there you are
that one's waiting now
and the fire now he's used his cutting equipment he going back to the fire station
he goes back nice and quietly doesn't he
all the way round here and reverse in
and so he can be cleaned again can't he
and have all his equipment checked
it's going back into the service station isn't it
right
what else is going to happen on our road system
shall we have a proper traffic jam
this crane's moving very very slowly isn't it
everybody's got to queue behind it
or better still
shall we have a bulldozer and a crane
bulldozer goes really slowly doesn't it
and everybody's got to wait haven't they
and here's postman pat
postman pat's getting rather annoyed
because he wants to get through to the post office quickly doesn't he to pick up the post
is he pushing the crane out of the way
why's he doing that
oh right
so you've used your bulldozer to push everybody out of the way so postman pat can get to the post office on time
this road system doesn't make a lot sense
it seems to me to be rather continental
everybody's on the wrong side of the road aren't they
there we are
postman pat's at the post office
getting all the letters to take to people isn't he
right
come on
where's postman pat going to first of all
has he has he got the letters for the bank
the bank manager
what's the bank manager called
mister moneybags
there we are
leave the letters
there's all sorts of things there
cheques for the bank
leave those there
go back
we'll go round here
we'll go to the hotel
what sort of letters do you think postman pat's got for the hotel
are you interested in what sort of letters pat's got for the hotel aran
or do you just want to play at crashes and bulldozers and things
i thought as much
well come on
you tell me what's happening
they're all crashing all over the place are they
oh dear
oh you always have
ask for something different
all right
right
shall we get some bags for the dust while we're here
then you can load up your dustbin cart

you've managed now haven't you
come on
come down and play please
shall we put this away then
if you don't have those barriers up on the edge of your carpark people are going to drive over the edge aren't they
well why are you playing with your petrol pumps
missis jones might want some petrol on her way to go shopping mightn't she
you get all the money and throw it in the bin
well that's sensible isn't it
why do you want to throw all the money in the bin
who can't have it
which man
all right
that's the bus driver
we can't pretend it's the security guard
i don't know where his bus is
i haven't seen it for a little while
no
i won't willn't
because i don't feel like looking for it
because it'll be a five minute wonder when it comes won't willn't it
no
we don't swing that about
aran
are you going to fill up missis jones's car with petrol
is it leaded or unleaded
why can't she have any petrol
mummy has petrol in her car doesn't she
we go to the petrol station together don't we
who can't come out
at the petrol station
what about it
you can get out and have a look at it if you want to
but you just never do do you
because that man fills it up for us doesn't he
so mummy doesn't have to get out either
because it's not a self service petrol station is it

that's a bulldozer
are you paddy roadman
breaking all the road up
is that your pneumatic drill
isn't there a hole in that bit of the road just yet
don't you think you'd better move it along a bit and have another hole somewhere else
oh no
because you don't want to take too much road up do you
come on
let's put some barriers up and make a diversion
here we are
right
nobody can come down there can they
and we'd better have one there
where does your diversion end
which bit of the road are you taking up
so it's just that bit of the road is it you're taking up
not that bit
you'd better dig that bit up aran
because people won't willn't be pleased if you stop them using part of the road and then you don't dig it up will they
here you are
here's the dump truck to take all the rubble away
what are we going to use as the rubble
you would

did you make a lot noise when you were digging the road up
oh i bet the people round about weren't pleased

and what did you tell them
you were very sorry for the inconvenience but normal service would be resumed as soon possible
right
where are we taking all this rubble

you're just being silly about it aren't you
come on
what is it we're building
it's what
there's dolly's slippers
if you push too hard in the wrong direction aran it won't willn't go on
and you know that
what are we building
a skyscraper
what is it
people don't just build on building sites you know
they are actually making something
like they're building a house
it's getting bigger
i can see that
well it will go on if you put it on correctly
no
you know that
you've got to get it on square
and who's that on the top
mister intrepid
he likes going in high places does he
well when she's stayed with us for a while
then she'll go
and then she'll come back again another day won't willn't she
what is it then
a great big tower
is it a grain silo on the farm
i thought it might be
howard harvestor
it is big now isn't it
so you've got to make that one big
well you'd better find some of those bigger bricks hadn't you
making that one bigger
a wicked snake
yeah
they're very what
very wicked
don't you think it's getting a bit dangerous that tower
no
you don't think so
i wouldn't like anybody to fall off it
i thought you were going to make the other one the same size
well i think you might find that a bit difficult
you'll have to put that on the middle bit
well wouldn't you be better with some of those larger bricks
get that green one
oh is that billy bones on the top
what is it then
come on
here you are
use some of these bigger ones here
there you are
there are lots of bricks aran
if you want to build a really high tower isn't there
aren't there
do you want me to help you
a bit bigger and a bit bigger still
i can't wait to see what happens in the end when you get right to the top
how tall it going to be when you get it right to the top
one metre or two metres
well that's a good idea isn't it
if you put it on like that it'll definitely be stronger won't willn't it
oh is it
yes
i'm not surprised
yes but i think you've got i think you've got a problem of logistics here
no
you've got round it have you
come on
let me help you
there we are
oh it is getting high isn't it
oh you might run out of bricks in a minute mightn't you
there's some behind you here
nobody's behind you
it's just some bricks isn't it
well there's some by your knee aren't there
well you've you've put must have put them on the tower
keep going
oh they're both the same size now aren't they
it's that man next isn't it
pardon
no
it isn't missis robert
that's mister scrang next
but i think he'll let you call him edward if you really want
edward
yes but don't tell him
he might be upset if he thinks he's disturbing us
pardon
he shouldn't be what
making a noise
no
well perhaps not
well he's making something isn't he
or repairing something
or maybe he's tidying something up
oh dear
shall we put it up again
there we are
it's getting higher and higher aran isn't it
do you think you can get all the bricks onto your towers
you think so do you
it's getting a bit of a funny shape this
whoops
go on
shall we put it back up again
silly mummy
well actually it would be do you think it would be better if we put it up like that
right
there we are
come on
a bit more on that one
oh which one's the tallest now
actually i think we might be a bit better on this
if you put them near to each other they will perhaps support each other
goodness me
what a lot lego bricks
that's a little table isn't it
see if it'll go on like that
oh there we are
oh even higher
it's not as big as the other one though is it
yes aran
oh you're going to have to stand up shortly aren't you
to do it
come on
you've missed out the two on the end there
that's it
i've never seen such a large tower aran
ever
a long time ago
where was it
was it one that martin made
oh
i don't remember that
can you still reach
are you sure
it's getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger
going to put some more bones on
that's fish
yeah
that's it isn't it
i think we'd better put some bricks behind that to support it like we did with the bones
there we are
and then you can put that one on top like that
oh let's just get it right
there we are
yes
it's getting a bit bigger isn't it
bigger all the time
well you could do but there are plenty of other bricks aren't there
well yes
have you got have you is the tower as tall as it going to be
are you not going to make it any taller
well he would go on that one darling
you've got to stand up to put him on
well be very very careful
you don't want your tower to fall over just as you've got it so nicely made do you
i'm not sure how he goes on
in fact whether he goes on at all
um yeah he does go on somehow
sort of in the middle i think
i'm not altogether sure
that's the video
it's all right
i don't know
that'll have to do
well because mummy can't get it on any other way can she
is that it for tower building now
yes aran
a bit bigger
and a bit bigger
well are there any more bricks for this other tower
yeah
it's tea actually
i have to call it coffee do i
okay
you know it's not coffee because mummy didn't grind any coffee beans did she
i thought you told me you put the tea in the teapot
so it's tea then isn't it
oh this tower's made
it's bigger than the other
going right past the giraffe aren't we
are there any more bricks
well they're on the floor down here
you can see them
oh
i think this is i think this tower's going to be as tall as you aran
is it
can you find me any more bricks
thank you
oh that other one's got left behind hasn't it
i don't think you can do that darling
it's going to fall over
i think it might all fall over then
shall we take the giraffe off
are there any other bricks for this tower
big ones
all right
i'll put the giraffe on if i can
i can't do it again
it's all right
i've managed now
i've managed
sort of
aran
if you pick it up it's going to fall over honestly
it will
it'll fall over
it will
what are you going to do with it
are you going to put a monkey on the top
or are you going to put pingu on the top
or are you going to have a little man on the top
there's monkey

the parrot the monkey and the donkey were all in the jungle weren't they
and there was that tiger wasn't there
and the tiger kept threatening them
but really he was quite a nice tiger
he didn't want to eat them did he
and they kept tricking him
every time he thought they were caught
every time he thought he'd caught them they got away again didn't they
and then there was that man called dry bones wasn't there
who came out of a hole in the ground
at christmas
christmas
don't you remember we went with daddy
yes
and with me
it was a sort of christmas pantomime wasn't it that we went to see
instead of going to the pantomime we went to see that
it was a magic story wasn't it about the jungle and about the animals
well he was just called tiger wasn't he
he was just like that wasn't he
a tiger
grr
no
we won't willn't
be nice to him
there was a tunnel wasn't there in the ground that they all went down to hide
get away from dry bones
you remember do you
there were lots there were lots of children there weren't there
they'd all come from different schools
put you up

aran
all these animals are waiting for you
well this giraffe wants to know how to get down off this tower
he's getting a bit frightened up there
because you see he's seven feet tall with his neck anyway
and then he's on top of that great big tower
and he's getting a bit dizzy
how's he going to get down
oh no
can't we do something nice for him
oh poor giraffe
he's another one that'll have to go in in in the hospital train
oh you've kissed him better have you
well can't he go on the train instead
he'd much rather go on the train instead of going back on that great big tower
all right
got him on the train have you
what's the matter aran
to listen to you
there's a very irritated keeper here
he wants to know who's who has caused his animals to climb these great big towers and jump off the top
he's going to be very very cross when he finds out who it is
what're you going to do aran
oh he's broken his leg
and that's your answer to it is it
well we'd better put him on the hospital train then hadn't we

out of where
here we are

he doesn't look very cross to me
and what about nicola and aran
what are they doing

why are they cross
because they want some spaghetti
well they look very happy to me tucking into that ice
oh dear
we seem to have some problems on
oh look
a boulder on the railway
nearly derailed the train didn't it
yes
carefully now
i think this train's going to be late isn't it
well don't stop it until it gets to the right stop
you're just short of the station
that's it
that's it
we've just got there
right
are you going to unload the spaghetti for bella
do you need a truck to put it in
oh the train's going without you
do you need a truck to put it in or are you just going to put it straight into bella's cafe
you need a truck
let's find a little a little truck then should we
what sort of a truck
i think we'd better have this truck
here we are
you're going to have a good few journeys though in that truck aren't you
it's not a very big truck is it
why is everybody so cross today aran
they want some spaghetti
well they look as though they're managing very well with pizza and ice don't they
do nicola and aran like ice
no
not really
and it's
look
it's strawberry ice as well isn't it
look at all these things bella's got to make some some sauce to go with the spaghetti
look
she's got some tomatos hasn't she
and she's got some mushrooms
and some onions
why
has rosa run away again
where's rosa run to
where do you think she's gone
why is he very cross
he wants something to eat
but look
bella's just given him a bag full of sandwiches hasn't she there
oh look
here's rosa
where's rosa gone
where's she stuck this time
no aran
you're being very silly
all right
well let's hope you won't willn't do that twice
it was a silly thing to do wasn't it
no
no
well nobody can eat spaghetti until it's been cooked
that's what bella does
bella cooks the spaghetti
i could do yes but i don't think i'll bother now
i think it's probably got germs on it after being rolled all over the floor by you with your digger and everything
what do you think
oh no
the driver doesn't want want doesn't want any spaghetti
not until it's been cooked
go on
you take that to rosa's cafe
let's put it in the truck
for rosa is it

you've taken it all to bella
what're you going to do about it mister deliveryman
oh

and this one
look
look at this one

and francis ford being horrid to benny isn't he
let's see what he said
he said something really nasty didn't he
that's the wrong book isn't it
do you remember what he said

oh poor benny
there it is
and what did it do
splat

the hen house has gone hasn't it
come on
shall we have a look at one of the other books

we need some other vehicles on the road don't we
i don't think we need tractors really
come on

no
that one's not alfie romeo
i thought it was that one in your hand
where are we having the canal
francis hasn't
no
francis hasn't
that isn't the duck pond anymore
we'll take that out of the way should we and leave francis there
right
alfie makes a splash
let's see what we need
right
we want benny the on the way top the car spares shop
oh well what's francis doing
shall we have him in the traffic queue
you don't want him in the traffic queue
on the ramp in the garage

ssh
it's not that funny
no
it isn't
mummy's got rid of it all now hasn't she
i'll just go and put it in the bin
now you put francis on the ramp
what's francis doing on the ramp anyway
is he having his oil changed
he's what
oh is that to get the egg off his wind
oh that's a good idea isn't it
right
there's the canal
we've got to have a bridge haven't we
i think we'll have the canal going that way and the bridge going that way
come on
are you playing
or are you playing with francis in the carwash
what are you doing
oh is francis nice and clean now
do you think he needs to go on the ramp because his brakes are hurting him
right
you put him on the ramp then
he's got another egg on him has he
where's that one come from
off the green hen
are you sure about this
you've got to put him a little bit
that's it aran
go on
that's it
that's it
he'll go through now
oh that's wonderful isn't it
how much did your carwash cost
oh
and how much are you going to charge francis to put himself through your carwash
all right
don't spoil it aran
if you do that it will break
and then where will we be
you'll be asking daddy to take all the screws out to put it right won't willn't you
no
don't do that please
right
come on
are you benny the off to get some spares
we've not got to crash yet have we
here we've got alfie romeo whizzing along
oh and the traffic's going too slow for him and he wants to get past doesn't he
he keeps looking round and he keeps looking round
brumm
and this this man has to put his brakes on and swerve
and the dust cart's going too slowly
whoo
he weaves in and out
screech
they're at the traffic lights
what's benny going to tell alfie
oh no
it doesn't happen like that
he didn't crash at all
he didn't
benny the said to alfie romeo at the traffic lights you're going too fast
and what did alfie say
no
he didn't say crash
he said shut up
he said i'm i'm going to take a short cut didn't he
and what did benny say as alfie shot off
taking the short cut
what did benny say to alfie
well that's the end of that if you've knocked benny the off the road isn't it
oh well that's very good isn't it
right
benny said to alfie no
not that way didn't he
why did he say no
not that way
what happened
you tell me
splash
he went down into the canal didn't he
he did say i'm sinking
and along came benny the to save the day didn't he
and he drove all the way up on to the bridge didn't he
whee
and he dangled his hook over the edge
and it just managed to catch it
now if you're not careful this bridge is going to collapse
he just managed to dangle it and get hold of alfie's bumper and pulled him up
and alfie was dripping wet and there were all fish hanging off him weren't there
and did he tow him back to the garage
let's tow him back to the garage
here we are
see if we can get that
that's right isn't it
there we are
are you taking him back to the garage
because his spark plugs have got to be dried out haven't they
well he's not reached the garage yet has he
oh there
there goes the bridge
oh there we are
here's poor francis
here's poor alfie
you'd better put him on the ramp so that mike mechanic can have a look underneath
well he's going up and down like a yoyo isn't he
right
we'll slide mike underneath so he can see what's happening
and then we'll get him to have a look at the engine and dry the spark plugs off
well that wasn't a very bright idea
you've gone and squashed mike now haven't you
how's he going to look under the bonnet if you do that
right
there you are
come on
we got this off the ramp
everything seems to be all right under there doesn't it
open the bonnet
dry off the spark plugs
and there's alfie just ready
i think you'd better put him through the carwash because he covered in dirty bits of water from the um from the canal
and he's got a fish sticking in him
and he's got some weed on him as well
come on
put him through the carwash
you've got to put him further forward
that's right
i think he's a bit too thin actually
never mind
he's a sports car
right
is he nice and dry and clean and fresh now
it's benny's turn
i thought he was going to say thank you to benny for being so kind as to rescue him and saving his life
is he going to
well what an ungrateful sports car
now that won't willn't go through will it
right
you put him through the carwash then
is he out the other end
that's why benny had what
benny's truck was wet
why
he pulled alfie out of the river did he
that's why benny got wet
well benny didn't go in the river did he
no
he didn't
he just dangled his hook over the edge of the bridge
it's in that book over there
i'll show you
only one person got wet
and that was alfie
look
here we are
it's that man next isn't it
there isn't a blue anywhere
the blue died
look
there you are
there's alfie going down towards the canal isn't there isn't he
look
and there he's going in the canal with a great big splash
come on
here's benny getting alfie out of the river
out of the canal
are you looking
here
look
it's alfie that's wet through
how could benny get wet
oh look
there's benny pulling alfie home
look at all the water coming off alfie
have you charged up alfie's battery
well don't you think you better had do
because if it's got wet it might not be working properly
he's going in the river again is he
who's going to rescue him this time
do you think benny wants to
build the bridge up
what about you building the bridge up
oh i thought it'd be me yes
oh right
yeah
no
i haven't got a benny the
i could get one
i think you really need a new one
that one's not a very good one is it
well when we see one we'll get one won't willn't we
yeah
you see we have got this truck with a ladder on haven't we
that's very useful isn't it for getting pussycats out of trees
where's that other one
that i pushed out of the way
oh mummy's sitting on it isn't she
this is a very good one
this one is for cleaning lamp isn't it
it's a hoist isn't it
oh who's knocked the bridge over
is it aran
or is it benny the
well how is benny going to dangle his hook now to get alfie back
what are you doing aran
come on
are we still playing with this garage
are we
or are we going out to clean some lamp with that hoist
why do all these vehicles have to crash into each other
well if you crash into benny the then there's no no getting rescued is there
because there's nobody to come out is there
come on
benny's all wet is he
well what are you going to do about it
that's alfie
right
you're going to have a look at his spark plugs again are you
well don't forget to charge the battery this time will you
no right
okay

what happens when you lower the ramp and you've got that fire vehicle under the ramp
gets squashed doesn't it
well you're supposed to be repairing these things
not squashing them
come on
you get that that car out
do you remember that other story about mike mechanic
where he dropped all his tools
and benny the
he couldn't get up he couldn't get his repair jobs done could he because he couldn't find the right tools
and benny the went out to the scrap yard and he got a great big magnet didn't he
and he swung it round the garage just like that and all mike'stools attached themselves to the magnet didn't they
so mike could find what he was looking for
that's what
carefully now with these
what are these
your stars
and what are these

come on
here's all of them
that's it isn't it
have you got them all

what do they call them
cattle mover or something
something to do with pushing cows out of the way isn't it
when you're on the railway line
and there's a cow crossing the railway line
it pushes the cow out of the way doesn't it
what are you doing
well that's the carriage to the train isn't it
that goes on the back doesn't it
no
that's the front darling isn't it
look
that's the front isn't it because that's where the cattle mover goes there
that's for pushing the cow out of the way
there's the cow look
oh
there's panda
well i think it's just the way he's made isn't it
that's the way he's made
his head turns round
oh look
here's the engine and the smoke stack
there we are
the shark is going to have a ride is it
there must be some other bits to the train mustn't there
that's a bit of the train
does that go on the back
i'm not entirely sure without a picture
is there a picture
i'm glad you were here
have you
that's nice
is that it
some thing like
oh no
mummie's going crackers isn't she
i've been crackers for a long time if the truth be known
that's it
there we are
he's found some meat in there
is he going to eat it
the horsie is going
that's only a baby horse though isn't it
that's like little bess isn't it
that you saw at the at the stables on
was it saturday
did that big horse try to eat daddy
oh they're playing games are they
that's novel
well that wasn't very nice was it
aran
aran
calm down
don't you think he'd better say he's sorry to panda for pushing him out of the car because panda isn't going to be friendly with shark if shark des does things like that
there we go
where's he hurt
his ear
oh well
there
he's better now
a plaster on his ear
i don't think it's that bad aran
it's not bleeding is it
oh dear
oh well
go on
you put panda back in his car
that'll make him feel better
because he doesn't like to be separated from his car does he
come on

oh
he's crashed into the diversion has he
well what's funny about that
that's dolly's best dress
ssh
now calm down
come on
let's build a great big tower up
oh look
there's a bit more
a bit more to that train isn't it
what are we going to build
are we going to build a farm
right
for pingu
where's pingu living at the moment
in the north pole still
or south pole it is isn't it
right
we'd better have a blue farmhouse then for pingu
are you coming to help me
pingu's igloo
is that what it's got to be
oh aran
i don't think pingu has a horse to ride
i think pingu has a sledge
right
here we are
this is pingu's sledge
that's one of its runners
isn't it
that can be the door
perhaps we'd better have a blue door
well everything in the south pole is blue because it's cold
it's either blue because it's cold or it's white because it's snowy
do you agree
you agree
well that's green
not blue
now don't throw
it's only a way of talking
well it doesn't look like a way of talking to me
come on
you find me some more blue bricks
i think this is all going to be rather difficult because i think this horse is rather tall
don't you
he's too big to ride is he
right
this is pingu's igloo isn't it
pardon
let's make what
yes
that's monkey monkey
what do you want to make aran
right well we'll put him on
don't you think it's a bit cold for monkey though by pingu'sigloo
you don't see many many er monkeys when you're watching pingu do you
just see seals and penguins
look
here's a penguin
is that pingu

well there's no room for the cows if you're going to put all that in
got to put a roof on have we
right
and the goat can go in
i think we'd better get organized and get a roof on then hadn't we
i think it needs to be a bit higher before we put a roof on
i don't think cows do wag their tails darling
they swish them to get rid of the flys
yes you're quite right
that's a daddy cow
that's a mummy cow
i don't think
is that the little cow
yes
that's the little cow isn't it
baby cow
um what do you think it's called
lynn
like that one we saw in scotland
it's called lynn isn't it
pig called lynn
no
i don't think there was a pig called lynn was there
the pig was called
one was called griselda and one was called samantha
you put your hand where
on the cats
and your hands had germs on them
did they
you had to wash our hands
all right
let's dress dolly up
what were the germs called
those are trousers
well it must have been a little boy or a little girl mustn't it
are you going to put a dress on dolly
you want to give her a bath do you
it's night time
is she going to bed
you've got to take all her clothes off have you
right
well you take them off
well i don't know
let me let me have a look at it and i'll tell you whether you can take it off
well i don't know
you can only take it off if it can be put back can't you
there you are
there's the ribbon
well where's where's where's dolly having a bath
well what shall we use as a bath
somebody like chad valley
well the toy manufacturer
the toy manufacturer
mister lego
in denmark
well if she's having a bath we could do
you've got to take her to the toilet first have you
well we haven't actually got a toilet have we
you've got to carry her
why have you got to carry her
some exercise
here you are
there's dolly's bath
there's dolly's bath
it's full of water
it's just waiting for her
what did she have in the bath with her
it bit her toe off did it
people don't usually have cows in the bath with them aran
well they're rather large
well that is exceedingly naughty
you'd better get her out and change the water right away
hadn't you
have you emptied the water out
she's gone down the plug hole
she's rather large to go down the plug hole isn't she
oh you've got dolly back have you
is she all right after her adventure down the plug hole
oh is the elephant having a bath now
well that's not very nice is it aran
elephants usually suck the water up with their trunks don't they
suck the plug hole down his trunk
well what a silly elephant
do you think he's going to choke
you've got dolly now have you
oh you haven't put hot water in
you know dolly might hurt her fingers if you put hot water in mightn't she
you've got to be very very careful about the temperature of the water haven't you
oh she's hurt her feet has she
what are you going to do
are you going to take her to the doctor
why not
isn't she that badly hurt
oh what are you going to do
are you going to bathe her feet and put some er cream on them
well i don't know about that
let me have a look
you've got to be very kind to dolly haven't you
well we've got to do it very carefully haven't we because otherwise dolly's hair'll get stuck in it
and then if it pulls it's very painful isn't it
she will
she'll cry
she goes
and all tears come rolling down her face
you can't see them but they do
there you are
yes
i'll put it i'll put it back in a moment when you've finished looking at dolly
where's that elastic band
and i won't willn't forget about it because it's tight
i'm still building this cow shed for you
and it went wrong right at in the middle
the roof fell in on the cows
the roof fell in on the cows
because i hadn't built it very well
that's why
now don't be silly
don't be silly aran
don't be silly
dolly isn't a naughty dolly is she
oh aran
aran no
she hasn't
that's not very nice at all
we don't say that
well does dolly play with with er tigger while she's in the bath
like you do
does she
does she play with tigger
and with piglet
and helen the hippo
does she play with those
who does
spot the plays with helen the
yes he does
that's quite right
moo generally
don't you think dolly's been long enough in that bath
do you think she's nice and clean
she might be getting cold if you leave her in too long
is her face clean
what about her knees
are her knees dirty
what's she been doing today aran
has she been swimming
has she got chlorine in her hair
not been swimming
you didn't
are we going to go swimming this week
why not
oh
who's going to cut it
oh are you
are you very good at cutting hair
if she's a good girl while she's having her hair cut are you going to give her a lollipop
not while you're cutting her hair
but afterwards
because she eats her crusts
you don't eat your crusts so your hair's straight
well she just opens her mouth and pops the crust in and chews it up
then swallows
well just like you do when you've got a chocolate biscuit
oh is dolly getting tired
do you think we'd better dry her off and put her pajamas on ready for bed
she's standing up on the bath
oh she'd better be careful
you don't want her to slip
has she got one of those mats that you've got to stop her slipping
poor dolly
oh ask her if she's hurt herself aran
has she hurt herself
has she banged her leg
has she banged her elbow
oh so she's not hurt herself then
are you sure
she looks a bit upset to me
is it
you cried
last week
it was this morning that
she likes to eat pigs
i think that's a bit unlikely
don't squeeze dolly's nose or else she won't willn't be able to breathe
oh aran
that's not nice
come on
dry dolly off and put some clothes on her
is she going to bed
going down the plug hole is she
well don't you think you'd better put the plug in so she can't go down the plug hole
you don't want to lose dolly do you
where will she end up if she goes down the plug hole
we'll never get her back then will we
you've got her back have you
you give dolly a good cuddle and a kiss
well she's had a frightening experience hasn't she getting sucked down the plug hole
you won't willn't let dolly do that again
that's a nice boy isn't it
what a nice boy
helen can be the plug can she
well she's big enough isn't she
she'd certainly stop up any hole in the bath
oh be careful aran
don't be so boisterous
are you being careful with that box
because you told me daddy put his shoes in that box
when i was going to cut it up for a postbox you wouldn't let me
you said it had to be kept nice for daddy's shoes
didn't you
what's the matter with dolly
she wants to stand on the bath
well i think you'll have to hold her aran
i don't think she can stand up on her own
it's too too rocky
oh poor dolly
give her a nurse
a
poor dolly
poor dolly
she hasn't hurt herself
can you wash dolly's hair
is it dry now
come on then
i'll put dolly's hair back for her
all right then
you dry her hair
just give it a gentle rub now
mummy only rubs yours gently doesn't she
well let me do it
are you going to let me do it
get her hair out of her fingers
now don't throw
thank you
oh poor dolly
there we are
nice and dry isn't it
nice and dry
right
shall we put the elastic band back on it
why not
you want to wash her hair
oh hasn't dolly got pretty curls
aren't they lovely
do you wish you had curls like that
don't you want curls
why not
well you don't have to be a dolly do you
noah at the play has curls doesn't he and he's not a dolly
he's a little boy
a big boy
isn't he
what about heidi
heidi lives next to what
billy
oh yes she does
has she got curls
no
she's got holes in her kite
did you see her on saturday when you went with daddy
yes
she was flying the kite was she
well this is something of a mystery isn't it
i don't know where your kite is
i thought daddy knew but he says he doesn't
well that can be pingu's igloo can't it
there you are
have you found i can see pingu from here
he's underneath your hand
that's a dog isn't it
what's the dog called
it comes with which man
well i don't know what that's about
come on then
this is pingu's igloo
here you are
i didn't know pingu had a dog
what's his dog called
frosty
well that'll be nice and warm for them all won't willn't it
oh well
they'll all keep very warm together won't willn't they
special fences
where are you putting the special fences
to stop anybody getting in to the igloo
no girls and no what
and not heidi
don't you like heidi
oh
that's a surprise
doesn't sound as though you do
i think you i think you're just one short aran
if you move that one up one then you've got enough haven't you to put that down like that
there's a special fence to stop people getting in to the igloo
oh well that makes it doubly safe doesn't it
stops people getting in to the igloo
stops people getting near the igloo doesn't it
are there any more
oh well i think perhaps you'd better put that one out as well
oh that's a good idea if you put it there
stops people coming from that side doesn't it
there is another one
here
are you going to put it there
are you going to stop people coming from that side
right
so the igloo's nice and safe now isn't it
what other one
what other fence
goes where
here
oh
you'd have to move one of the others
i think there only are four fences aren't there so you'd have to move one
oh is that a snake outside that's going to frighten people off
what is it then
a worm
i thought it was a snake
or a tiger to frighten people off
that's a good idea isn't it
that's tigger
he eats the snake up does he
pardon
no darling

are my flowers growing
have any of them come out
lots of them
i can only see one
what color is it
i think there's just one red one aran
i think you're imagining it

i'll believe you
come on then

did you help daddy with the wheels off percy the
that's my fingers you're banging

are you sure we've got the best tyres on here
have we
well it seems a bit unsafe to me
it looks a remarkable wobbly wheel that does
well that's not running at all well is it
i think we might have to have another try
let's have another go
no
i think it's going to be a wobbly wheel forever
there seems to be a bit more clay on that one doesn't there than there is on the others
let's turn it upright and see if it
oh that's all right isn't it don't you think
well i don't think you're going the right way about it to fix it aran
well i think brute force isn't quite the answer is it
don't you think you'd be a bit better with a bit of mechanical expertise
not again
right well is this tractor fixed then
right
are we going to have a smokestack on it
i'm not
that's the engine
the seat's up there
well it's not very useful to have a smokestack sticking out of a seat is it
yes
right
you've put it
that's a very good idea
shall we have a a nut on the bottom to stop it wobbling about
you don't want a wobbly smokestack do you
are you sure it quite needs that aran
right
there we go
well i think you are banging it
never mind can you
all right
that'll do now

oh
it's got a snowplow on it
are you going to er clear the track up to your farm

you've got your tool yes
it's got no tools in it though has it
right

half past five was it
come on

i'm not being rude farmer reed but i really think that you ought to trade that tractor in for a new model
because i think that it's not quite big enough for you
what do you think
you don't want to
wouldn't you like to trade percy the for a brand new international
a red one
what about a green one with a muffler
the muffler at the back
that magically went down
you weren't too pleased when you did it were you
come on
what's your next task on the farm then
the sheep
what are you going to do with the sheep
take all their coats off when it's sunny
are you going to shear them then
have you got your shearing scissors ready
so you're not going to do it
oh
you think that the sheep still need their coats do you
right
well then if you're not going to shear the sheep what are you going to do
what's your next job on the farm
and what are you going to do to the cows
well that's not a job then if you're not doing anything is it
how about milking them
well then you haven't got any cows have you if they've all died
what did they die of
they ate something that they sleep on

you want it to be warm do you
well what are we playing at
are you playing at pingu or playing at farms
in which case i don't need to build up pingu's igloo do i
why
how much space is there in pingu's igloo
i think we'll have to turn to yellow
we don't seem to have many blue and white blocks do we
shall we put it on here
it's easier if you put it on here isn't it
yes it is
because it all sticks together doesn't it then
well if you put it in there you won't willn't be able to er fit pingu in will you
goodness me aran
we've hardly got anywhere yet
where
here
let's have it matching
let's have one on the other side as well
on there
one there
and
build it up a little bit more
that's the entrance is it
so nobody can get in
carefully guarding the entrance are you
where do you want them
well do we not need them for the roof
oh dear
i'm not sure i've i'm not sure i've got this right
not sure this is quite how you do it
is that another one now at the entrance to stop the baddies getting in
right
that's jolly good isn't it
there we are
there's pingu's igloo
where's pingu
here's pingu
is this pingu's friend
pingo
he's going in too is he
well no
i think there are only two pingus aren't there
just two
whoops
right
well let's have a bit more on this side
well you've put them both inside haven't you
oh dear
it's all falling to bits isn't it
no well you should have chosen a better builder than mummie then shouldn't you
right
that's it isn't it
pingu's igloo
and pingu and his friend pingo are inside
are you putting those hens in there
aren't you afraid they're going to freezer to death
it's very cold at the south pole isn't it
pardon
now if you're too strong on it aran it will collapse
where do you want that to go
right on the top
let's have it
well if mummie puts her finger underneath like that then it won't willn't collapse will it
there we are
that's pingu's igloo
what are we going to do now
is this this little man that comes along
with that sort of little electric car and takes people all about on the snow
do you remember when pingu went to that sort of museum
well that picture gallery
where they had those sculptures and those pictures
and pingu and robbie upset one of the sculptures didn't they
and all that that one that was a mother and baby fell to pieces didn't it
and they rearranged it to be a horse
do you remember that one
you said you didn't like that one
you do
i thought you didn't
right
what's happening in pingu's igloo
is he having a party
why are they having a party
is it somebody's birthday
how old is he
twenty
i didn't know pingu was that old
i really didn't
i thought he was younger than that
are you sure
i thought that pingu was younger than that because pingu still goes to school doesn't he
so how can he be twenty if if he's going to school
because he just wants to
right so is he having a cake with twenty candles on
he wants to go in in the snow does he
pingo
i suppose so
if pingu's going pingu want to go won't willn't he
right
where are they going
are they going to that picture gallery again
are they
or are they going fishing
or have they got their sledges with them
are they going swimming
are you sure you get sharks at the south pole
oh you've saved pingu and pingo have you by dealing with the shark
oh i think they better go home now for a cup of tea
i think they've both been very frightened haven't they by that shark
oh
pingu is being brave isn't he
has he dealt with that shark now
has he
shall we make his igloo even bigger
think it will fall down
yes
take what
you want those bits off do you
what
both the green and the red
or just the green
right okay

oh there's a funny collection of animals in that igloo
there really is
yes
you put another brick on
yes you can
yes
that's right
yes
yes
that's a funny shaped one isn't it
oh it is a tall igloo isn't it
it doesn't look like an igloo at all now does it
what does it look like
a church is it with a steeple
now you won't willn't be able to put that on there with any ease aran
it's all going to come down

well
that's it
well it's a very funny shaped steeple this is
very funny indeed
is that the lightening conductor at the top
oh dear
oh
i think it'd be better if we took that one off wouldn't it
looks more like a crane than a steeple to me
is that
oh dear
no
you've not got it in the right place aran
as a temporary measure
well you were warned weren't you
let's start again
right
come on

how do you do
which one's this one
is that peter pointer
the hen house has fallen down has it
well you better build it up again
why not
have the hens got flattened
oh well there's no point in having a hen house then is there
if all your hens have got flattened
oh what's happened to them then
they what
they're still in the hen house
well if they're still in the hen house why haven't they got flattened
that's the hen house is it

you wash your eggs
and what do you do with them then
you bash them on the side of the basin do you
you bash them on the dog
we haven't got a dog
oh we don't use spanners on eggs at all
right
well i'll build a new hen house then if you're not going to
i can can i
you're going to let me
i'm going to have a super hen house
i'm going to have lots of perches in it for the hens
for them to stand on
i'm not sure i want any help aran
i think i could manage without help
oh it's all right
no
like what
oh this is a super hen house
lots of roosts for the hens
and lots of little chicks as well
i feed mine on corn
what do you feed yours on
oh
do you buy it from bowler's
oh i get mine from bowler's
i get these in bulk bulk from bowler's
great big sacks of it
all for my hens
do you feed them on grit as well
they do
they always eat the grit because it makes a nice shell the egg shells nice and strong
it doesn't make them dirty
why does it make them dirty
my hen house is the best hen house there's ever been
yes
we don't seem to have all the bricks anymore do we
we seem to have lost some
we've lost one of these round blue ones

this lady's waiting to go on holiday
she's going up to scotland
yes but she's going on the train
isn't she
well she's going to edinburgh
we haven't been to edinburgh have we
well we did go when you were very small
didn't we
oh could you pack this lady's suitcase for her
what do you think she needs to take on holiday with her
right
her knickers and her bag
what sort of a bag
one with all her sponges and soap and things in
and shampoo
does she need that
and her toys
yes
what sort of toys
what sort of toys do you think this lady has
it's a little girl isn't it
do you think she's got some dolls
and
yes
like me
and and do you think she needs a clean dress
a clean frock
and a clean sweater
it might be cold in scotland
what about a pair of trousers
all this going into the suitcase is it
right
anything else
hair
toothbrush
anything else you can think of
is she taking a packed lunch
she's not going to buy anything on the train then
has she got some money with her
how much
why does she need lots of money
which driver
the train driver
right
what sort of a bridge are we having
a cat's face
well how does daddy do these bridges for you
better than mummy i'll be bound
right
well are you going to build the platform up
there you are
have this very long one to do the platform
you'll need this stick won't willn't you
well because that shows you where it's stopping
you've got to
put that on top so that it shows you where the train's stopping
have you got that clock off that little carriage over there
so that the lady knows what time it is the train's going
what time is it going
what time
twenty o'clock
there's no twenty o'clock
it's either eight o'clock or it's twenty hundred hours
i don't think it's going as late as that
i think it's going at er ten past eleven ten past ten
right
there we are
that's the platform is it
and here's the lady
is she going to stand there
right
let's have a look at this train
oh well here
we've got the driver haven't we
what goes on the front of this train
isn't there another thing like that
no
the clock doesn't go on the front
this is a diesel isn't it
this is a diesel
where's that other one that goes on the front
what have you done with it
have you and daddy lost it
oh there it is
well the driver's he's just getting ready
he wants to talk to this lady first of all because she wants to make sure of which train's coming next
doesn't she
because you don't just get on any old train that stops do you
you've got to make sure you're getting on the right one haven't you
that's the right one is it
where's it going
well that's not the right one at all is it
because you've just said that this lady's going to edinburgh so if that train's going to london
do you think that train'll go through that bridge
not a hope
we're going to have to go in for engineering works on the line here aren't we
well because mummy hasn't made the bridge big enough
you're supposed to know how to build this bridge
you and daddy build the bridge together
look
where's the bottom of the bridge now
oh you've done that have you
right
can we have a couple more for this side
well we need two more of these big ones
have you got two more big ones
well shall we have two little ones then
right
here we are
i think the train will go through that won't willn't it
what do you think
you want that on the top do you
right
do bear in mind that mummy doesn't build very strong bridges darling
and if you start to press it very hard it will break just like that
do you not press daddy's bridges as hard or does he build stronger ones
well you wouldn't like to tell me how he des does it would you
well go on then
oh dear
there are definite problems with this bridge
because it keeps falling to bits
right well
that's a big bridge isn't it
oh we've got to get the carriages ready now haven't we
what's happened there
oh we've got the track problems haven't we
right
so is this the train for london
right well this lady wants to know that the train's going to stop doesn't she so we'd better have that on
what else do you have
it went
here we are
we're having a tele a telephone on the railway
on the platform
it what the wrong way
what do you mean
what's on what end
well
well she can't get on anyway because there aren't any carriages yet are there
you haven't done the carriages
right
there's two carriages
she'd better have a traveling companion hadn't she
do what grandma says
always choose a compartment with another lady in it
come on

well what was that for
well you're wrecking the station aren't you
and naughty boys get into trouble for wrecking the station don't they
are you going to wave to the driver
what does the guard make the train say when you wave to him and it goes out of the station
he doesn't say you're a naughty boy
he makes it hoot doesn't he
well he obviously thought that you'd like to hear the train hoot didn't he
do you remember
we walked up to the station to see the trains didn't we
the train came in and the doors opened didn't they
and the guard got off
and he waved to you didn't he
and everybody got on and the doors closed
ssh
did the guard blow his whistle
i don't think they do these days
no
i don't think so
and then he got back on didn't he
the train went and it hooted didn't it for you
come on then
calm down
oh what's happened now
have they got to edinburgh
engine trouble
well you'd better go and examine that engine then hadn't you
why not
it's crashed has it
well what are you going to do about this crash
you can't just leave the people there
had you better get an ambulance of a fire out
or a relief train
go on
you get a you get a fire something
or a relief train at the very least
you'll have to get something
you can't just leave people stuck in the middle of nowhere can you
have you got your fire
what're you going to do now you've got it
are you going to race to the scene with your fire
is the train on fire now it's crashed
oh
so you just need some flood lights and some cutting gear do you
are you going to cut a hole in the roof of the carriage to get the lady out
gosh
that fire being clever
it's driven all the way up the tracks
i think it's going the wrong way now
i foresee another disaster in a moment
when the bridge collapses
well we're in trouble then aren't we
we'll have to get more than one fire won't willn't we
so come on
what's this fire doing
which is the naughty way
well why is it naughty
he went the wrong way did he
right well is he getting there now
has he brought his cutting gear with him
right well get to work
are you the fireman
well i'm not going to be the fireman
why should i be the fireman
and what are you going to be
are you going to be the sleeper
are you
come on
i want some help
i want somebody to work the ladders
on this other fire that's coming up
there
i think we've got a very clever fireman here
he's got the ladders he's got the extending ladders
and he's got them onto the roof
and he's going to climb on the roof like that
and he's going to cut the roof open
to let the lady get out
he's going to undo it
he's got some cutting gear with him
and he's going to cut a big hole
they're like big scissors
and he's going to cut a big hole in the top of that roof
so that the lady can climb out
oh
well that was a lot fuss over nothing wasn't it
everybody's safe again now
gone back to the station
what about the other one
what's the other one going to do
back to the garage then
right
okay
shall we build something else to go on the track
what shall we build
a what
what does it look like
oh it's one of your silly words isn't it
i think we'll have a level crossing
what are we being so silly about now
come on
right well i'm going to build something then if you won't willn't
i'm going to have a level crossing
come on
aran
calm down
don't be silly
come on
are you going to come and play or do you want to play with something different
what do you want to play with
look
what what did daddy say about playing nicely
well he won't willn't be pleased
come on
come and play please
come on
calm down and come and play
come on
no
you're just being silly boy aran now
well i'm not surprised he's stuck
he'll be stuck on my cushions again won't willn't he
now come on
are you going to come and play or shall we put this away
do you want to play with something different
yes
he's put the ladders up to the sky
what's he done that for
well firemen don't usually extend their ladders do they
unless there's an accident
are they on a training run
is that what they're doing
training
training
practicing climbing the ladders
oh okay
do you want to play with your train or not
all right
that can be the river
you're going to knock your fire into the river are you
go on then
what are you knocking it into the river for
the what's a bit hungry
sharks
the sharks are a bit hungry
right
he's in the river now
what's happening now then
he's been eaten up has he
by the sharks
you're going to knock the sharks away
how are you going to do that
with your breakdown truck
find your breakdown truck then
now if you come round the front properly you wouldn't have these difficulties would you
where is your breakdown truck
it's lost its hook though
it's lost its hook
well i don't know where it is
right
well you'd better come down and get it then hadn't you
got it
where is it then
well you said gumdrop had got it
where's gumdrop
i think it's probably dropped off somewhere
do you think i've hoovered it up
well we won't willn't be able to find it then will we
we'll have to have a look for it won't willn't we
it's lost its hook
is it in here
i don't think it is you know
well we'll have to keep a sharp look out for it won't willn't we
perhaps daddy knows where it is
it's not there now is it
i don't know
if i knew that i wouldn't be looking for it would i
no
perhaps it'll turn up
come on
you can have
oh there it is
come on
i've found it
right
we'll have to get daddy to sort it out won't willn't we
i think it needs a pair of pliers or something onto it
there we are
all present and correct
what are you going to do
why did you need it
are you going to rescue that fire
you were going to use your breakdown truck to deal with the sharks weren't you
well you don't have to
it was your idea
has he
what's going to happen on the bank
is all the water going to come off the fire
do you think he has a fish stuck in his ladder
is it
that was a failure wasn't it
the breakdown truck pulled it out and it fell back in again didn't it
what's happening now
again
so there's not much point in him lifting it out is there if he's just going to drop it back in again
wouldn't it be better to take it back to the garage so the engine can be dried out
it would be would it
well are you going to do it then
do you want me to put that hook in the right place
right
what are we going to play with now
these
are we going to go shopping
right well you'd better get your shop set up hadn't you

he didn't have much sleep last night
did he wake up early

what was i doing

oh crunch crunch
i'll get the apple for you mummy
there we are
there's the apple
now terence is going to get me two balloons
we had a lovely balloon this morning didn't we until daddy broke it didn't he
that lovely red one that the end fell off
a big one wasn't it
that red one
well come on
give me the balloons please
let terence move the balloons
that's right
i bet sarah greeves can do this faster than you aran
sarah greeves can read can't she
oh it's my turn is it
right
well what shall i go for
oh
i might not want that
no
i don't want a volcano
i'm going to go for that clown
because the clown comes next
it's c for clown isn't it
c for clown
oh what a lovely clown
he's got red shoes on hasn't he
right
what are we having next
i think you should have a d for duck next
shouldn't you
terence is going to get the duck
quackquack
oh has that duck flown away
just as terence was going to get it as well
is it going to land on terence's bonnet
or on his caterpillar tracks
did it break when it fell on that caterpillar track
has terence got egg all over him
has he
oh
and what are we looking for now
well what do we want this for
oh look
oh to wash terence
right
okay
there we are
you'd better take terence then hadn't you
i think terence is going in the wrong entrance there darling
does terence need any diesel fuel in the back
oh well we'd better get him filled up hadn't we
is he tired after pulling bertie the out of the snow
i thought he would be
i thought to myself
you know when we went when we saw bertie the coming back in the snow
i thought terence is going to be tired after that job isn't he
there we are
there's the ramp
is terence going to climb up the ramp
gosh
this is dusty aran
because we haven't been playing with it have we
well i thought he was going through the carwash
well if terence could come down the ramp
yes
he's not as good as the other cars is he
because
does your nose want blowing
it sounds as though it does
come on
come on
you wind terence through the carwash
explain to terence what's happening that he's going through those rollers isn't he
well he won't willn't go through unless you give him a little push
i know
and have you have you got him through the carwash
has the egg come off
oh jolly good
a bit has
and again
that's it
that bit didn't
well you'd better put him through the carwash again hadn't you
are you sure you're operating this carwash properly
i'm not convinced of this at all
right
go on
has terence has terence been in
and what what do you think you're doing
aran
but terence doesn't use petrol
terence uses diesel
are you sure you've got the right one out of the right pump
because it's no use putting unleaded petrol into terence when he uses diesel
is it
are you sure
well i think he is you know
all right
you try putting some petrol in but don't blame me if terence breaks down will you
terence's driver won't willn't be too pleased if he breaks down will he
say that again
it's the what
the petrol he asked for
oh right
go on then
is his tank full
how much
gallons and gallons
and how much do these gallons of petrol cost
twenty pounds worth of petrol
got a big tank hasn't he
now had you better put him through the carwash again to make sure that egg's come off him
because it'll start to smell if you don't clean it properly won't willn't it
there we are
come on
wind him through
oh come on
i think you'd better rub over terence with a window leather
go on
i'll do it
give him a good polish
oh do you know
i think terence is a lot better now isn't he
don't you think he looks nice and shiny
no
a bit of egg on his nose
well are you going to wipe it off
has he got to go back through the carwash again
i thought he might have
here's terence
he's coming now
oh that's a modern tractor isn't it
you see terence is a very old tractor isn't he
that's why he's different
what's happening now
the tractor's turn for what
well he's not on the ramp is he
he's in the car lift
and i think he's just had a serious accident by falling off
you've got to be a bit more careful haven't you
or else you're going to get some big compensation claims aren't you
from the insurance
it's your negligence if they've fallen off the car lift
isn't there going to be trouble aran
that's not how you do it is it
you know that
well that tractor's going to be suspended in mid air
it can't get down now can it
no
nobody can reach it
it's just like that time bella got stuck in the lift isn't it
and what did they do then
can't you remember when bella went shopping
and rosa ran away
and bella got locked in the shop over night
and she thought that she could get to the entrance by using the lift
and all the electricity was switched off wasn't it
and bella was stuck in the lift
oh look
we've got it sorted out now aran
what is it you want
which car
that's ben's car and that's ben driving it is it
ben
bernie
ben
right okay
right okay
right okay
now what's that car doing
where's my little blue volkswagen
oh he's up here
here's mummy's car
can mummy come and do some shopping in the high rise carpark
and what's ben doing up there
i thought this was mummy's volkswagen
oh

robbie
pingu's friend
well that's very helpful isn't it
that's very helpful indeed
we know exactly who we're looking for now don't we
robbie told the dragon to do it did he
a
so robbie's the most important robber isn't he
he's the one that's that's planned it all isn't he
right so i think we should go and look for him first
don't you
where do you think we're going to find him
in the ditch
looking for his friend pingu

where is this ditch
is it in the countryside
near a farm

come on then
you come down and play now

well that will do
all this what's making you tired
are you going to lie down and go to sleep then
right
well i'll play with some more cars
i'm going to have the delivery van
it's going to come up and it's going to make some deliveries to marks and
is that gumdrop
well he can still make deliverys to marks and can't he
what do you think he's delivering
chips
do marks and sell chips
i don't think they do
come on
you come and play then
and beans
and here's the rubbish cart
and it's going to empty all the recycling plants that are located in the carpark isn't it
what are you going to do with gumdrop
right
he's going to morrison's because he's got some doughnuts to deliver
what sort of doughnuts are they
what have they got inside them
apple
my very favorites
i think you've had a breakdown there
you've lost a wheel
i think you need this spanner to put it back on won't willn't you
have you got your tools
you'd better put gumdrop on the ramp hadn't you
or else you're not going to be able to raise him sufficiently to get his wheel back on
do you want mummy to help
that's not the ramp is it
the ramp's over there isn't it
you know that full well
this garage is wasted on you
well if you're putting a wheel on a car you can't just suddenly pick the back up with one hand can you
you've got to use a jack or you've got to put it up on a ramp haven't you
and then you can put the wheel back on
do you want mummy to help you putting put the wheel back on
what are you getting
your tools
and what sort of tools do you need
right okay
one hammer
one drill
one set of pliers
right
you have a look close look at gumdrop's wheel
broken is it
what's happened
has the wheel come off
or is it just the tyre
oh well i think you can fix that then can't you
i don't i don't think that is what happened is it
the tyre came off gumdrop didn't it
come on
mummy's good with tools
she'll help you put it back
oh actually i think we might have more problems than first appeared
right
you're good at using tools
well if i put this tyre back in position can you hammer it on
right okay
right
it's just in position
now what it wants is it needs hammering and then it needs a squeeze with the pliers
that back wheel there
that one
just give it a hammer
make sure that tyre's tightly on
and can you squeeze it with your pliers
is that for the wheel nuts
why are you handcuffing it
oh
well that's novel
does p c know you've got his handcuffs in your tool
arthur selby
greevesdale's policeman
well can i have my handcuffs then
and you can use the pliers on your wheel
i'm not too happy about my my handcuffs being taken like this at all i'm not
i might have needed these for those two robbers that have been stealing cars from the carpark
are those the ones you repaired grandma's beads with
are you sure that's the right wheel aran
is it all done now
right
well what are you going to steal
well my blue volkswagen's never reappeared has it
i'm very
now if you pull that hard you'll break it
and then when it's broken there'll be tears won't willn't there
you can't steal petrol pumps
in a petrol station the petrol pumps are concreted into the ground so you can't steal them
well you still can't steal petrol pumps
what use are petrol pumps
what's terence going to do now
is he going to move some more of those boulders over there

poor terence
he will be unhappy if he's stolen won't willn't he
well you tell me where the keys are
well you're the driver
and anyway if you're a robber you don't need keys do you
you'll break in anyway won't willn't you
oh well i don't know what you did with your handcuff key

thought so

right
well all you're doing now is messing about isn't it
right
how are you going to make it

i know i've put it the wrong way
thank you for telling me
well you'd better find him hadn't you
well where's the bath
well bring it over here
let me have a look
i can't see him
why can't i see him
well why are you doing that
and does the soap hurt him
that's a very big bar of soap aran
are you sure it's a bar of soap
oh now don't throw it about
don't you think you'd better use one of these smaller ones as a bar of soap
give master tubby a nice wash
i thought you said he was running away from home though
you haven't finished washing him
what are you doing in there
oh dear
is it
i've got the runaway train here
with a hippo on it
is master tubby going to er join this runaway train
he's not
why not
you're still washing him are you
he must have been very dirty if you've got to wash him for that length of time
oh what a surprise
you'd better take him back to the shop and get them remeasured hadn't you
hello young man
what's the matter with these shoes
well we'd better measure them then hadn't we
right
i'll get the measure thing out
now what shall we use as the measure thing
here we are
we'll slide one of these on his feet
oh yes
he needs two hole shoes doesn't he
at least two hole shoes
and these are only one and a half hole shoes aren't they
well goodness me
are they hurting him
has he got blisters on his toes
well i think we'd better get him some boxes
let's get some boxes with some new shoes in and we'll see whether they fit then
what color shoes do you think he'd like
green shoes
i'm not sure whether we can supply green shoes
wouldn't he like blue shoes
doesn't he
oh dear
well we'll have to see if we can find him some green shoes then
right okay
we've fitted some more shoes on him
are those any better master tubby
no
well they should be because they fit you
are they wide enough
are they long enough
oh dear
well let me measure your feet again
i'm quite sure they are
well whose are these great plates of meat
oh you're master tubby
oh goodness me
well we know what size your feet are don't we
yours are ten hole feet
never mind two hole feet
i need a double measurer for your feet
goodness me aran
oh yes
you're at least a ten holer
particularly when that toe's pressed down
well master tubby
what color shoes would you like
are you sure you'd like green shoes
would you like them with laces or would you like them with buckles
like those little boots you had last winter
did you like those little boots
did they hurt you
where did they hurt you
where
show me exactly
point with your finger
that one
that big toe
weren't they long enough
well it's costing me an awful lot of money this is all these new shoes
every time you get a pair of shoes on your feet you say they don't fit you
what about those wellingtons
do they fit you
where do they hurt you
in the body of the shoe
are they all right on your legs
a little boy
well i don't know who he is
it could be you yes
have we finished measuring feet then and getting new shoes
get the what
it's over here isn't it
what are we going to build
a barn
what color are we going to have
what color are barns
they're usually red barns aren't they with yellow roofs
shall we have a red barn
well that's blue
now if you do four sides like that how's anybody going to get in
well come on
you know how to put a roof on
daddy's showed you how to put a roof on
last time you played with him
you're always putting roofs on things and building things aren't you
those are the steps up
well i'm not sure that farmers usually have steps up to the barn
because aran if you have steps up to the barn how's the tractor going to drive in
right okay
i don't think that's very sensible though
do you
i don't believe that for one minute
you're very good at saying people have told you to do things aren't you
i reckon that was a porkie
is it
no
well course not
course not
my son wouldn't tell a porkie would he
no
you wouldn't tell a story would you
this seems to me to be a very funny barn
well there seem to be more things in it than out
come on
we need some more of these big bricks don't we to make a roof
have you got any more big bricks
oh there's a white one
well we haven't got much a roof really today have we
because it's broken now
oh dear
it's falling to pieces isn't it
perhaps if we did it that way instead
maybe a little bit
oh dear
all falling to bits now isn't it
like china clay
what's like china clay
why
does china clay break easily
is it china clay that thomas the carries
oh i thought so
to the harbor
and his trucks
do his trucks behave themselves
do they
that's not very nice is it
poor thomas
does he get bruises on the back of his er fenders
oh dear
poor thomas
what are we doing now
you're making a garage so the trucks don't get him
oh put that back
drybones
drybone's train
so what is this
is it a barn or is it an engine shed
right
where's the engine going
right well we'll have to take these bits out won't willn't we
come on
put the engine in
oh nearly nearly nearly
it's still there
yes
it will go in won't willn't it
we'll put that on
now what a smashing engine shed
put those round the side
you can build it up a bit more
that's to stop baddies is it
well what do you think the baddies are going to do to the train
steal it
goodness me
don't you think somebody would notice if they tried to steal a train
he's what
what's very old
is it
very rusty
are you going to clean it up
it belonged to me a very long time ago did it
oh
how long ago
when i was a little girl
are you sure
are you sure it wasn't daddy's and not mine
oh well i don't remember it
at one time it used to be mine did it
well i the only train there was a grandma's was uncle john's
no
uncle john took it with him when he got married
because he finds it impossible to be separated from his toys
yes
nicola's got some toys
some of martin's toys were uncle john's at one time
well uncle john gave them to martin didn't he
whoops
make the back safe
he's what
they can get into it there can they
they can't
all right
goodness me
haven't we got a smashing engine shed here
no
i don't think drybones would be able to steal an engine would he
no
he can't
yes
we put those there so he can't steal it
he'll think we've been very clever won't willn't he
protecting his engine
can i
right
and what's your name
you're the guard
oh good morning mister guard
look at this engine shed
isn't it a fine engine shed
my engine's right inside and it's very safe and it's got all these barriers round to stop robbers getting in to steal it
has it got a window
where
oh yes
it has hasn't it
do you think that window was a good idea
somebody might climb in through that window
right
so they can't climb in

what's very big
the engine shed

a very old one
is that bit of the shed falling to pieces
looks a bit wobbly doesn't it
and if you wobble it something's bound to fall down isn't it
oh dear
that bit's fallen off hasn't it
that bit
where are you going to put it now so it's safe
well that bit's fallen down now hasn't it
shall we repair it again
what a disaster with the engine shed

goodness me
oh what a naughty man
oh well it's no use stealing a steam train if you're going to break it is it
come on

where are the tracks
well then it's very difficult to steal isn't it
now don't be silly about it mister robber

i'll make a really good job of it
well i was going to steal it you see wasn't i
well i fancied having a train in my back garden

which bit's broken
do you do anything else apart from repairing metal mister farrier
don't you
