this one has lots and lots of animals
that's why i thought you might like it best

like this is a pink pig
what they do
are you gonna put them all back in the farm
yep
woof woof
yep
yep i see the problem
there ya go sweetie
these are green beans
i don't think they go on the farm
where do you think they go
you think on the stove
yeah
oh you just dumped them all back out
did you want me to zip this up so its a better box
or did you want it out so that by the big red barn there's a great green field
you're switchin to food
be careful after you turn the stove on it might be hot
chili pepper are spicy
just a different kind of hot
i do not know what that is but i think it might be peanut butter
bless you
poor little thing
can you come over closer
thanks
okay
on your lip
thank you
yeah i know i'm gettin it
sorry about that
is that okay
one little tiny piece left but i think it's okay
here i'll get it
there we go okay
okay
um
do you see anything that looks good enough to eat for lunch
or do we need to go to taco bell
no d that's a peanut butter taste good
what do you like
do y if you were gonna pick stuff for lunch what would you pick
or do you just wanna cook for someone else
that is a beet
i bet you've never seen one of those before
all this food is fake though kiddo
every last thing here is made out of plastic
so it all tastes well kind of yucky
look there's a mushroom
did we have mushrooms in our eggs last night
ahhah look
i know you like that stuff
but remember that one's fake
yeah
that's a cone
the best thing to put in a cone is ice cream
and yum yum yum
oh look pickle slices
i wonder if there's a hamburger around here somewhere to put the pickle slices on
there's a bun
there's a piece of cheese
that's a piece of cheese too we can do double cheese sandwich
there's a hamburger
look hamburger cheese pickles
and a sesame seed bun
that is a screwdriver
its a tool
it is not a kitchen tool but it is a tool
there's the pan
oh this is vanilla ice cream
i thought it was mashed potatoes
i think its too big for the cone let's see
not really
don't that look like a delicious ice cream cone
even though it isn't
even though its fake
i'm sorry i think i keep faking you out by telling you about things like delicious
what's that
it's a kiwi
oh and you ate this last night too i think this is tunafish
yeah that's exactly what it says on the bottom
real food doesn't tell you what it is on the bottom
yep you're putting the ice cream back on the cone
excuse me
yeah it doesn't stay on the cone
that's actually the problem with real ice cream too you have to be really careful to keep it on the cone it's not easy
but this is even harder than with real ice cream
are you sure
yeah okay
excellent
cupcake
how many cupcakes did you have on your birthday
do you remember
oh oh oh that one might stay on the cone
try putting that ice cream on this cone
the one you just picked up
renee the white one
more cupcake
yummy yummy cupcake
can you make the yummy yummy noise
i think she's gonna share her cupcake with you
ice cream cone
see how it stays better
it still doesn't stay perfectly
whoosh but it stays much better
i think the other ice cream is supposed to be in a dish
and this ice cream is made for the cone
oh you got ice cream
renee did you see all those toys
more toys to play with
yeah
more kleenex to play with
do you remember where it is

mkay
renee do ya wanna try one of the puzzles

bless you
yep very good
wipe your nose again before you throw that away yeah perfect
no yes

do you wanna put the food back in the shopping basket and then do a puzzle
no you wanna eat the yummy ice cream more
yeah
she sometimes says no when we ask her to share her food
especially chocolate right renee
thank you here hop down let's take your chair over there
thank you oh you're gonna hold to it
we just want you to hop off of it
oh you're bringing the other chair over too
is it alright if i lift it over the toys for you to the empty spot
yeah may i please
tha
okay what's that
is that a tutu
could it be
renee takes ballet
is it
it is yeah this is a skirt
we could try do ya wanna try to put it on the girl
let me see is that a little pink leotard too
oh it is
now i don't know if its the right size for this doll
but we're about to find out
let's see if the tutu fits her
yeah she's wearing shoeies
yeah what d ya think just the scoopneck is it a scoop neck or a scoop back
i'm guessing back just by the way it's cut in front but i'm not sure
you wanna do it
okay now is she wearing ballet slippers
umhum um actually most ballet slippers don't have racing stripes on the side
and most tutus don't have to go on over shoes with racing stripes on the side
but let's see if we can do it if we did one foot we can probably do the other one
okay
now comes the moment of truth does it fit
ah maybe not
or maybe it just need to come down first
ah you know what
i think we're gonna get it on her
but it doesn't look quite right without the skirt does it
do you want the skirt on her
is she a ballerina like you now

here this is the one you can't remember the name of
giraffe
not a grandma
it's a giraffe
giraffe

okay who do you think
this is water
who do you think goes in the water
do you think the elephant goes in the water
did you know that elephants can swim
did you know that
they can swim between islands
it's crazy to watch elephants swim
they swim and they stick their trunks up and all that sticks up are a little bit of their heads and their trunks

it's okay
um so could you about what you guys played with today
um we played with the food
he likes to do the imitation play
and uh the baby dolls
does he have any of this kind of stuff at home
um we have some food not we have like a little kitchen but not that much food i guess
or we just don't take it out
um but uh baby dolls he plays with at my mom's sometimes
but we don't have those at home
like he was dressing it a little bit does he like to do that
well we have um two nieces also
the he plays with a lot so he gets very exposed to the baby dolls with them
um and uh he seemed to have a good time
he was imitating the eating and feeding the little doll too
um very uh determined to get the shoes on
yeah he was trying to dress the doll too i think right
can he put his own on now yes that's good
sort of yeah he um
it depends on what they are
obviously the velcro's easier
yeah
but he get uh usually will put on everyone else's shoes
so um he likes that
yeah
and um has has he ever seen any of these foods in real life or does he like eat any of these foods
the um the rice balls the sushi
we eat those a lot he eats a lot of rice
so that's why the ice cream i said was rice for ice cream
yeah
i'll pick it up
um and uh hot dogs and pizza we have
and juice he loves
um and i let him play with pots and pans at home so
that's normal
does he try to help you cook at all
um yes
or like help you in the kitchen
yes he likes to stand we pull up a chair so he can stand there and watch what we're doing he wants to see in in the cooking process
yeah
he likes to know how things work if he can figure things out
yeah he was really good um with like you with like the screw earlier and um
he can unscrew anything
yeah some kids can't do that but he was really and he liked
but we have to take the doorknobs off
i mean you know the cabinet things
he likes um what was it oh and the and the little um when we were making the necklace
yeah
he was really into that too
he uh he plays with legos with his brother so he i guess he's use to um using some smaller things that maybe most kids his age might not be exposed to yet
yeah
yeah those beads are little so some kids kinda they just keep droppin and he's good at it yeah
he he likes little things
he likes he loves his pockets
he um likes to put anything in them his hands too
yup
he he loves his pockets
my mom just made him uh all kinds of shirts with big pockets in them
stuff yeah he was stuffin the money in earlier
that's so funny does he like to hold that like at home he'll just like stuff like money in his in his pocket or something or is that like
yeah
yeah he'll find a coin and he'll he'll carry it around
um or he'll go and put it in his own thing
yup
oh yeah cause he was good at that too like putting his stuff in the
he's very deter he likes things to be put where they go
he's a little his chair he wanted it just so
oh that's oh that's what he was kinda squished like kinda make it okay yeah
um was there anything that he didn't seem to be interested in that you tried to get him to play with or that he just didn't
um
well we didn't play with the little animals at all
he probably would if i um encouraged him but he seemed to more excited with the food
um the book i was impressed with
really he doesn't that was the longest he sat still for it
yeah
he did good
and i know the juice was there too but um
it seemed like he was listening
yeah no i think he liked it
i mean he was getting a little bit but
he seemed to enjoy it
d you think he's seen any of these animals or before or like you guys go to the zoo or like the aquarium
um not too much
but i guess in the books that we do um or flashcards we do he sees them
um
no we just started practicing the sounds
more so um so he can do like ah the duck sound the train sound the cow sound
um dog
they won't he will he'll he just started mimicking those sounds but not what they are
but he seemed to understand a lot more though
like i i know wasn't talking too much but he seemed to understand
he seemed to understand everything
yeah
like if he can follow instructions
he he he does seem to know everything that you're saying
yeah
and i'm sure it sounds it seems like he knew some of the names too like of the food
like um i dunno it's like you said some of this stuff you've seen before
or like has has he seen you maybe eat some of the things
like certain foods we have
like i dunno
the cupcakes we have those frequently at our house
um he's a big cookie monster
as i um
the other foods apples we he knows fruits he knows
i guess most of those
yeah
um
i guess a lot of vegetables he knows
does he like eating vegetables at home a lot
he does okay um
he's going through a little bit of a period where he would prefer to only have juice and cookies
most two year olds
you know like sometimes you can get to eat their peas and
oh he'll he will yes if we time everything right
but yeah of course
precise timing
um and when we sit everyone together he eats great
um
am i answering your questions
yeah
sorry i'm just tryin see what's ahead
um
does he have any other like tools i know play with that
he does like tools
he has it at home
he uh has a everything
he would prefer to use real tools
um he finds screwdrivers and will try to take things you know the screws out of the toys or fix things
um little toys he i mean the little toys his tools he does okay with
yeah i mean the hammer yeah he'll bang away
we have the little thing that pull in and out
and
i think your little handy man
i guess that
yeah
he likes all that stuff
he loves to climb
he loves to be outside he's an outdoor he he prefers to be outside
yeah he's probably gettin tired of this room been here so long
swings bikes running jumping
yeah much more fun
dogs
i walk i'm a pet sitter so i walk dogs so he comes with me
oh
um so he just loves to squeeze them to death and
um hold the leash
hold the poop bag
well that's helpful
he's insistent on that
well i dunno someone has to do it right
we know it's a yucky thing and he holds it and goes yuck
but he won't let me take it back
we go to the trash can with it
aw
um
he's a good little helper
he's helping me clean up after everything
but i guess we do spend a lot of time outside he rides four wheelers
really wow
cool
um
tractor
anything with an engine he would prefer to
yeah
music he loves to dance
and uh have loud music
it can't be normal he has to turn it up
um and in the car he screams until it's loud
but he does thoroughly enjoy it and he will dance
and have a great time
aw
do you think um was did he play with kinda similar things than he usually played with in the other sessions i know there's different toys
um they are kinda similar
um
you guys never have a ball
and he oh he would love a ball
um and i i've noticed that at every session there's never a ball
probably cause they wouldn't leave i probably i'm guessing cause they would never stop playing with it maybe i dunno
maybe
yeah
um but he does and balloons he balls and balloons he loves
um
so it looks pretty similar like going for the food this time
i guess so
yeah i think that's pretty popular among the kids yeah
and the baby he liked the baby last time too
he did more with the dressing this time
um
starting to learn more
yeah oh he's smart and he figured it out
he does like to open and figure anything out
um do you have anything else you um want to tell us about or ask me anything
um
no just that he he does know a lot of japanese that i don't know so
do you huh do you think he's like hearing more than before because i think before you said he was hearing like ten percent
i'm sure i'd impact yeah he is
now it's at like fifty percent
does his grandma watch him a lot
yeah he seemed like when you were saying some things i'm i'm guessing they were in japanese like some words that popped up he seemed to get it
yeah i try to say both
yeah that's good so he can kinda learn both together
so
think she does too but i don't know how much
yeah and sometimes like you know like you were saying they might know it in one language and they don't know it in the other language they already have an influence
right like all most of his body parts he knows in japanese
so they need to learn two
and i don't know all those names

it might be a little small for you
it's made for a doll
chris does have a skirt like that doesn't she
she dressed up with you like that
i remember when she came downstairs and you guys showed your dress up
it was beautiful
well we don't have another dolly to put in those shoes
but maybe one of these dollies could change their shoes into those
