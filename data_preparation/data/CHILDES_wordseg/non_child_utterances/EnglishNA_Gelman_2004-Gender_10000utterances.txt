but this isn't a car is it

why would you want to hang on that microphone
because that's not what you're supposed to do with a microphone
oh but you don't need to reach it
you don't need it right in front of your mouth
she said just firstname said to speak louder
look at this picture
what is that person doing
she said just to speak loud so she can hear you she's going to tape record what you're saying so she can lis- she can look at it afterwards and see what you said
we are
well she'll she'll show you
she'll show you your tape
look at this
do we have one of these at our house
uh-huh
no you talk regularly like you do when you're in buzz lightyear
you know how you talk and you can replay it
well she can tape it on a tape recorder and she can replay it
okay
but we have to read this book because that's when you get done okay
no i'm afraid you might pull the ceiling down okay
sit down
we need to look at this book
that's what she said we had to do
because she wanted to see what we can see if we look at this book
okay touch it once
alright
what is this lady doing
no you know that does look likes she's putting flowers but she's not
she's dusting
you know how we get dust on the bookshelves and she's just dusting the books off
she looks pretty funny dusting without her shoes on huh
that's who
another little kid
that's which one
there is no blonde girl there
she has yellow hair
no that's orange hair
that one
that's a boy
do we have one of those
what is that
a rocking chair kinda like the one we were rocking on at the beach
but this one's the one that's in mom's room right
it's kinda like that
it says
who can do dusting
that's house work
does mommy do that or does daddy do that
i do that
why
i think they should draw a man dusting don't you
okay not dusting your face
mustache
what are you talkin about
for a mustache
oh i know you know who this is
who's that
what is he doing
look what he's doing
that's right
and what is he doing
what is this supposed to be
where is that no that's fire
what's this here
uh-huh the fire hydrant and is supposed to be what's coming out of the fire hydrant
right
and it says
who can be a firefighter
they don't say a fireman that could be a lady but that's a man he's got a moustache right
were talking about the moustache
what's wrong with that fire truck
oh i thought it only had one wheel
i know
i thought that was part of his hat
that's part of the wheel to the fire truck isn't it
and what color boots does he have on
what color
yellow and look he's fighting the fire
wow
okay who's this
you know why
you know have you seen the fire uh when they come and they service the fire hydrant in front of our house and they turn it on and they let the water out
but the only time you see a hose that's connected to the fire hydrant is if the fireman brings it on the truck
that's when you see the fire hoses attached but i'll show you we go home
right
remember he had that boat too on the truck
and you wanted to know why that sled was on the truck
well he got the fire hoses all wound up on the fire truck and then when he needs it he uncaps the fire hydrant and hooks it on and then he turns on the hose just like the um garden hose at home when you run through the sprinkler
where what
the hose
they didn't put the sled on there did they
and maybe it's this and it's laying down and that's the sled
i can't see it enough
it could be on the other side
could be
alright well what is this person doing
that's right
he's p- she's painting a house
that's a mom painting a house
yeah yeah
well what color is she painting
she's gonna paint the house red
and she's got a little door for um for the dog for the people to come out of the house
yes she is
isn't this a window
no
and this is the top of the house and what's this right here that's sticking up
no it's a chimney i think
is it
yeah i can't really tell for sure though
what
no
you know what i think
i think it is a door for the people
if you look at it this is the roof of the house and usually you see how she's standing on the ladder so she's real tall and way far up
and the door is actually longer down here so maybe it is for people
this isn't the house
this is like the top of the house
maybe this is the second floor window
right but it's really further down and they just cut the picture off down there so you can't see it
because can you can you see the chimney when you're standing on the ground
no so she's standing on a ladder so she's far up
but do you know what's funny
you can't tell where the roof ends and where the side of the house starts right
you think so huh
then the door will be red instead of brown huh

so you so men can knit sweaters
can who else can knit sweaters
women yup yup
who do you think does more knitting

this is something i think about
my grandma used to do a lot of knitting and tattiing
she used to make little tiny embroidered um doilies and table cloths
that's something that they used to teach women a long time ago
you were done with that page huh
on to the next
okay this one says
who can be a race car driver
who would be a race car driver
why would a man
could a woman be a race car driver
yeah
right
how come
because they're just as smart as a guy
do you think women are as smart as men
you're right you know that
and you know what else
some women are even smarter than men
a lot of men are
yeah
of course there are some men who are smarter than some women too
that's all- that's all you want to say
okay
who can play football
who's firstname
your counselor at camp can play football
is firstname a boy or a girl
a boy
that's oh
does his brother play
they're family
they're related right
lots of times people from the same family look the same don't they
we don't
i think we do
you picture your baby picture looks like my baby picture kind of
did you know that
so why you think they have a woman there throwing a football
it's because
does that look right
it does
so women can play football
and can men play football
is that is one of them better than the other at playing football
who's better
how come boys are better at football
why it's what um why is it why is it not likely a woman
i don't understand 
that doesn't tell me why
can you tell me why
i don't understand 
why is it you see it on tv all the time that's always men playing football
is that why
same thing for sewing
is it because we always see women sewing and not men
is that why
who can help bake cookies
who would do that
mm-hm
just girls
right
they should
they should help out just as much shouldn't they
come here can we sit down
here come here
here firstname they can hear you
just sit next to me
kids can help bake cookies too can't they
yeah but you probably wouldn't want to eat too many
you know why
you could get sick to your stomach
okay are we done with that
alright what does this one say
who can feed a baby
who is that
that's a daddy
do dads usually feed the babies
who feeds the babies most of the time
the women
why do you think they do that
mm-hm
well but the baby is their dad's son or daughter too
so why wouldn't he- why wouldn't he feed them more
but you just told me that you thought the women do it more
is that because you see 
or you just think they do it more
or you know they do it more
someone tells you
you know they do it more
how do you know
you know you are true
there's still more moms who stay home and take care of the babies and feed the babies more
and then a long time ago it was the moms who did all the times and the dads who never helped
and then the dads decided they did they missed out on playing with the babies and feeding them and they wanted to have more fun so they said to the mom
i want to help out some more
i want to be close to my kids so i'm going to help out more
i don't want the mom to have all the fun
right
do you think it's work or is it fun to feed a baby
it's fun
okay
what else do you want to say about that
anything else
nothing else
alright what's this one
who can be a cheerleader
who's usually a cheerleader
women
why
why
because you have to wear a skirt
you think a guy would look funny in a skirt
well you know what
when you go to big football games and stuff you see guys dressed up too they're not like they're not in a dress like a cheerleader
but there's what do they call 
there's a name for them spirit guys
and they go out there and what they do they need somebody strong so they have the guy lift the ladies up in the air and throw them up in the air and they yell and scream and cheer
but in the old days they used to just have women be cheerleaders
did you know that
okay
come here let's sit down
let's sit down
alright here's the next one
here look here
who's this
what's he what's he doing
i can't hear
can you talk louder
who can deliver the newspapers
is that a boy or a girl
a boy
do you think just boys can deliver newspaper
no
who else can
women
or or girls
yes that little girl is delivering papers
but it was her brother's paper route
she was just helping him
but anybody can have that job can't they
did you know one of our neighbors one of the dads lost his job at work
so he took a paper route
so it was a dad who was delivering newspaper
do you think that's a good idea
yeah because he needed money didn't he
i don't remember his name
no well he's a mailman
yeah
can a can a mailman be a man or a woman
yup
should be a mail person shouldn't it
that's the right way to say it because it can be a man or a woman
it's not just a mailman right
right
okay
who can play with toy trucks
do
girls and boys
do you think they both do it
do you think lots of girls play with trucks
do you think lots of boys play with trucks
yup
why is that
because you see do it
you think so
how come you think why do boys like trucks more than women
you think it's they make a loud noise and they can crash around
it's exciting
no
do you think girls like to do that
make all the sounds
be construction people
enough of that one
okay
uh let's see this one says
who can be a sailor
women
men both
and alien
now you're being silly aren't you
okay who would more likely be a sailor
a man or a woman
a man why do you think that
why
because women don't like to go on boats
you think so
did hey you know what
do you know daddy's aunt
firstname
she was a navy nurse so she was on boats for twenty years in the service
did you know that
she was a navy nurse so you can probably call her a sailor huh
do you think she liked being that
you don't want to discuss that one anymore
you're not interested in sailing huh
okay
who' this one say
who can pick flowers
anybody
so that's not just for girls or boys
or little kids
or big kids
no
why
you think they like that
but why
you ask me why all the time
i want to ask you why
here you're going to fall on couch
no
okay
do you like flowers
do you think firstname likes flowers
no
why not
he's a boy
here come here
you think you think uh boys don't like flowers as much as girls
yeah
why is that
is it their moms teach to be that way do you think
or you think their dads teach to be that way
do you really don't know or are you just goofing around
okay you're not are you being serious
okay shall we move on to the next one
okay here we need to be serious okay
we really want to know what you think
we think that you know a lot of things
and we're waiting for you to tell us how much you know
okay
here's another question
who can paint a house
here let's be serious okay
let's be serious okay
who can paint a house
people anybody
as long as you got an arm right
you got an arm they can paint
why not
you can paint with one arm
couldn't ya
well it might be hard but if you can climb up on a ladder you can paint right
okay
but you'd have to be able to see wouldn't you
you'd have to have eyes because in order to paint you need to see what you're doing huh
okay so that's a woman painting
do you think a lot of women like to paint
do you think they like to paint houses or do they paint pictures
and they're- and they're artists and they do women do more of that
who does more painting houses
men
why is that
do you think painting houses is harder
so is that why a man would do it
and is painting a picture easier
is that why a woman would do it
you think women can't do hard stuff
is that what you're telling me
they can't
how come
ohh so women don't have enough muscles
is that it
ohh
why is that
you don't know
okay
alright
who can be a firefighter
who's that
is that a man or a woman
a man
can only men be firefighters
mm-hm
prah- probably- do you see more men firefighters or women firefighters
more men
why do you think that is
you know why
probably because if you have to run into a building and save people they want you to be strong so you can lift out people and drag them out of the house
especially if they can't walk or if they're unconscious
that's probably why they want big strong people
so maybe if you're a big strong woman you could be a firefighter huh
what do you think
okay
here the next one is who does the dusting
who can do dusting
okay
are you serious with the dogs and cats
okay
what do you mean who can do more of the dusting
who does who can do that
do that
why why do women do that
because their moms teach and that's their job huh
do you feel that way
i feel that way sometimes
my mom taught me dust the house clean the house that's women's work
yeah
do you think that's fun
do you think it's fun cleaning it
do you think that should just be our job
right
if the boys get the house dirty too shouldn't they clean
yeah
so how about if we split the job fifty-fifty huh
no
what does that mean
ooh- move on okay
who can drive a truck
mm-hm
who who is this in here
yeah it looks like a woman
mm-hm
so women can drive trucks
mm-hm
where does she drive the truck at
well where does she live
on the farm yeah
so do you think lots of women who live on farms drive trucks
yeah
how women in the city
do you think they drive trucks
why not
why
because they don't have to
they don't have to work on the farm
do they have to drive truck may- probably because they prefer not to drive the truck
they want a bmw or a convertible like you huh
why
you you don't
you don't think you'd look cool driving a truck
no
you'd look cool driving a convertible
yeah
why do you think so
what you think you'll look like a boy
why would you look like an idiot driving a truck
you don't like trucks
you think most girls don't like trucks
why
okay
why because it's associated with work
or boys
is it boys drive trucks that you don't want to drive one
okay
who can play hopscotch
anybody can
yeah i ike to play hopscotch
who does the most hopscotch
kids
yeah
and of kids which kind of kids do the most hopscotch
girls
why is that
because they're more coordinated than boys
you think boys can't hop on one foot
they can or they can't
they can't
but are girls better than that
better than boys at hopscotch
or is is it because you have to sing a song

you think most boys don't like to dance
why don't they like to dance
they think it's sissy stuff
they think it's sissy stuff or maybe it's the costumes
the guys wouldn't like to wear tights right
come here on couch reaching microphone
you don't think boys like to wear tights
